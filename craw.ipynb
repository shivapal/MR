       "'GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X Trending: HAYWARD – As the North Coast Section Division II championship game entered the fourth quarter Saturday night, Bishop O’Dowd needed to find a way to get into the end zone against a tough Marin Catholic defense. Jelani Warren provided the answer two plays into the fourth quarter. The senior receiver turned upfield after hauling in a pass from Moe Flynn and saw daylight. Warren’s 51-yard touchdown reception tied the score at 15, and Gabriel Plascencia’s point-after-touchdown kick was the eventual winning point in a 16-15 victory at Hayward High. “It was just a simple slant-and-go Coach (Napoleon) Kaufman called. He recognized that my man was going to bite on the slant and I got a great quarterback who just threw me the ball perfectly,” said Warren about the touchdown. Bishop O’Dowd (12-2) then used the running of Austin Jones and a shutdown defensive effort to control the rest of the fourth quarter. The Stanford-bound Jones rushed for a tough 24 yards after Warren’s touchdown, including an eight-yard gain on a fourth-down run with 5 minutes, 39 seconds to go. That drive eventually ended with a missed 34-yard field goal attempt, but Bishop O’Dowd’s defense did not allow fifth-seeded Marin Catholic a first down on its final drive of the game. “That’s my mentality, just keep pushing,” said Jones, who had a 75-yard touchdown run as part of his game-high 163 yards on 27 carries. “Long runs are going to break eventually, you’ve got to keep pushing.” Warren had three catches in the second half and finished with four receptions for 89 yards. Flynn completed 14 of his 24 passes for 215 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He was 5 for 5 on his last five attempts for 96 yards and the touchdown. The Bishop O’Dowd defense also did an impressive job, limiting Marin Catholic (10-4) to just two touchdowns and 182 yards of total offense. One of the Wildcats’ touchdowns was on a short field after a low snap forced Dragons punter Francisco Romero to fall on the ball on the Bishop O’Dowd 10-yard-line in the third quarter. It was the second NCS title in three season for the Dragons, who won the Division III crown in 2016. Marin Catholic eliminated Bishop O’Dowd last year in the NCS Division III playoffs on the way to a title of their own. if ( \"undefined\" !== typeof googletag ) { googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article\"); } ); } “I’m just amazed at these kids and just the quality of character of these kids,” Kaufman said. “They fought hard all year. They are just special.” It looked in the first quarter like there could be a lot of scoring in this game. Marin Catholic drove 65 yards for the game’s first touchdown, a one-yard run by quarterback Gaven Cooke. Bishop O’Dowd answered back on its next play from scrimmage as Jones got around the left end, shook off two tackle attempts and sprinted 75 yards for a touchdown. A safety gave Bishop O’Dowd a 9-7 lead on the first play of the second quarter. On a fourth-down play, Bishop O’Dowd’s Athan Natsues made a tackle in the Marin Catholic end zone. But neither team was able to get into the red zone the rest of the half, as second-seeded O’Dowd held a slim 9-7 lead at halftime. Marin Catholic took advantage of the short field in the third quarter to score on another one-yard run by Cooke, then Cooke ran in a two-point conversion to give the Wildcats a 15-9 lead with 8:21 left in the quarter. Jones walked off slowly after a hit on a fourth-down play on the next possession. But he was back in the game for O’Dowd’s next possession, an 85-yard drive which ended with Warren’s touchdown catch. Meanwhile, Marin Catholic had only one first down in the last 17:10 of the game, as Bishop O’Dowd’s defense continued to play well. Marin Catholic’s final possession netted eight yards on four plays, as Bishop O’Dowd got the ball back with 1:22 remaining. Matteo Perez paced Marin Catholic in rushing with 95 yards on 17 carries.

Warren’s 51-yard touchdown reception tied the score at 15, and Gabriel Plascencia’s point-after-touchdown kick was the eventual winning point in a 16-15 victory at Hayward High. “It was just a simple slant-and-go Coach (Napoleon) Kaufman called. He recognized that my man was going to bite on the slant and I got a great quarterback who just threw me the ball perfectly,” said Warren about the touchdown. Bishop O’Dowd (12-2) then used the running of Austin Jones and a shutdown defensive effort to control the rest of the fourth quarter. The Stanford-bound Jones rushed for a tough 24 yards after Warren’s touchdown, including an eight-yard gain on a fourth-down run with 5 minutes, 39 seconds to go. That drive eventually ended with a missed 34-yard field goal attempt, but Bishop O’Dowd’s defense did not allow fifth-seeded Marin Catholic a first down on its final drive of the game. “That’s my mentality, just keep pushing,” said Jones, who had a 75-yard touchdown run as part of his game-high 163 yards on 27 carries. “Long runs are going to break eventually, you’ve got to keep pushing.” Warren had three catches in the second half and finished with four receptions for 89 yards. Flynn completed 14 of his 24 passes for 215 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He was 5 for 5 on his last five attempts for 96 yards and the touchdown. The Bishop O’Dowd defense also did an impressive job, limiting Marin Catholic (10-4) to just two touchdowns and 182 yards of total offense. One of the Wildcats’ touchdowns was on a short field after a low snap forced Dragons punter Francisco Romero to fall on the ball on the Bishop O’Dowd 10-yard-line in the third quarter. It was the second NCS title in three season for the Dragons, who won the Division III crown in 2016.

They are just special.” It looked in the first quarter like there could be a lot of scoring in this game. Marin Catholic drove 65 yards for the game’s first touchdown, a one-yard run by quarterback Gaven Cooke. Bishop O’Dowd answered back on its next play from scrimmage as Jones got around the left end, shook off two tackle attempts and sprinted 75 yards for a touchdown. A safety gave Bishop O’Dowd a 9-7 lead on the first play of the second quarter. On a fourth-down play, Bishop O’Dowd’s Athan Natsues made a tackle in the Marin Catholic end zone. But neither team was able to get into the red zone the rest of the half, as second-seeded O’Dowd held a slim 9-7 lead at halftime. Marin Catholic took advantage of the short field in the third quarter to score on another one-yard run by Cooke, then Cooke ran in a two-point conversion to give the Wildcats a 15-9 lead with 8:21 left in the quarter. Jones walked off slowly after a hit on a fourth-down play on the next possession. But he was back in the game for O’Dowd’s next possession, an 85-yard drive which ended with Warren’s touchdown catch. Meanwhile, Marin Catholic had only one first down in the last 17:10 of the game, as Bishop O’Dowd’s defense continued to play well. Marin Catholic’s final possession netted eight yards on four plays, as Bishop O’Dowd got the ball back with 1:22 remaining. Matteo Perez paced Marin Catholic in rushing with 95 yards on 17 carries.
