"Washington Sports Investor Leonsis Eyes Esports as Distribution Opportunity - The New York Times
OXON HILL, Md. — Ted Leonsis, who owns several Washington, D.C.-area professional sports teams and co-founded the esports company aXiomatic, said on Wednesday that he has invested in esports ventures partly in hopes of using their platforms as global distribution channels for his data and content.The sports mogul, who is founder and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment which owns Washington's hockey and basketball franchises, said game developers that are creating their own platforms ""are going to have their own streaming and... could be partners with us.""""I'd like to see us get more active in streaming our data and our content outside of the U.S., and that's why I've been making such big bets in esports,"" he told reporters during a sports betting conference sponsored by the American Gaming Association.With the boom in competitive video gaming and tournaments that can fill arenas with young fans, traditional sports and media companies have been trying to figure out how to enter the evolving space.At the same time, technology and game companies are creating cloud-based gaming platforms. Electronic Arts Inc, maker of games including The Sims, FIFA19 and Apex Legends, said in October that it was working on such a platform - where a game resides on an EA server instead of a gamer's device - called Project Atlas.The platforms could add another potential player in a widening field of digital, direct to consumer and over the top streaming options for sports and esports content.Like some other combinations of traditional sports and esports, Leonsis' holdings illustrate how the two realms are merging.Monumental owns five sports teams, including the Washington Capitals hockey team and the Washington Wizards basketball team, the Capital One Arena, training facilities and a regional sports network that streams live games directly to fans.Leonsis is also a co-chairman and owns a stake in aXiomatic, which has a controlling interest in Team Liquid, a global esports powerhouse with professional teams in 14 games.Axiomatic invests in Epic Games, creator of the wildly popular game Fortnite, and China's Tencent also holds a stake in Epic. Esports is especially popular overseas, and that appeal is expected to keep growing in coming years.""If you're a young person in India or China, you'll probably have more understanding ... of one of our e-sports players in 20 years than you will our person playing in the arena,"" Leonsis said.

"'Awakening' Happening in Women's Sports, Says LA Mayor Garcetti - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — The lawsuit recently filed by the U.S. women's soccer team is part of a wider public ""awakening"" to the challenges that women athletes face, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Reuters on Saturday. Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of an initiative aimed at the development of more women coaches, Garcetti said the suit against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging wage discrimination marked an important step toward gender equality.""I think there is an awakening happening in women's sports whether it's abuse, discrimination or simply having basic civil rights denied,"" he told Reuters.""I support women athletes who are saying enough is enough. That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,"" he said.""It's an exciting moment to see that happening."" Closing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women's sports leagues, he said.Women would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.""The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,"" he said. ""We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be."" The next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. ""I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,"" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.""Growing up I didn't see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,"" she said.""I guess I didn't realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,"" she said. ""And it's because they saw someone that looked like them.""  (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)"
"NHL Selects William Hill as an Official Sports Betting Partner - The New York Times
(Reuters) - The National Hockey League said on Thursday the U.S. division of UK bookmaker William Hill Plc will become an official sports betting partner of the NHL.The league will get marketing revenue from the sports book, which can use NHL brands in advertising, excluding the NHL's new puck and player data. Terms of the multi-year deal were not disclosed.Such commercial deals between sports leagues and bookmakers have been coming quickly since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last May to allow states to legalize, regulate and tax sports wagering.Eight states now offer legal sports betting, including Nevada, which was never subject to the prior federal ban and has sanctioned sports wagering for years.William Hill already has partnership deals with two NHL teams, the Vegas Golden Knights and the New Jersey Devils.The NHL in November announced a sports wagering partnership with FanDuel Group, a unit of Paddy Power Betfair Plc, coming on the heels of an agreement with MGM Resorts International.MGM agreed to pay for something that FanDuel and William Hill chose not to buy: the NHL's new and evolving trove of data it will generate from putting sensors inside pucks and on players' shoulder pads.The tracking technology generates 200 data points per second on players and 2,000 data points per second on the puck, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said.Such data could eventually be used to fuel specific, specialized in-game wagers, a kind of live betting that is likely to grow along with technological advancements and fan interest.In other deals with sportsbooks, ""the other leagues came up with this concept of you 'must buy official league data,'"" said Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill US, when talking to reporters during a sports betting conference sponsored by the American Gaming Association.But that is ""something that they can set monopoly pricing on, which is not a particularly attractive thing for a commercial actor like we are,"" Asher said. ""The NHL has not taken that approach.""If the NHL's experiment with puck and player data bears fruit in the future and can help Asher's business, ""then we'll certainly be on the phone looking to expand our relationship,"" he said.The NHL has an exclusive deal with Sportradar to provide the rest of the league's official live game data, which does not include the puck and player data.

"Lower-Profile Sports Are at Center of Admissions Cheating Scandal - The New York Times
They are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.In college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.Just like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.The Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.Unlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.That is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]In short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”The water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.The practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.Stanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.Federal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.At the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.According to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.Kathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”Even fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”Meghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.At U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.The coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.He told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”A month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.According to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.Stanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”No school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.Singer is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.The central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.The school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.Ali Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.Wake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.In a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”The case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.Prosecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.Later, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”“But she’s not,” Huneeus said."
"Breakdancing Among Sports Given Provisional Green Light for Paris 2024 - The New York Times
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Breakdancing was among four sports given a provisional green light for inclusion in the Paris 2024 Games by the International Olympic Committee on Wednesday, IOC President Thomas Bach said. The Paris 2024 organizing committee in February proposed surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing as well as breakdancing for inclusion in the Games. ""We decided to recommend the four sports (for ratification) to the IOC session in June in Lausanne,"" Bach told a news conference. ""It is a provisional inclusion because the final decision should only be taken at the end of 2020.""Surfing, climbing and skateboarding will be part of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and their performance as new sports there will be key for their final inclusion in Paris. ""There will be a meeting in November 2020 and a board meeting in December where the final decision should be taken. In the meantime there is a monitoring program... to see how they perform, to look at governance, integrity of competitions, refereeing and judging system,"" Bach said.The Paris Games organizers have said they want to deliver a program that will be ""in keeping with the times and inspire new audiences and attract young people ... and which can be played anywhere and anytime in urban and other environments.""Under new IOC rules first introduced for the Tokyo Games, Olympic host cities can hand-pick sports and propose them for inclusion in those Games if they are popular in that country and add to the Games' appeal. The IOC is eager to refresh the Games' sports program to remain relevant to sponsors, broadcasters and fans. (Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Toby Davis)"
"New Jersey Embraces Sports Gambling, and a Billion-Dollar Business Is Born - The New York Times
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.Every Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.She will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.By next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”Last May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.On the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.On the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”As sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.Figures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.Legalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.In two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.The Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.Last year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.At the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”The Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.Millman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”For now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”Kerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.With a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”"

"How to Find a Sports Bra That Actually Fits - The New York Times
At 12 years old, Holly Powell quit the swim team when her breasts outgrew her swimsuit. In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage."

"Opinion | The Admissions Scandal Is Really a Sports Scandal - The New York Times
This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.Getting a peek inside the college-admissions process isn’t easy. But a team of academic researchers managed to do so several years ago. It helped, no doubt, that two of the researchers were former college presidents — William Bowen of Princeton and Eugene Tobin of Hamilton.The researchers were given access to anonymous admissions records at 19 elite colleges and then analyzed how admissions offices treated different groups of students. Low-income students, for example, were no more likely to be admitted than otherwise similar students with virtually identical academic records. So-called legacy students — those whose parents attended the same schools — received substantial boosts. So did underrepresented minorities.But the biggest boost went to recruited athletes: An athlete was about 30 percentage points more likely to be admitted than a nonathlete with the same academic record.I thought of that study yesterday, after the Justice Department announced it had indicted 50 people for trying to rig the admissions process. The alleged scam involved payments funneled from parents to college coaches, who in return would falsely identify applicants as athletic recruits to the admissions office. Just like that, the students then become virtual shoo-ins for acceptance.If the accusations are true, they’re outrageous. But they also highlight a larger problem that has somehow become acceptable: A scam like this could exist only because competitive sports occupy a ridiculously large place in the admissions process. The situation is different for other extracurricular activities. Great musicians are more likely to be admitted to a college than similar students who don’t play an instrument — as is only fair, because musicians deserve credit for their accomplishments. But the musicians don’t generally receive a 30-percentage-point boost on their admissions chances. Stage managers for the high school theater don’t, either. Nor do student body presidents, debaters, yearbook editors or robotics competitors.Athletes do. Their extracurricular activities are not treated merely as an important part of a college application, but as a defining part. “Athletic recruiting is the biggest form of affirmative action in American higher education, even at schools such as ours,” as Philip Smith, a former dean of admissions at Williams College, has said. It’s a relic of the supposedly character-defining role that sports played in elite colleges a century ago. And sports have retained their unique place in the admissions process even though most teams at elite colleges are not good enough to compete for national championships. To put it another way, the student athletes being recruited to these colleges are not among the very best in the country at what they do. They are extremely good, yes, and they work hard, yes — but that also tends to be true of high school musicians, student government leaders and so on.I’m a sports fan and long-ago high school athlete. I have a lot of admiration for students who are talented enough and work hard enough to play sports in college. But they are not a different species. It’s time to end the extreme special treatment that colleges give to so many of them. College sports can still exist without it.For more …At many selective colleges, about one-fifth of first-year students are recruited athletes, and the share is higher at some. At Williams College, for example, about 30 percent of students are recruited athletes, according to the college.“Recruited athletes not only enter selective colleges with weaker academic records than their classmates as a whole but that, once in college, they ‘consistently underperform academically even after we control for standardized test scores and other variables,’” Edward Fiske wrote in a 2001 book review for The Times.The Times’s editorial board notes that the indictments do not challenge the legal uses of money to influence the admissions process: “What the government actually is defending is private property — the right of the colleges to make their own decisions about admissions, and collect the payments.” And my colleague Frank Bruni weighs in as well."
"Lobov Makes Bare-Knuckle Debut as Combat Sports Go Mainstream - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight Artem Lobov, a long-time friend and team mate of Conor McGregor, is set to make a lucrative debut in bare-knuckle boxing as combat sports bid to gain more mainstream acceptance. Nicknamed the ""Russian Hammer"", Lobov told Reuters he had accepted a big payday from the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship to fight another UFC veteran, Jason Knight, on a pay-per-view card in Biloxi, Mississippi on Saturday. ""I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse,"" he said during a stopover in New York. Long considered the only realistic professional alternative outside of boxing for combat sports athletes, the UFC is now competing with other mixed martial arts and grappling promotions. European and Asian promotions are attracting sellout crowds, and the Bellator organization recently signed a large number of British and Irish prospects to try to make inroads in Europe. They were also on the trail of Lobov when he was released from the UFC in January.""They made a very nice offer, a lot more than I was getting in the UFC, but it did not match the offer that Bare Knuckle made. With Bare Knuckle, I can also accept other offers as long as it doesn't interfere with their schedule, so it's a win-win for me,"" the 32-year-old said. ""I get to go in, fight bare-knuckle, make a lot of money, hopefully build a better name for myself and then see what else is out there.""FRONT FOOTThough he has a losing professional record of 14 wins and 15 losses, Lobov is hugely popular with fans due to his fearless style of fighting off his front foot and his toughness, with 12 of his MMA losses coming by decision. Lobov brushes aside the suggestion that bare-knuckle boxing is more primitive than MMA. ""It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times,"" he said. ""In that sense, it's nothing.""I truly, truly love fighting, so that's not an issue for me. It's like saying to a swimmer, 'Do you mind getting wet?' Of course not, he's a swimmer,"" he said. Lobov credits Irishman McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, with bringing combat sports into the mainstream in the U.S. and enabling him and many others to make a living as fighters. ""In many ways it is thanks to Conor, for sure, and it's definitely a lot better than before, but the best times are still ahead of us,"" Lobov said. ""Ten years ago I fought a top-10 European fighter on four days' notice for 400 pounds, and to go from that to where I am now, earning six figures for a fight? Certainly, I see the improvements in the sport.""Though delighted to have a chance to test his boxing without the threat of kicks or takedowns, Lobov will be back in the MMA cage soon. ""I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge. I'm still grappling, I'm still wrestling and doing everything,"" he said. ""I want to improve and to achieve many, many things in MMA, boxing and bare-knuckle boxing.""  (Reporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond)"

"Sports Betting Revenue Projection Was $11.5M. So Far? $150K - The New York Times
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Casinos in Rhode Island lost nearly $900,000 on sports betting in February after winning bets for the Super Bowl and other professional sports were paid out, the state lottery said Friday.Gamblers have placed a total of $53.5 million in wagers since the late November launch of sports betting in the state, with $53.2 million paid on winning bets, according to the lottery's figures for bets placed at Twin River Casino in Lincoln and Tiverton. The state gets 51 percent of sports betting profits, after subtracting expenses.That leaves Rhode Island with a profit of about $150,000. The state had projected it would get $11.5 million from the new market this fiscal year, which ends June 30.Many football fans went to the casinos in January and early February to bet on the victorious New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. In February alone, gamblers placed about $20.7 million in wagers and the casinos paid nearly $21.6 million on winning bets, for a $900,000 loss.Other states with legal sportsbooks that launched in the past year didn't bring in as much in February as they had in preceding months. New Jersey's physical sportsbooks had a tax bill of negative $6,000 for the month, but the online ones brought the state $1.7 million.Overall, most of the states with newly legal sports betting are on pace to fall short of their revenue projections, but none are lagging as far behind as Rhode Island.Rhode Island is just 1.3 percent of the way to its $11.5 million goal. Rhode Island Department of Revenue spokesman Paul Grimaldi said Friday that it will obviously be difficult to meet that goal and that the budget will have to be adjusted.""We'll be better able to project revenue as we get more experience,"" he said. ""I think the people who set their budget gave their best estimates based on the information they had and what the consultants were telling them. In some ways, we're learning a hard lesson.""Revenue for March is looking far better than February's figures due to the NCAA Tournament, Grimaldi said. Gamblers wagered $6.4 million during the first round of the tournament and the state is expecting about $500,000 in revenue from just that round, he added.Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Monday to allow sports betting to move online. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello introduced it to generate revenue and make betting more convenient.Ruggerio said Friday that the numbers will likely improve as the facilities are better prepared to accommodate everyone who wants to wager, with the self-serve kiosks that have been added and the future addition of mobile sports wagering.""It is doubtful that revenue figures will hold up to estimates, in large part due to a disappointing February, which was not unexpected due to the success of the Patriots,"" he said in a statement. ""With the NCAA basketball tournament in full swing, I anticipate that March numbers will be much better.""Raimondo's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 counts on $30 million from sports betting, including $3 million in new revenue from mobile gambling. Grimaldi said he thinks the $30 million estimate will likely be lowered.Rhode Island legalized and launched sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law last year that made most sports gambling illegal.___Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in New Jersey contributed to this report."
"AP: Most States' Sports Betting Revenue Misses Estimates - The New York Times
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — When the Patriots won the Super Bowl again — and covered the spread, too — all of New England was delirious, with the possible exception of Rhode Island's tax collectors.The state's sportsbooks lost $2.35 million because, come on, really, who's going to bet against Tom Brady in New England? That, in turn, cut into Rhode Island's tax revenue.For a variety of reasons, not just the Patriots' star quarterback, most of the states that moved quickly to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court cleared the way are still waiting for the expected payoff.Tax revenue has fallen far short of projections in four of the six states where gambling on sporting events started last year, according to an Associated Press analysis.Rhode Island, the only place in New England with legal sports betting, had expected to generate more than $1 million a month for its state budget through its 51% tax on sportsbook proceeds. The actual revenue? About $50,000 a month from the late-November launch through February, which included the Super Bowl.""The Super Bowl did hurt us tremendously,"" said state Rep. William O'Brien, who put $100 on the Patriots and won $100. ""But it made me very happy. I love the New England Patriots.""Gov. Gina Raimondo said the state might have to adjust its budget to account for the missed projections. Still, she is urging patience: ""We knew it was going to be very up and down. That is not at all a surprise.""States began legalizing sports gambling last year after the nation's high court ended Nevada's monopoly on the practice. In a seventh state, New Mexico, two Native American tribal casinos began taking sports bets without specific state authorization.West Virginia is taking in just a quarter of the monthly tax revenue it had projected. Tax revenue is half the estimate in Mississippi and Pennsylvania.The reasons vary by state, from slower-than-expected rollouts and the unavailability in some places of mobile betting, to an all-too-predictable Super Bowl, in which the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3, covering the 2½-point spread.In West Virginia, a contract dispute led to a shutdown at two sportsbooks and the state's only betting app at the beginning of the NCAA basketball tournament, eliminating crucial betting days. The state brought in $862,000 in taxes on sportsbooks from September through the first days of March. With just four months left in its fiscal year, that is well short of the annual projection of $5.5 million.The lower revenue isn't a surprise to state Sen. Michael J. Romano, a Democrat who opposed legalized sports gambling in part because he thought the state's 10% tax on it was too low.Republican state Sen. Craig Blair, a co-author of the legislation, said the revenue to date reflects growing pains. He said he wants to see more mobile options that could generate more betting.""The only thing I'm frustrated with is I would have probably liked to bet March Madness from my iPhone,"" he said.The AP found previously that taxes on sports betting would generate just a fraction of 1% of most states' budgets if they met their estimates. More than 20 states are considering legalization.Mississippi is on track to bring in about half the $5 million that was informally expected for the first year of sports betting. State Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat who opposed legalization for fear it would promote point shaving and other corruption, said it is too early to say whether the revenue will improve or the original projections were way off.Supporters in Pennsylvania are hoping for a boost with the start of online betting, expected this summer.The ability to place bets from a mobile device is a big reason New Jersey met its projections. From July through February, the state was bringing in about $1.8 million per month in taxes on sportsbooks. That's nearly as much as Nevada, which has had legal sports betting for decades and has not seen a drop-off despite the new competition.In Delaware, the only other state to meet projections, the majority of revenue came from a football-betting operation that has been around since 2009.Rhode Island, which missed its numbers by a wider margin than any other state, is hoping the addition of online betting will improve its tax haul. Last week, the governor signed a bill allowing it.Democratic state Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said sports betting is clearly popular, with more than $50 million wagered in Rhode Island during the first three months of operation.___Mulvihill reported from New Jersey.___Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Charlestown, West Virginia; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this story.___"
"Column: Boogity! Boogity! Boogity! Fox Sports Needs a Change - The New York Times
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Darrell Waltrip will soon ""Boogity! Boogity! Boogity!"" his way into retirement.It's time.And time for Fox Sports to look at deeper changes in its NASCAR television broadcast, too.Everyone yearns for an opportunity to say farewell on his or her own terms. Waltrip has that chance now to bring his second career as a NASCAR broadcaster to a close and squeeze out his classic catchphrase as Fox Sports' portion of the NASCAR schedule wraps up in June.NASCAR fans have demanded change in nearly every area of the sport, yet one area tiptoed around for some reason is the cracker-barrel, down-home broadcast Fox gives its audience for its coverage of the elite Cup Series. The 1-2 punch of Waltrip and Mike Joy spend too much time spinning yarns from the good 'ol days while relative newcomer Jeff Gordon awkwardly guffaws along with the gang.The carnival-like yukfest is stale, the cornpone of it all only magnified since the network began using current drivers in its coverage of the Xfinity Series. Kevin Harvick, Brad Keselowski and others have proven that by simply talking about the action in front of their eyes they can deliver an informative and entertaining program void of back-slapping tales and quips that consistently fall flat.Waltrip has hinted this could be his last season, ending a broadcast career that began with the 2001 Daytona 500 and Fox Sports' heralded acquisition of a slice of NASCAR's TV rights. He was in tears when brother Michael won the race at about the same time Dale Earnhardt was killed in a fatal crash elsewhere on the track.""Mikey! Alright!"" he cried. Then Waltrip looked at Earnhardt's wreck. ""How 'bout, Dale? Is he OK?""It was a historic moment, but in the years since, Waltrip has become a caricature of himself and the malapropisms and mistakes have only heightened the urgency for fresh voices. He also helped land a TV spot for his younger brother, who also has an over-the-top, aw-shucks persona.The Hall of Fame driver conceded in a January response to a Twitter user that his final race could be on the horizon.Waltrip acknowledged Fox Sports had assembled ""an amazing group of young and enthusiastic"" talent in his tweet, ""but they still need ""old guy"" wisdom, I'm happy to say that for another year that ""old guy"" will be me!""With 11 Cup races remaining in the network's coverage this season, there has been speculation Waltrip would announce his retirement as early as this weekend at Bristol Motor Speedway. The talk was so loud last week — with the assumption that Harvick is in line to replace Waltrip in the booth — that both the 2014 champ and his manager both insisted Harvick will still drive for Stewart-Haas Racing next season.Fox Sports said no announcement regarding its talent was currently scheduled.Waltrip is one of NASCAR's storied characters, one of the first to build a brand around his supersized personality, and he parlayed it into a lifetime as one of the sport's strongest ambassadors. But active as he is on social media, there is no way he has missed the overwhelming criticism directed his way over the past several days in particular. He seemed a bit muted Sunday at Texas Motor Speedway, and seemed slow to utter his ""Boogity! Boogity! Boogity! Let's go racing, boys!"" call to open the race.While Waltrip and Joy have been picked apart by those unhappy with the broadcast, Gordon has seemed trapped since his 2016 debut. The booth is not big enough for the two veteran egos and Gordon, the Hall of Famer who was supposed to be NASCAR's version of the athlete-turned-broadcaster that Tony Romo has become for CBS Sports.Still trying to shoehorn his way in while being respectful to his elders, Gordon has had to learn to insert his opinion and, well, correct Joy and Waltrip. Dale Earnhardt Jr., meanwhile, was an instant hit with his exclamations of ""Slidejob!"" for rival NBC Sports.Fox Sports, like everything else in NASCAR, needs a change and the first will likely be the 70-year-old Waltrip making the biggest call of his 19-season TV career — that it is time to hit the road. He made his debut in 1975 and has been part of NASCAR's road show ever since. He has seen it all, from the lean early days to NASCAR's popularity boom to its current fight to stay relevant.Retirement has never been his strong suit, though, and Waltrip hung around as a driver when his best days were behind him. He won 84 races and three Cup titles, but was simply turning laps at the end of his career. It was more of a celebrity-style goodbye tour anyway: The Fox deal was waiting for him and he went from the race car to the booth without a break.That was 2001, and the modern fan NASCAR is chasing to watch on TV or on their devices has little connection to a driver who made his last Cup start when today's budding stars like William Byron were still toddlers.Fox Sports has groomed drivers like Harvick to become broadcasters and has used Bobby Labonte, Regan Smith and new hire Jamie McMurray heavily on race day. The network grabbed analyst Ricky Craven and newshound Bob Pockrass when ESPN pulled out of NASCAR this season, and strengthened its commitment to the sport by investing in a state-of-the art virtual studio set in Charlotte. Fox's resources are deep, the pit reporting team is knowledgeable and Larry McReynolds has found a new role since Gordon replaced him in the booth.Fox Sports should not wait to address its booth until Harvick, who is under contract next season, or crew chief Chad Knaus or whomever is ready. The three-man booth has become passe and there are better ways to utilize the talent Fox Sports already has to freshen up the broadcast.The sooner Fox Sports and Waltrip acknowledge change is coming, the better it will be for the network and its star broadcaster. Fox can begin experimenting on how to approach next season and Waltrip can make one more farewell tour that honors his lifetime commitment and contributions to NASCAR. He can look forward to retirement as a NASCAR dignitary.He can also skip the Monday morning reviews.___"
"Sports Direct Considers 61.4 Million Pounds Bid for Debenhams - The New York Times
LONDON — Sports Direct, the British sportswear firm controlled by Mike Ashley, is considering an offer for Debenhams that values the ailing department store group at 61.4 million pounds, prompting a jump in the target firm's battered shares.Sports Direct, which last year bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration for 90 million pounds, has a near 30 percent stake in Debenhams and has been trying to wrest control of it for months.Ashley's latest move is an attempt to thwart Debenhams' restructuring and refinancing plan, which would give lenders more control over the retailer and could wipe out all shareholders.The terms of the possible offer would be 5 pence a share in cash - a premium of 127 percent to Debenhams' closing share price on Tuesday of 2.2 pence, which valued the firm at 27 million pounds. Shares in Debenhams were up 50 percent at 3.25 pence at 0945 GMT.Sports Direct said it would also assist Debenhams in addressing its immediate funding requirements but did not provide details. Debenhams' net debt at Jan. 5 was 286 million pounds.Debenhams has not yet responded to Ashley's latest salvo.Sports Direct's proposal is conditional upon Debenhams immediately appointing Ashley as its chief executive and terminating the noteholder consent solicitation process it announced last week. That process is seeking agreement from bondholders to change the terms of some of their bonds so that Debenhams can secure new loans of up to 200 million pounds from existing lenders.Debenhams has said that gaining those funds will allow it to pursue restructuring options to secure its future.While Debenhams has warned that some of these options would result in no equity value for current shareholders, its preference remains a solvent re-financing of the business.Bondholders have until Thursday to back the re-financing plan.Sports Direct said on Monday it was mulling a possible offer for Debenhams but did not put a price on it. That move got a cool reception from Debenhams on Tuesday.Under UK takeover rules Sports Direct has until April 22 to announce a firm intention to make an offer.

"Debenhams Needs Sports Direct Support to Prevent Shareholder Wipe Out - The New York Times
LONDON — Debenhams, the ailing British department store group, secured 200 million pounds in new funds on Friday but warned shareholders they still faced being wiped out unless major investor Sports Direct gave its support.Sports Direct, controlled by billionaire Mike Ashley, last year bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration for 90 million pounds and has been trying to wrest control of Debenhams for months. It already owns a near 30 percent stake.The 241-year-old Debenhams said Sports Direct needed to either make a firm offer for the group, underwrite a rights issue, or provide debt funding if it wanted to prevent Debenhams' ownership falling into the hands of lenders.Shares in Debenhams, down 86 percent over the last year, rose 39 percent, on hopes Sports Direct would make a bid.""Ashley's now between a rock and a hard place. He faces either seeing his stake in Debenhams disappear, or having to stump up cash to keep shares in the company alive,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf.Debenhams said on Friday the 200 million pounds was in two facilities. A first of 101 million pounds has been drawn but the second of 99 million pounds is subject to one of various ""milestones"" being reached by April 8.These include Sports Direct making a firm offer for the company that includes a refinancing of its debt and sufficient working capital.Alternatively Sports Direct can cancel its request for a meeting of shareholders to remove Debenhams' entire board, apart from its finance chief, and instead make a commitment to either underwrite a rights issue or provide debt funding.""If these milestones are not satisfied, the second facility would be available to the group's subsidiaries only upon transfer of those subsidiaries into the ownership of a lender-approved entity,"" Debenhams said.While this outcome would allow the business to continue trading ""it would very likely result in no equity value for the company's current shareholders.""Debenhams said it would also move to the next phase of its restructuring, which includes reducing rents and closing stores.""We will be contacting Sports Direct to outline once again the terms on which their constructive participation would be possible,"" said Debenhams.Sports Direct said earlier on Friday it was considering its options.On Wednesday Sports Direct had said it was weighing a 61.4 million pound offer for the company - a proposal conditional on Ashley immediately being installed as Debenhams' chief executive and the firm abandoning its refinancing plan.Shares in Debenhams were up 0.72 pence at 2.86 pence at 1239 GMT, valuing the equity at 34.4 million pounds.

"Ex-Sports Radio Host Craig Carton Sentenced in Ticket Resale Scheme - The New York Times
The sports radio personality Craig Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Friday by a longtime fan and listener — the judge — for a ticket reselling scheme that ended his broadcast partnership with the former N.F.L. quarterback Boomer Esiason.Carton, convicted in November of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud, was sentenced by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court.She greeted him like a radio listener.“Good afternoon, Mr. Carton. Colleen from New York. First time, long time,” the judge said, adding that she used to listen to his show as she drove to court.“I knew you could be fun to listen to,” she said. “I also knew you could be a jerk.”The prison term was half of what prosecutors sought after Carton was convicted at a November trial of soliciting and then largely gambling away nearly $7 million.Geoffrey S. Berman, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a release that Carton’s ticket resale business, which purported to use his connections to obtain good seats for events like Metallica and Barbra Streisand concerts, was an “elaborate fiction.”Carton, a 50-year-old Manhattan resident, blamed his fall from a measure of celebrity and wealth on “wildly stupid decisions” he made as he tried to cope with memories of being sexually abused at age 11.He said memories of the abuse were set off by revelations of the crimes of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State football assistant who was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2012. That led him first to speak angrily and more emotionally than he ever had before on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton” show, which he co-hosted for years with Esiason. Then he could not sleep.“Nobody knows what it’s like when lights go out and you lay in bed awake and the demons come,” Carton said.He recalled turning to blackjack and eventually developing a gambling addiction so serious that winning and losing became irrelevant.Carton said his arrest in 2017 was a “lightning bolt of awareness for me.” He said he had joined Gamblers Anonymous and was undergoing therapy.“I am truly powerless over this disease,” Carton said. His last bet — a loss — came in June, he added.Before describing the sentence, the judge said she had enjoyed Carton’s show, except when it became too “raunchy.”But she likened his crimes to those of the financier Bernard L. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence, though she said Madoff’s scheme, in which he squandered roughly $20 billion, went on far longer.The judge dismissed Carton’s claims that he never meant to lose investors’ money, saying it was a common justification in financial crimes.“The money always runs out at some point, and only then do you realize the road to your personal hell was truly paved with your good intentions,” she said.“Craig Carton, you have indeed descended into a hell of your own making,” the judge said. “Everything you spent a lifetime of building up is gone. Your marriage is over. Your family is decimated. Your kids are terrified. Your career is in tatters. Your reputation is lost.”She did, however, praise Carton’s plan to publicly urge others to stop gambling as she ordered him to pay $4.8 million in restitution and to forfeit $4.2 million. He also must do 150 hours of community service.She said Carton could perhaps someday resume a radio show, which he left after his arrest, but she noted one of the biggest advertisers on sports radio shows seemed to be legal gambling businesses.“That troubles me,” the judge said.Carton must report to prison on July 15."

"Dan Jenkins, 90, Chronicler of Sports in Raucous Prose, Dies - The New York Times
Dan Jenkins, a sportswriter whose rollicking irreverence enlivened Sports Illustrated’s pages for nearly 25 years and animated several novels, including “Semi-Tough,” a sendup of the steroidal appetites, attitudes and hype in pro football that became a classic of sports lit, died on Thursday in Fort Worth. He was 90.He had experienced heart and renal failure and had recently broken his hip, said his daughter, Sally Jenkins, a sports columnist for The Washington Post.Mr. Jenkins was among a cadre of Sports Illustrated writers — including Roy Blount Jr., Mark Kram and Frank Deford — recruited by André Laguerre, the managing editor who oversaw the magazine’s emergence as a leader in literate, and occasionally literary, sports journalism as well as a powerhouse in the Time Inc. stable. Mr. Jenkins joined the magazine in 1962.A Texan with a good old boy’s pride in country common sense over urban sophistication, Mr. Jenkins brought a Southern wiseacre erudition to the pages of a magazine not exactly used to the arch or earthy or impolitic remark. Opinionated, more than occasionally snarky, he wrote with an open appreciation of athletes and coaches, bars, pretty women and chicken fried steak, replete with clever put-downs and outlandish metaphors.His main beats were golf and college football, sports he grew up with in Fort Worth.“The devoted golfer is an anguished soul who has learned a lot about putting just the way an avalanche victim has learned a lot about snow,” Mr. Jenkins wrote in an article for the magazine that earned him a full-time job there. “He knows he has used straight shafts, curved shafts, shiny shafts, dull shafts, glass shafts, oak shafts and Great Uncle Clyde’s World War I saber, which he found in the attic. Attached to these shafts have been putter heads made of large lumps of lead (‘weight makes the ball roll true,’ salesmen explain) and slivers of aluminum (‘lightness makes the ball roll true,’ salesmen explain) as well as every other substance harder than a marshmallow. He knows he has tried 41 different stances, inspired by everyone from the club pro to Fred Astaire in ‘Flying Down to Rio’ and as many different strokes. Still, he knows he is hopelessly trapped. He can’t putt, and he never will, and the only thing left for him to do is bury his head in the dirt and live the rest of his life like a radish.”Mr. Jenkins was fond of toying with racial, ethnic, national and social stereotypes in a distinctly non-P.C. manner, and was especially defiant in doing so outside the stricture of magazine journalism, particularly in “Semi-Tough” his first and best-known novel, published in 1972.The book is narrated by Billy Clyde Puckett, a star running back for the New York Giants and a Fort Worth native.Set in the week leading up to an all-New York Super Bowl in which the Giants are to face the Jets, the novel is a pouring out of Billy Clyde’s observations and attitudes — brash, cynical, boastful, charming, shrewd, rip-snortingly vulgar and often hilarious — as he speaks into a tape recorder for the purpose of publishing a book.What results is a hyperbolic, first-person report on a world whose lexicon involves all manner of stereotype and slur and whose concerns are more or less confined to food, drink, drugs, money, sex, digestive excretions and football. Often cited as among the funniest sports books ever written, it came in at No. 7 on Sports Illustrated’s 2002 list of the top 100 sports books of all time.“I loved it,” David Halberstam wrote in The New York Times Book Review. “I read it aloud to my wife, who does not like football one bit, and she loved it. It is outrageous. It mocks contemporary American mores. It mocks Madison Avenue; it mocks racial attitudes; it mocks writers like me; and it even mocks sportswriters for Sports Illustrated like Dan Jenkins.”“Semi-Tough” was adapted for a 1978 movie that starred Burt Reynolds as Billy Clyde Puckett.Dan Thomas Jenkins was born in Fort Worth on Dec. 2, 1928, although many sources list the year as 1929. His father, E. T. Jenkins Jr., known as Bud, was a salesman, a gambler and evidently a charmer who left the family when Dan was a toddler, though he showed up now and then to take his son to sporting events.In a 2014 book, “His Ownself: A Semi-Memoir,” Mr. Jenkins expressed a fondness for his father, as well as for his mother, Catherine (O’Hern) Jenkins, whom he described with arch affection as a self-indulgent character who sold antiques and remodeled houses “and ultimately invented the migraine headache.”From the age of 2, Mr. Jenkins grew up — contentedly, he wrote, in spite of the Depression — in the home of his father’s parents. He became the first member of the family to go to college, — at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, where he played on the golf team. One of his early heroes, the golfer Ben Hogan, also lived in Fort Worth, and Hogan became something of a mentor, admired by Mr. Jenkins for his work ethic, perseverance (Hogan returned to championship golf after nearly being killed in a car accident in 1949) and devotion to excellence.Mr. Jenkins got his first job in journalism in the mid-1950s, at The Fort Worth Press, hired by Blackie Sherrod, a writer and editor who would himself become celebrated in Texas as a Southern Damon Runyon. Mr. Jenkins succeeded Sherrod, whom he cited as an influence, as sports editor before landing at Sports Illustrated.Mr. Jenkins’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In 1959, he married June Burrage, whom he had known while growing up in Fort Worth. She survives him. In addition to his daughter, his survivors include his sons Marty and Dan Jr., a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter.Mr. Jenkins plumbed the homey if earthy wisdom of Fort Worth in a number of books after “Semi-Tough,” including the novels “Dead Solid Perfect” (1974), about a professional golfer in the swaggering Billy Clyde mold, and “Baja Oklahoma” (1981), about a feisty waitress and single mother with aspirations to be a country singer; both became television movies.Another novel, “You Gotta Play Hurt” (1991), a sendup of the sportswriter’s life, tells of a cantankerous Fort Worthian and the stuffy, big time magazine he works for. Mr. Jenkins wrote it after leaving Sports Illustrated in the 1980s in a dispute with the managing editor at the time, Gilbert Rogin.He went on to write for Playboy and was a senior writer for Golf Digest, where in 2014 he created a squall with a parody of an interview with Tiger Woods in which he portrayed Mr. Woods as being arrogant and spoiled. In a response on The Players Tribune website, Mr. Woods called the article “a grudge-fueled piece of character assassination.”“Journalistically and ethically,” he wrote, “can you sink any lower?”Mr. Jenkins’s other books include “Limo,” a 1976 novel written with Bud Shrake, an old pal from Fort Worth who also wrote for Sports Illustrated; it satirizes network television by depicting the creation of a show that prefigures today’s reality programming.None of Mr. Jenkins’s subsequent novels had the impact of his first. This was partly because the bawdy audacity that characterized “Semi-Tough” seemed less audacious in later books, and partly because the characters espousing the attitudes and employing the language favored by Billy Clyde and friends struck many readers as much less appealing as public attitudes changed.Mr. Jenkins openly lamented this societal swivel. His characters spoke bitterly of it in his later novels, and his memoir, though full of vintage Jenkins phrase-turning and storytelling about the good old days of sports and sportswriting, is spiked with a sour loathing of what he called political correctness; the book, echoing the opening of “Semi-Tough,” contains some ill-humored and offensive remarks about Asians.As the Times book critic Dwight Garner noted in his review of the memoir, “His anti-P.C. campaign is where his geezer routine crosses over into something worse.”“Now this writer is going to be partly remembered for this stuff,” he added, “which is a shame.”It’s a shame, Mr. Garner wrote, because of how generous Mr. Jenkins was.“I woke up with a smile on my face every morning during the two or three days I spent reading ‘His Ownself,’ ” he wrote. The book, he said, is “one of those books that reminds you that good stories happen only to people who can tell them.”"
"Using Sports Psychology for Childbirth - The New York Times
Any woman who has ever carried and birthed a child, in whatever fashion, deserves her own ESPN highlight reel — blood, sweat, tears and the eventual triumph of holding her newborn baby. To be clear, childbirth isn’t a game. You can’t plead with the referee when you don’t like a call or leave the field when you’re tired. Still, as a lifelong athlete, I saw childbirth, especially an unmedicated one, as the ultimate challenge of physical endurance, mental stamina and my ability to handle pain.When I became pregnant in January 2018 and set about preparing for the monumental task of birthing a human, I loaded up on prenatal vitamins, kept a daily routine of birthing stretches and exercises, and endured an eight-week birthing course. An image of the lead female competitors in the New York City Marathon, who bring me to tears when they run past my Brooklyn apartment each year, filled me with confidence for labor. Washboard-like abs. Lean legs showing off every strand of muscle. Calm, focused and confident expressions on their faces.However, as my due date came near, I clung to a fear of pain and the unknowns out of my control. How long would my labor be? Would my mind fall apart? What if my pelvis wasn’t the optimal shape or I stopped dilating?I wanted to face childbirth with the same kind of confidence that radiated from the runners I admired. So I turned to sports psychology for advice.The field typically uses a hodgepodge of methods like cognitive behavioral therapy and attention control training to improve athletic performance and competitor experience. It suits a laboring woman because it can quickly provide practical tools to achieve a specific goal, said Jay-Lee Nair, a Singapore-based sports psychologist who works with athletes, including professional golfers and Olympic sailors, as well as women preparing for labor. A simple strategy could be mimicking an athlete’s pregame routine like reciting affirmations “reminding them about their game plan or the attitude they want to have,” she said.To help me labor like an Olympian, Dr. Nair challenged my unhelpful birth beliefs with rational facts. In the sports context, an unhelpful thought could be “believing a win in a tournament was because of luck or lesser skilled competitors,” she said.I have a fear of operations and for me, undergoing a cesarean would take more guts than an unmedicated labor. Dr. Nair advised me to gather positive cesarean stories for a process called cognitive restructuring, in which fact-based alternative statements dispute the irrational belief. I was under the impression that a mother could not pick up her child for six weeks after a cesarean, but many of my friends assured me that they could within days.“It is hard just like a natural birth is hard, and you’re still amazing for going through that,” Dr. Nair said.Joan Steidinger, a sports psychologist based in the Bay Area and a former ultramarathon runner, told me to develop a mindfulness plan by identifying the extremely difficult moments in labor — the 45-minute cab ride to the hospital under the onslaught of contractions topped my list — and to design a predetermined meditation for each. She used this strategy when she prepared runners for the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run, in which the track goes through canyons with stagnant 110-degree air. “You might visualize a cool waterfall, something to take your mind off the situation,” said Dr. Steidinger.I still wondered how athletes reframe their minds if something doesn’t go as planned mid-competition. How does a figure skater shift from aiming for gold to finishing her four-minute routine with dignity when she doesn’t land a jump that took months of practice? “What we usually do is create some kind of action they do to refocus because an action connects mind and body,” said Caroline Silby, a former figure skater turned sports psychologist. That could mean pushing down on the ice or drawing a deep breath to move beyond failure, Dr. Silby said.The physical cue I developed to help me reframe mid-labor started with clenched fists during an inhale and then opening them during an exhale, with my palms up in a surrender. I would surrender to the difficult moments or to whatever my body needed for a safe birth, whether that was every intervention under the sun or nothing at all.The idea of pain with a purpose is common in sports and labor. So are breathing techniques and visualizations to cope. Visualizations didn’t do it for me, but breathing did. During my birth class, I figured out what I liked — a long, loud exhale where I focused on the vibrating hum inside my mouth. I practiced this a few times each week while holding a piece of ice (it’s surprisingly painful). Dr. Silby added a tip: Stay present and enjoy the rest between contractions, much as a marathon runner turns a downhill section into active recovery. “If you’re anticipating the next painful push during recovery, that is a waste,” she said.After an anxious and tearful 13 days beyond my due date, contractions started on a Monday evening. Labor quickly became a familiar rhythm, not unlike my favorite workout of high-intensity interval training where, say, a minute of squats is followed by a 20-second break.By 3 a.m., my contractions were down to three minutes apart, our cue to head to the hospital. Excitement. Anticipation. And then my labor stalled. I used my physical cue — releasing clenched fists — again and again to move beyond the disappointment.My mind held it together until around midday. Why did my stupid body slow the contractions? At the same physical and mental crossroads in a soccer match, I would have raised my hand for a substitution so a more energized teammate could finish what I started. But this was labor. I was the only one who could birth this baby.After some bleeding at 2 p.m., my obstetrician advised me to come into the hospital. I assumed I had hours left and that beautiful thought “epidural” appeared on the horizon. However, my body had other ideas.When I got in the cab, my contractions were 10 minutes apart. When I got out, the contractions were coming every two minutes and my water had broken (yes, in the cab). Minutes later I was in a labor room. I pushed, the obstetrician pulled, my doula held my leg back and my mom propped my head up. It was freeing to finally enlist some brute strength.After almost 24 hours of labor, and half an hour of pushing, just 90 minutes after arriving at the hospital I had my slimy, alert and, at 9 pounds, 8 ounces, very large son.The strategies borrowed from sports psychology got me somewhat gracefully through labor. But they are not foolproof. Like Serena Williams at this year’s United States Open final, even elite athletes have their trying moments. I did, too, just as I entered the homestretch of my labor.Less than two weeks after the birth, I stood on the stoop to watch the New York City Marathon, holding my sleepy newborn. The lead women ran by at their cracking pace, elegant and forceful. A tunnel of spectators along the avenue celebrated them. As usual, I had tears in my eyes. But this year, I felt that I was in their elite league.Serena Solomon is an Australian journalist based in New York."
"Sports Direct Chief Offers to Underwrite Debenhams Rescue for CEO Job: Financial Times - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley has offered to underwrite a 150 million pound ($196 million) rights issue at Debenhams on condition he is named CEO of the British department store chain, the Financial Times reported on Saturday, citing two sources.The owner of the sportswear firm is also considering a 60 million pounds takeover bid for Debenhams this weekend, the Sunday Times said in a separate report.A formal offer is being put together by him and would come with conditions, the Sunday Times said, citing an unnamed source.Debenhams secured 200 million pounds in new funds last week but warned that shareholders still face being wiped out unless it secures financial support from Sports Direct, which holds a near 30 percent stake.Debenhams said Sports Direct needed to either make a firm offer for the group, underwrite a rights issue of new stock, or provide debt funding if it wanted to prevent Debenhams falling into the hands of its lenders. In a letter to the Debenhams board dated April 5, Sports Direct said it would be willing to underwrite the group with 150 million pounds in cash if Ashley was named as CEO, the FT said.Sports Direct was not immediately available for comment and Debenhams declined to comment.Last year Sports Direct bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration and it has been trying to wrest control of Debenhams for months to further beef up its presence in the sector.

"Letters to the Sports Editor - The New York Times
To the Sports Editor: Re “For Jackie Robinson’s Centennial, a Display of Rarely Seen Photographs,” Jan. 31: In my 80s now. The special section about Jackie Robinson is a forever treasure.In my boyhood in Logansport, Ind., a childhood friend of my father’s was Johnny (Red) Corriden, who made the big leagues and was a Brooklyn Dodgers coach in the 1940s. At the end of the season, he would stop by our home in Logansport, and each visit Red would say, “Here Johnny” and present me with a brand-new official major league baseball.This writer, only 7 when this started and 1,000 miles from Brooklyn, became a lifelong Dodgers fan. Along came 1946, and Robinson was at Montreal. Everything possible was read about him, and then came 1947. (Corriden by then was a Yankees coach.)My local drugstore for some wild reason had a Jackie Robinson comic book for sale. With 10 cents from my allowance, I got the comic book and was reading it on the front porch when my father, a white man born in 1891, saw me with it and said, “Son, it’s all right that you root for that colored and all right that you read that comic book, but do not let anyone know about this.”For a 10-year-old who believed that his parents were always right, there was stunning mystification. In the early spring of 1947, we rode the train to Chicago to see the Dodgers play the Cubs. We had good seats near the visitors’ dugout (somehow Corriden arranged this, even though he was with the Yankees).As not everyone knows, Robinson played first base his rookie year. When he stepped out of the dugout, in the Dodgers’ traveling grays, and made his pigeon-toed trot to first base, all at once two things were known by me: My all-time sports hero was right before my eyes, and my father had feet of clay.This watershed moment has affected my views about civility forever. On the 40th anniversary of Robinson’s rookie year, I sent a short note to Rachel Robinson, Jackie’s widow, simply stating that his heroism had reached and forever touched a 10-year-old a thousand miles away.John F. DunnDecatur, Ill.To the Sports Editor:My fanatical loyalty to the distant Brooklyn Dodgers led to many fights and much peer mockery (as the Dodgers lost too many World Series) when I was 6 in a 1950 Larchmont, N.Y., neighborhood of Yankees fans.Jackie Robinson, my hero, ran faster, hit more cannily, executed double plays and taunted opposition pitchers and infielders with greater skill, guts and swagger than anyone else in the game (to the best of my unstatistical knowledge). Stealing home, to my later Little Leaguer’s mind, was nearly impossible, but Robinson succeeded 20 times and attempted even more.At first, I did not know his race. I did not understand such categories. He was just the greatest ballplayer. A little older, I knew better and learned that getting to first base was only one of the difficulties that faced my American hero (in every sense of that word).So when “next year” became “this year” (some readers will understand that phrase), tears came to my eyes. When the Dodgers moved to L.A., it happened again. When Jackie Robinson died young, I wept. When I read The Times’s special section, once more I cried.Donald LateinerDelaware, OhioTo the Sports Editor:As deserving as Jackie Robinson is of all the attention he has received, it is a shame that Larry Doby is all but ignored. Doby broke the color barrier in the American League two months after Robinson broke in with the Dodgers. He faced all the same difficulties as Robinson, overcame all the same hurdles and persevered to have a great career, helping Cleveland win the 1948 World Series. Yet we see no biopics or retrospectives of Doby. No. 42 has been retired from baseball, but No. 14 goes unhonored. Perhaps playing in New York is the reason for the difference. But whatever the reason, there is no doubt that Doby is in fact deserving of recognition to the same degree as Robinson.Mark B. CohnNaples, Fla."
"Their News Isn’t New: Sports Anchors in the Era of Social Media - The New York Times
Scott Van Pelt closed an episode of “SportsCenter” last month with a two-minute monologue about the 31st anniversary of his father’s death. Strengthened by two friends who had recently lost their parents, Van Pelt spoke passionately about running from grief, and encouraged everyone to do the opposite — to articulate their pain so they could overcome it.The segment went viral. It embodied the essential traits of Van Pelt’s version of ESPN’s flagship show — sensitivity, nuance and the courage to be vulnerable — that help him connect with viewers.“It’s a great reminder of the power of the microphone we hold in our hands,” Van Pelt said.But that power is changing — disappearing, even — as television viewing habits change and sports media develop new ways to bring fans what they want when they want it. (Now!) That means what was once a premier placement in TV sports — the anchor desk — is not the high perch it used to be. It is not clear anymore what it is at all.Not so long ago, sports fans operated on a schedule dictated by the programming that was available on TV. The sports highlight show, “SportsCenter” being the most popular one, was appointment viewing.It was where sports fans went to see the highlights they could only read about in the newspaper. People came to know its anchors: Keith Olbermann, Linda Cohn, Stuart Scott, Robin Roberts, Dan Patrick, to name a few. They complemented the sports clips with their own personalities and, in the case of Scott, redefined the highlight show genre.But today, highlights flood fans’ Twitter timelines immediately: a buzzer beater on loop seconds after it drops through the net; a touchdown from multiple angles before referees have ruled it good. They flood our Instagram feeds thanks to users like House of Highlights, which delivers the day’s most important sports highlights to more than 12 million followers.“SportsCenter,” even with six editions each weekday, can no longer dangle the carrot of providing clips unavailable anywhere else. On most nights, when the highlight package rolls, Van Pelt is telling a majority of the viewers about something they have already seen.“Every person covering sports is trying to figure out the riddle,” Van Pelt said. He asked how a program could deliver highlights “to you in a way that you will want it and convince yourself that you will need it.”Omar Raja, 24, is the founder of House of Highlights. He grew up watching sports highlights on the local news with his father every morning. When Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006, he did not find out about it until he turned on his TV the next morning.“It’s crazy to think 10 years ago, we had to wait until the next day to find out what happened the night before,” Raja said.Raja’s team can now offer instant access to what everyone is talking about. But Raja thinks traditional and new-age highlights delivery systems can coexist. He still watches “SportsCenter,” after all, especially Van Pelt’s midnight edition.“I don’t really listen to him for the highlights,” Raja said. “I just listen to him for his thoughts on things. He’s a good personality, and he’s charismatic.”When Van Pelt took over as anchor in 2015, he said, he decided to lean on his personality and trust the audience to connect with his curiosity about sports.Per ESPN, Van Pelt has consistently generated higher ratings among 18-to 34-year-old men in his midnight time slot than late-night talk shows on broadcast or cable. Other sports anchors have tried a similar approach, to lesser degrees of success.Jay Onrait and Dan O’Toole’s show on Fox Sports went through several iterations before pivoting toward a late-night show format; it was canceled in 2017. Jemele Hill and Michael Smith were chosen to overhaul the 6 p.m. “SportsCenter,” but the reformatted show — called “SC6” or “The Six” — lasted a little more than a year before it was broken up in 2018. During its run, Hill was criticized for a post to her personal Twitter account about President Trump, and for another about the N.F.L., for which ESPN suspended her.“To ignore the racial component and the climate that they faced would be completely dishonest,” Van Pelt said of Hill and Smith, who are African-American. “They faced challenges that I didn’t face. They also didn’t have the benefits that I have.”Those benefits include a midnight slot that allows Van Pelt to experiment in front of a smaller potential audience, and stronger lead-ins from “Monday Night Football” during the N.F.L. season.Onrait, who now hosts “Jay and Dan” on TSN in Canada at midnight, has adopted the sensibilities of a late-night talk-show host in this turn as a sports anchor.“Personality is what’s going to rule the next phase of television,” Onrait said.Others, such as Skip Bayless of Fox Sports, combine so-called “hot takes” with continuous criticism of high-profile athletes like LeBron James to connect with viewers.“The only thing that really worked at Fox was Skip,” Onrait said. “Nothing was working until Skip showed up. No one got ratings. I know lots of people have made a living out of crapping on the guy, but what he did was bring actual viewers to the network. He was the only one who did that.”In a statement to The New York Times, Norby Williamson, an ESPN executive who oversees “SportsCenter,” pushed back against the idea that the show is becoming obsolete.“We recognize that people have many options for viewing highlights now, but we continue to develop presentations that you’re not going to see anywhere else,” Williamson said. “We’ll show you what happened but also how it happened and why.”While ESPN still sees its network and the “SportsCenter” franchise as vital to the fan’s experience, what really matters is whether viewers will continue to see it this way.Van Pelt knows that reckoning is coming soon.“I keep thinking to myself this is a short window,” Van Pelt said. “It won’t go on forever.”"
"Sports Direct Weighs Debenhams Options After Bondholders Back Restructuring - The New York Times
LONDON — Sports Direct, the group run by Mike Ashley that is seeking control of Debenhams, said on Friday it was considering its options after the ailing department store group secured bondholder support for an alternative refinancing plan.Sports Direct, which has a near 30 percent stake in Debenhams, said on Wednesday it was considering a 61.4 million pounds offer for the company.The proposal was conditional on Ashley immediately being installed as Debenhams' chief executive.Another condition was that the department store group terminate a process seeking agreement from bondholders to change the terms of their bonds so that it could press ahead with securing 200 million pounds of extra funds from lenders and pursue restructuring options.Debenhams warned last week that those options would give lenders more control over the retailer and some of them could result in no equity value for its current shareholders.Debenhams pressed ahead with seeking agreement from bondholders and said on Thursday that they had backed its plan.Shares in Debenhams were down 6.6 percent at 2 pence at 0952 GMT, valuing the equity at 24 million pounds. As of Jan. 10 the firm had committed debt facilities of 520 million pounds. (Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Keith Weir)"
"E-Sports Embraces Traditional Training Methods: Less Pizza, More Yoga - The New York Times
COPENHAGEN — The squats and leg lifts were harder than they looked, and after a few sets, Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez placed his hands on his knees and attempted to compose himself.In November, Aguirre, a 24-year-old professional video game player from Spain, joined the five-man roster of Origen, a League of Legends team that competes in the game’s top European league. The players — all signed in late fall — were told at the time that the team might be run a bit differently from what they were accustomed to. Now here they were, five young men who make their living sitting almost completely still in front of desktop computers, sweating through an hourlong workout in a cramped gym.“I think I’m going to puke my oatmeal,” said Aguirre, who is known in the gaming community as Mithy. “I’m dying.”Some years ago, traditional sports leagues were revolutionized by young analysts wielding computers. The way things had always been done, it turned out, was not always the best way to do things. Now echoes of that transformation have arrived in the growing world of professional e-sports, where gamers are being shepherded toward a new frontier, oddly, by the old, corporeal wisdom of traditional sports.The debate about whether competitive gamers can be considered athletes may never end. In the meantime, though, gamers are increasingly acting like them.Origen is one of two teams owned by Rfrsh Entertainment, an e-sports company based in Copenhagen. Two years ago, the organization hired Kasper Hvidt, a former captain of Denmark’s national handball team, to be its sporting director. Hvidt, 43, had no previous exposure to gaming. But that was the point.E-sports in recent years have crept into the mainstream, attracting new fans, new sponsors and new investment. The top professionals now make six-figure salaries and earn even more with endorsements and prize money. And yet, Hvidt observed, their approach to performance remained amateurish.Eating right, sleeping right, exercising, cleaning up for sponsors — these ideas have undergirded traditional sports for generations. In e-sports, they are regarded as almost radical.“They don’t look at themselves as physical human beings,” said Hvidt, who won the European handball championship with Denmark in 2008.“It’s common sense, in a way. But with them it was not.”Rfrsh has a validating narrative under its belt. The company’s other team, Astralis, which competes internationally in the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had gone almost a year without winning a tournament when Hvidt joined the organization in mid-2017. In 2018, the team earned $3.7 million in prize money while putting together one of the most dominant years ever by any team in any e-sports game.And so Origen this year has set off on the same journey of athletic self-improvement. As recently as last year, the players’ typical day might have been a sedentary extravaganza of sugary energy drinks, fast food and unresolved psychic tension. Now, their days are interposed with protein smoothies, yoga mats and slow-paced breathing exercises.The effects of those changes, the team said, have been plain to see: After starting the current season with a 1-4 record, Origen went on a tear, winning 11 of its final 13 matches, finishing the regular season in second place and securing a first-round bye for the playoffs, which began Friday.“These are little things,” Fabian Broich, Origen’s assistant coach, said. “But they add up, and over the long term you have a more emotionally stable team and a more focused team.”At Rfrsh, Hvidt has assembled a performance team — a physical trainer, a sports psychologist, a massage therapist, a medical doctor and a nutritionist — and constructed a lifestyle plan for the players that combines scientific research, old-school sports wisdom and simple common sense. Broich, 28, a former professional soccer player from Germany, acts as a liaison between the management team and the players, implementing the principles on the ground.The players, who hail from five European countries and range in age from 18 to 24, live in Denmark and fly each weekend to Berlin, where the League of Legends matches are taped in front of a boisterous studio audience. In Copenhagen, they are required to get around by bicycle (a rule they all hated at first) and have fitness and yoga classes during the week. On Mondays, they meet with the team psychologist for an “empty-the-backpack” session.Every morning, the team meets for breakfast in Broich’s apartment, a ritual designed in part to get the gamers — night owls and notoriously late risers — out of bed at a reasonable hour. Their other meals are catered with guidance from the nutritionist.“Before, I would go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. the next day, eat McDonald’s two times, and that’d be it,” Patrik Jiru, 18, an Origen player from the Czech Republic, said as he ate a salmon and vegetable omelet one recent morning.After breakfast, the players biked to the gym for a core workout and a physical therapy session.“Last time we did this, my body was sore for three days,” Jonas Andersen, 24, an Origen player from Denmark known as Kold, said as he grabbed a medicine ball.Mikkel Hjuler, a trainer who works with Danish Olympians, guided the team through some gaming-specific exercises. He had the players wrap their fists inside elastic bands and flex their fingers. He taught them a neck exercise favored by boxers.The players were willing participants, but they admitted that their ambitions, from a physical standpoint, were modest.“I’m O.K. with being chubby as long as I don’t pass out when I’m running — which, right now, I might,” Aguirre said.The players continue to train several hours a day in front of computers, but even those sessions now borrow elements from traditional sports.Before a recent scrimmage session at the Rfrsh headquarters, Broich distributed magnesium pills and protein bars. (He keeps vitamin D and krill oil in his arsenal, too.) Later, he blended a potpourri of nutritional supplements — moringa, matcha, maca, chlorella, açaí and a half-dozen others — into a thick protein shake.In their meeting room, a quotation attributed to the N.B.A. coach Phil Jackson — “The strength of the team is each individual member” — was scribbled on a dry-erase board. After one practice game, the team laid out yoga mats and stretched on foam rollers.Trevor Henry, 31, a broadcast commentator for Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, marveled at how quickly the game’s competitive landscape was professionalizing. He was happy, for instance, that some teams were reconsidering their use of gaming houses, a classic e-sports setup in which players live and train together under one roof.“Go back just a few years: Professional players would play 10 to 11 hours every day and do takeout food every day,” Henry said. “Pizza boxes would stack up rooms. Laundry would never get done. I’ll be brutally honest: Teams didn’t wash the team shirts. They’d have the same team shirt that they’d wear 24 weeks in a year that has never seen detergent.”This lifestyle — part monk, part fraternity brother — was not only accepted but also held up as the very reason the players were successful. But that wisdom is now being challenged, and in Europe the shift by League of Legends this year to a 10-team, franchise model (akin to American sports leagues) has encouraged organizations to make more long-term investments.Last year, Fabien Devide, the chairman of Team Vitality, a French gaming organization, spent seven months embedded in his League of Legends team’s gaming house in Berlin. He was startled by what he saw.“It was a madhouse,” Devide said, describing an atmosphere with an utter lack of boundaries between personal and professional life. “It can become a toxic environment very quick.”Devide said Team Vitality planned to move its players into separate apartments later this year. Acknowledging the pioneering example of Rfrsh, he said he was formalizing plans to open a training center for his organization in Paris and hire a performance director, in the mold of Hvidt, to devise a program grounded in traditional sports ideas.Teams now understand that championships are won and lost in the details. When Origen was assembling its squad last year, Hvidt asked potential signees to complete a personality test with hundreds of questions to make sure it was building an emotionally compatible group.In December, the players convened for a preseason camp with one catch: no computers. Instead, the players spent several days completing trust exercises and discussing their dreams with Lars Robl, a sports psychologist who spent two decades in the Danish special forces — “the real Counter Strike,” he joked — and whose other clients include the Danish soccer club F.C. Midtjylland.Robl’s job now is to help the gamers see themselves as elite athletes, just like the soccer players.“They have the same DNA,” Robl said. “They’re just not aware of it yet.”"
"From a Church in Philadelphia, Sports Reference Informs the World - The New York Times
PHILADELPHIA — While writing a sermon in September, Cheryl Pyrch, the pastor of Summit Presbyterian Church, needed an assist. On the topic of greatness and Jesus Christ, she wanted to open with recollections of greats in other spheres.She didn’t have to look very far for a source.Having encountered Wilt Chamberlain in passing almost 40 years ago, she decided he was the great she wanted to highlight. And details of his career — four Most Valuable Player Awards, seven N.B.A. scoring titles — were close at hand, literally and figuratively through Sports Reference, a monolith of sports data websites that just happens to rent space from the church.“I didn’t know all this in 1980,” Pyrch told the congregation as she described Chamberlain’s awards during the Sunday service. “I got it yesterday from a Sports Reference website.”The ubiquitous Sports Reference family of websites — Baseball-Reference.com, Basketball-Reference.com, Pro-Football-Reference.com, Hockey-Reference.com, and so on — are some of the most popular sports almanacs on the internet.They draw users of all kinds, from people casually searching for a trivia answer to owners of professional teams. Aided by an overhaul of its mobile website, Sports Reference’s founder and president, Sean Forman, said the group of sites drew one billion page views last year, a record for the company.Sports Reference, however, does not have the gleaming offices or huge staff of a digital titan. It has 11 full-time employees and is headquartered on the third floor of a building at Summit Presbyterian in Philadelphia, behind the 100-year-old main church and above the gymnasium, which is often used as a day care center.“Walking through it to come in and out, sometimes you’re going through 3-year-olds tossing balls,” said Mike Kania, 38, who eight years ago became one of the company’s first employees. “I worked for AOL for a long time where we had a badge to scan at the front door, people there and a front desk. It’s a lot different from that.”It is, in fact, a point of pride among Sports Reference employees that the sites have grown from humble beginnings into oft-used resources. Until late last year, Forman, 47, was cleaning the office and taking out the trash. (He has since hired the church’s janitor to take over those duties.)They are among the most popular sports-related sites. Basketball-Reference trails only NBA.com, while Pro-Football-Reference is second to NFL.com, according to SimilarWeb. Nearly two decades after Forman created Baseball-Reference, it ranks third among baseball sites, behind MLB.com and MLBTradeRumors.com. (Baseball-Reference, however, is the top draw in Forman’s stable.)The sites are not just for casual fans. J.J. Redick, the Philadelphia 76ers guard, pays for an advertising-free Basketball-Reference subscription. John Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C., uses Baseball-Reference’s Play Index to manage statistical searches. Scott Boras, the well-known baseball agent, donated $100 to the company during its infancy because he had relied on the site’s data while negotiating a contract for Andruw Jones, Forman said.“I use it daily,” said Thad Levine, the Minnesota Twins general manager, although his team, like many others, generates its own advanced and proprietary data.“We went so far as to hire one of their back-end programmers,” added Levine, referring to Hans Van Slooten, who oversaw Baseball-Reference until June, when the Twins hired him for their front office.The sites are still expanding and developing. Forman said he envisioned Basketball-Reference eventually surpassing Baseball-Reference in traffic as a result of the data revolution in the N.B.A. And over the summer, Sports Reference began another major undertaking: a soccer website, FBref.com, which the company hopes will be as comprehensive as its other sites. In a twist from its current offerings, the company is planning to make the soccer site bilingual, with English and Spanish versions.The sites are painstakingly tweaked for updates and corrections. Some errors are reported through the dozens of emails the company receives daily. One came from the mother of Casey Fossum, a former major league pitcher. She wrote to say that her son’s birth date was wrong. It was corrected.Other requests reveal the reach of Sports Reference.A pitching coach sent an email asking that his Italian league statistics be added to his page so that his players would stop teasing him about being a bad pitcher. A woman wrote in to say that she was dating a person who claimed to be a former N.F.L. player but that she could not find him on Pro-Football-Reference. She wanted to know if that was because of an oversight or a lie.“I tried to let her down as gently as possible,” said Mike Lynch, 37, whose official title with the company is managing stathead. “I said something like, ‘If he was cut in training camp, we wouldn’t necessarily have a record of him playing in a regular season game.’”Sports Reference started with Baseball-Reference in 2000, when Forman, looking to avoid work on his doctoral dissertation on applied mathematical and computational sciences at the University of Iowa, began building a website from the CD-ROM that accompanied the printed Total Baseball encyclopedias. He hoped to make historical data more accessible.Forman, who has contributed to The New York Times’s baseball coverage in the past, expanded his endeavor by creating Sports Reference in 2004. Three years later he formalized loose affiliations with Pro-Football-Reference (founded by Doug Drinen in 2000) and Basketball-Reference (founded by Justin Kubatko in 2004). Kubatko left Sports Reference in 2013 because of what he called “creative differences.”In 2007, Forman still fit the stats nerd stereotype, working out of the basement of his home and staying up until 1 a.m. updating or improving the website. The year before, he had left his full-time job of six years — professor of mathematics and computer science at St. Joseph’s University — because it was too hard to juggle both. He also needed a better place to work.So Forman turned to his church, which had space to rent.Sports Reference’s seven websites are usually updated automatically, mostly from official feeds of statistics that the company pays for. Some data, such as roster transactions or salary information, is input manually, and there are always bugs to fix.Once you get beyond the basics, however, the information on the sites runs the gamut of sources.They include a collection of old college media guides acquired from a single collector and a professor in Britain who supplies statistics of independent baseball leagues. The sites also add some things just for fun, such as Oddibe McDowell’s page listing his utility bills from 2011 and part of 2012, in reference to a series of articles by Deadspin.Sports Reference’s goal is to become more comprehensive, even as sports leagues increasingly privatize their data. Eventually, the company hopes to charge for advanced features and to become less dependent on advertising, which currently generates 95 percent of the sites’ revenue. As of now, the only advanced tool that requires a paid subscription is Baseball-Reference’s Play Index. (Don’t worry: The page for the former Met Keith Hernandez’s mustache will live forever.)That the little company in her church has become so important, with leading sports websites, earned a laugh from Pyrch. She had been to the sites once or twice, including the time she did sermon research.“I think that both myself and most of the congregation would not realize what kind of a powerhouse Sports Reference is,” she said. “I don’t really know a lot about numbers or computers, but one billion is a lot.”"
"Playing to Win: Using Sports to Develop Evidence-Based Arguments - The New York Times
Sports is not just about X’s and O’s or wins and losses; it’s also about ethics and economics, race and gender, science and technology, joy and camaraderie, and nearly everything in between. Sports allows us to admire the awesomeness of the human body and the artistry of athletes in action, and to explore stories of grit and resilience and our need for heroes and villains.While it might not be immediately obvious to all teachers, particularly those who aren’t die-hard fans, sports is also an endless source of inspiration for making arguments and throwing down facts.In this lesson, we explore how to use the world of sports to help students effectively develop evidence-based arguments. We suggest three categories for practicing the skill in sports contexts — from making a case for the G.O.A.T. to taking on current sports-world controversies to proposing rule changes to make a sport or tournament better. We end the lesson with a few strategies for bringing debate and argument writing alive in the classroom.Do you teach with sports reporting? We’d love to hear your ideas. Post a comment or write to LNFeedback@nytimes.com._________Who is the G.O.A.T.?No, not those cute animals with the horns and the beard. The Greatest of All Time.No matter how seemingly impossible it is to determine the G.O.A.T., it is a perennial favorite argument for sports fans and is debated regularly in The New York Times.The G.O.A.T. argument comes in many forms: Best Game, Best Season, Best Coach, Best Team, Greatest Upset, Greatest Olympian. Even best and worst sports cities.But how do you decide: Is it the accomplishments on the playing field or is it a player’s greater impact beyond his or her sport? How do you compare one era to another?Is Tom Brady the greatest football player of all time? Who would you pick, Michael Jordan or LeBron James? Is Serena Williams the greatest athlete of all time? Or is it Muhammad Ali?Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the Munich Olympics in 1936, broke or equaled nine Olympic records, also set three world records and single-handedly shattered Adolf Hitler’s myth of Aryan superiority; yet his record mark of 10.3 seconds in the 100 meters would today be 21 feet behind Usain Bolt’s record of 9.58. Would it be more fair to incorporate broader cultural accomplishments? Or should the Greatest of All Time focus solely on the numbers?Student Challenge: Make your case for the G.O.A.T.First, ask your students to decide which aspect of the G.O.A.T. debate they would like to tackle: greatest play, season, game, coach, athlete, et cetera.Next, they should define their criteria for greatness: Does greatest mean the player you want to be up at bat in the seventh game of the World Series, two outs in the bottom of the ninth? Is it instead the number of an athlete’s victories? His or her longevity? The relative strength of the competition? The athlete’s impact within, as well as beyond, the sport?Advance Evidence-Based Arguments and Tackle Counterarguments Use a model text or two to help students move from mere assertion or opinion to rigorous, evidence-based argument. Here are a few excerpts to highlight how authors both support claims with evidence and anticipate counterarguments:In “Is Russell Westbrook’s Season the Best Ever? Some Apples and Oranges to Pick From,” Jeré Longman supports his claims with evidence using sports statistics:In “It’s Time to Appreciate Serena Williams’s Greatness,” Christopher Clarey anticipates counterarguments:Together, the class might analyze how these authors develop their case for G.O.A.T., for example, by defining their terms for greatness, providing evidence to support claims and anticipating and then considering potential counterclaims.Here are additional resources, from The Times, and elsewhere, that can provide alternative mentor texts:The Fine Line: What Makes Simone Biles the World’s Best Gymnast Eliud Kipchoge Is the Greatest Marathoner, Ever On Team of All-Time Greats, Pelé Shines Brightest Golden State Warriors Are Closing In on History Lindsey Vonn to Retire: Vonn Leaves as the Greatest Women’s Skier in History G.O.A.T.

To some, Jesse Owens will always be the G.O.A.T. for his cultural impact; for others, Bill Russell’s 11 N.B.A. championships will trump all other measures. But that is the beauty of the debate. And in the end, it’s about the power of the argument to persuade others — at least for that day — who is the Greatest of All Time._________Should athletes who use steroids be barred from professional sports? Should players have the right to kneel during the national anthem? Should college athletes be paid?These are just a few of the countless debates that come and go in the world of sports. Any one of them is ripe for students to investigate and debate to practice their inquiry and argument skills.In this section we present three sports-related case studies to demonstrate how students can develop good research questions, assert a strong claim and study mentor texts as a way to improve their debate writing and speaking skills. And these three topics are just the tip of the iceberg; at the end of the section, we suggest another 11 current issues in sports for students to explore. And we’re confident your students would have plenty more topics to add to our list.Case Study #1. Sports and ConcussionsSports are often associated with heroism — endurance, toughness, and valor. It has long been assumed that an athlete will have to make physical sacrifices to achieve greatness. But the sacrifice is now being questioned because of changes in our understanding of the impact sports can have on our bodies and minds.The brain trauma sustained in football and other contact sports is now linked to long-term cognitive impairment, including memory loss, confusion, depression and dementia. Although media coverage of concussions has focused on tackle football, these health issues are evident in many other sports like hockey, soccer, basketball, Nascar, skiing, snowboarding and BMX freestyle, among others.The debate is not merely academic; it is causing significant changes to our understanding of athletes and athletics and is threatening the future viability of some of the world’s most popular sports.Develop Winning QuestionsResearch generally begins with asking good questions. Even a topic as seemingly straight forward as sports-related concussions has many layers of complexity. So students should begin their research by asking themselves: What about this topic interests me most? What do I want to learn more about?For example, if they want to start with the science, they might generate questions like: What is the impact of a single concussion? What is the long-term impact of brain trauma? What is the degenerative brain disease C.T.E.? And what is the impact of concussions on youths?Or they may instead decide to investigate the role equipment plays, look into possible reforms or consider ethical implications. If they decide to go in any of these directions, they might come up with questions like: How do concussions affect athletes’ short- and long-term physical and mental health? How does this affect the people around them? What is the role of equipment in brain trauma? Can equipment reduce concussions or does it give players a false sense of security, therefore making the problem worse? Should parents let their children play football? Or are we obsessing about the dangers? Should we as fans still watch football?No matter what question or questions students start with, research inevitably leads to asking more questions.Some other relevant resources: 110 N.F.L. Brains. All But One Had C.T.E. A Football Player’s Descent Into Pain and Paranoia Anatomy of a Traditional Football Helmet Concussions Can Occur in All Youth SportsCanadian Football’s Big Steps to Reduce Hits, a Contrast to the N.F.L.Case Study #2. National Anthem ProtestsPolitical activism and protests by athletes are nothing new. Muhammad Ali publicly criticized the Vietnam War. John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised fists during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics. Following the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the other members of the Miami Heat posted a photo of themselves wearing hooded sweatshirts in his memory. But perhaps no act of political protest today is more polarizing than the stance by Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem at N.F.L. games.If students want to argue a position related to recent national anthem protests, they should start by asking a question. For example, should athletes have the right to kneel during the national anthem? Or are athletes who protest being patriotic or unpatriotic? As students do research, they will gather evidence that will support a position. Once they find enough compelling evidence, they are ready to assert a claim (or thesis or resolution).Assert a Claim In small groups or as a whole class, students can debate one or more claims that were generated by students — or the teacher. After they have the opportunity to test their arguments with their peers and hear other points of view, they can write up their argument as an essay or editorial.Below are a few possible resolutions that students can affirm or negate, with related articles below.Resolution 1: The N.F.L. has the right to demand that its players stand during the national anthem.Surprise! The N.F.L. National Anthem Problem Is Not Going Away. N.F.L. Anthem Policy Bound to Please Only the N.F.L. Trump Supports N.F.L.’s New National Anthem Policy Dolphins Policy Says Players Could Be Suspended for Anthem ProtestsResolution 2: Colin Kaepernick is a hero.Why Kaepernick Takes the Knee This Time, Colin Kaepernick Takes a Stand by Kneeling The Awakening of Colin Kaepernick The Deafening Silence of Colin Kaepernick Colin Kaepernick’s Nike Campaign Keeps N.F.L. Anthem Kneeling in SpotlightResolution 3: Schools have the right to suspend student-athletes who protest during their games.Protest Started by Colin Kaepernick Spreads to High School Students High School Students Explain Why They Protest Anthems and Pledges High Schools Threaten to Punish Students Who Kneel During Anthem High School Students Kicked Off Football Team After Protesting During National AnthemResolution 4: Athletes who are politically active are a distraction to their teams and should stick to competing in their sport.In 2017, Many Athletes Found Their Voices Should Athletes Stick to Sports? Colin Kaepernick and the Myth of the ‘Good’ ProtestCase Study #3. Performance-Enhancing DrugsCheating has always existed in sports: spitballs in baseball; weighted gloves in boxing; stealing another team’s signs. Players are always looking for an edge, but perhaps none is more contentious and troubling than the edge that performance-enhancing drugs provide — steroids, human growth hormone, blood doping.Some of sports’ most celebrated athletes have been caught using PEDs: for example, the cyclist Lance Armstrong, the gold-medal runner Marion Jones, the tennis champion Maria Sharapova and the Ultimate Fighting Championship star Jon Jones. In 2018, the entire Russian Winter Olympic team was barred from competing for doping violations.Let’s say students have already generated their research questions related to the topic of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, they have done initial research, and they have asserted a claim they plan to defend in writing. What else can they do before they start typing to get an edge?Study the ProsAnalyzing mentor texts can help students identify how writers build arguments using claims, reasons and supporting details, and they can help students see how to develop effective counterarguments as well.Here are excerpts from two Opinion essays offering opposing viewpoints to the question: Should known steroid users be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame?In “Keep Rose, Bond and Clemens Out of the Baseball Hall of Fame,” Bijan C. Bayne makes the case for why Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, two statistical heavyweights in the sport, should not be inducted into the Hall of Fame:Zev Chafets argues the other side in “Let Steroids Into the Hall of Fame”:After reading these different points of view, students can brainstorm a list of strengths and weaknesses in each article and in each writer’s argument. Which argument is more effective? Convincing? Memorable? What elements are fact versus opinion? When is opinion most appropriate in an argument? Are there any aspects of either article that seem weak? Why? What might make these arguments stronger?Together, the class can create a list of dos and don’ts for building an argument. For example, “DO: support your ideas with relevant statistics.” Or, “DON’T: assume your reader will agree with your viewpoint.”For students researching this topic, here are just a few of the many related resources in The Times and elsewhere:Some other relevant resourcesShould Doping Be Allowed?

Here is an additional list of 11 questions. And of course, students can suggest their own topics.Should Every Young Athlete Get a Trophy? Should Character Matter in Pro Sports? Is It Wrong to Let Children Do Extreme Sports? Should College Athletes Be Paid? Should Gambling on Sporting Events Be Legal? Should Male and Female Athletes Be Paid the Same? Is Technology Helping or Hurting Sports? Is the 3-Point Basket Ruining Basketball? Should Animal Sports (Horse Racing, Rodeos, Bullfighting, etc.) Be Banned? Are Advanced Statistics Helping or Hurting Sports? Should Offensive Team Names and Mascots Be Ended?_________Asking students to question the status quo in the world of sports doesn’t only help them strengthen their argument writing and speaking skills, but it can also strengthen their creative thinking and problem-solving skills.A. Propose a New Sport for the OlympicsWe have all played or watched sports. But what exactly is a sport?What is the difference between a sport and a hobby? Is fishing a sport? How about poker? What about E-sports? Should the top players of League of Legends be considered athletes? And if so, would they be in the same class as LeBron James?How about chess?Don’t answer too quickly; chess is recognized as a sport in 107 countries. Poker is broadcast on ESPN.Define Your TermsAn essential aspect of making an effective argument is the need to be clear and precise in defining terms. We discussed earlier about how one defines G.O.A.T. frames the entire “greatest of all time” debate. The same can be said for defining terms like “performance-enhancing drugs” in the debate about steroids or “patriotic” in the discussion about national anthem protests. When it comes to deciding what should or should not be considered a sport, or an Olympic sport, defining the term “sport” is essential.Students might begin by reading the following articles and then designing their own criteria for what is or isn’t a sport:Are Video Games a Sport Born on Sideline, Cheering Clamors to Be Sport Competitive Bridge Is Not a Sport, a British Court RulesStudent Challenge: Make a formal argument to the International Olympic Committee to add or delete a sport.The fight over which sports get to be featured in the Olympics sheds light on the continuing societal question, “What is a sport?” Currently, there are 28 summer and 15 winter Olympic sports. (See the full list of sports here.) Did you know life saving is  officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee as a sport (though, as Victor Mather writes, “that doesn’t mean it will take its place in the Summer Games alongside venerable sports like track, basketball and synchronized swimming”).Students can begin their research with the following examples:Are Video Games Olympic Material? Some Boosters Say Yes The Olympics Would Be Better With a Breakdancing Competition. Discuss. Great Moments in Cheerleading: Could the Olympics Be Next? Too Many Olympic Events, or Not Enough?Next, students should pick one Olympic sport to add or delete. They should then prepare an argument to support this proposal.In making their case, students should compare the sports they are proposing to existing Olympic sports, and provide criteria for assessing those comparisons.In his Room for Debate opinion essay “Drop the Sliding Sports,” Robert K. Barney writes:B. Propose a Rule ChangeRules are essential for any game or sport, yet they change all the time. How basketball is played can vary greatly from state to state. Every few years, it seems, the National Football League changes what qualifies as a catch and a legal tackle, alternately confusing and infuriating players and fans alike.Student Challenge: Propose a rule change to improve the game.For inspiration, students might read some of these proposed changes — big and small, practical as well as fantastical — from the pages of The Times before making a pitch for their own rule changes.Baseball’s Too Slow. Here’s How You Fix It. Penalty-Kick Shootouts Are a World Cup Abomination In a Hole, Golf Considers Digging a Wider One Still Questioning the Best-of-Five Format in Men’s Tennis Drivers, Start Your Calculators: Nascar Introduces New Scoring System Room for Debate: Raise the RimConsider the Proposal From All SidesWhether you want to raise the basketball rim by six inches or triple the size of a golf hole, you’ll need to consider how the change would affect the sport from all angles. In guiding their research for the development of their proposal, students should keep in mind the following questions:• What are some weaknesses of the current game? (e.g., amount of scoring, length or speed of the game, popularity, and ratings)• What are the causes of the weakness? (e.g., tradition, the age of the fan base, technology)• What are some possible solutions?• How hard would it be to put the rule change in place?• What might be the drawbacks or unintended consequences of your game change?• How might purists or other critics respond to your rule change? How might you try to persuade them to join your side?In “Penalty-Kick Shootouts Are a World Cup Abomination,” Rob Hughes passionately states a perceived problem in the current game of soccer:Later, Mr. Hughes considers some solutions to the problem:No matter what rule they focus on, students should be clear to state the problem with the status quo and support their claim with details. Then they should propose a solution and explain why it would help to eliminate, or at least improve, the problem with the current rule._________Below, we provide a few possible ways students can build their argument writing and speaking skills and demonstrate those skills in front of an audience:A. Write an EditorialHave your students pick a sports-related issue that matters to them, such as inequity in pay for female athletes, and then write an evidence-based persuasive essay like the editorials The New York Times publishes every day. They can practice all year, but save their best work to submit in our annual Student Editorial Contest. (See our contest calendar for more details.) Each year we select 10 winners along with dozens of runners-up and honorable mentions from thousands of submissions.Here are some sports-related editorials from the New York Times Editorial Board that can serve as mentor texts (in addition to our winning editorials from past years):The Corruption at the Heart of March MadnessRein In Online Fantasy Sports Gambling What Time Is the A.F.C.

Have a DebateThere are many ways to hold formal and informal debates. Here are a few popular formats:Lincoln-Douglas Debate: In this formal debate format, arguments are divided into timed segments and go back and forth between the “pro” and the “con” sides, with teams presenting arguments, providing evidence to support arguments and offering rebuttals. See our 2004 lesson Weighing the War for more details about this format.Roundtable Discussion: Students take on the role of experts and engage in a talk show-style debate similar to the discussion format on such TV shows as “Meet the Press.”Tournament Brackets: Students hold a research- and debate-based “tournament” to determine the “winners” of each round, until a final winner is declared.Structured Academic Controversy: Pairs assigned to each position research and then present their argument to a pair that is assigned the opposing side. The debate follows these steps: Identify the argument; present the argument; restate the argument; discuss opinions; share conclusions; debrief the exercise. See our lesson On ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’: Debating a Proposed Repeal for more details about this format.Moving Debate: After preparing for a debate on an assigned topic, students are arranged in the room in three sections: agree, disagree and neutral/unsure. The debate proceeds with “members” of each section taking turns to make arguments for their position and ask questions of others. As they are beginning to question, refine or change their positions (even momentarily so), they physically move to the sections of the room that reflect their mind-set. See the civics section of our lesson Preserve, Protect and Defend? Considering Violent Protests and American Values for more details about this format.Other resourcesConstructing Arguments: ‘Room for Debate’ and the Common Core Standards Reader Idea | Using Room for Debate to Teach Argumentative Writing and Discussion Skills Winners of Our Student Contest Featured in a Special Room for Debate Post Reader Idea | Debates on Persuasive Language That Extend Outside of ClassC.

Has Baseball Lost Its Cool? Should Women’s Basketball Lower the Rims? Is It Offensive for Sports Teams to Use Native American Names and Mascots? Should Technology in Sports Be Limited?D. Create A Public Service AnnouncementThere are many ways to present an argument; while many of our previous examples focus on writing and speaking, visual thinking is also important. Public service announcements can be both fun and a challenging way for students to take a stance on an issue and to creatively persuade audiences.Students can begin with traditional forms of research and then identify an issue or stance they want to take before envisioning their P.S.A. They can then plan, storyboard, rehearse, record and edit a 30- or 60-second video including a tagline and message.To start, students should view and analyze professional sports public service announcements to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the form. You can use these professional PSAs as models:Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality NFL Players & Coaches Stand Together to Cure ALS NFL Players’ Concussion PSA: Be Man Enough to Admit When You’re Hurt PSA Youth Concussions UEFA’s Anti-racism Resolution Thierry Henry Stand UP, Speak UP CommercialAs a class, analyze and discuss: What is a public service announcement? How is it different from a commercial? What is the message of the P.S.A.? Who is the target audience? What video and audio elements were used? How did these elements strengthen the message? How effective was the P.S.A.? How might you improve it?After identifying their issue or question and conducting research, students can begin planning their public service announcement.Here are some process steps to consider:• Determine a clear message. • Identify a target audience. • Develop a tagline or slogan. • Brainstorm video (stills, graphics, performers) and audio (narration, voice-over, music, sound effects) elements you will use to convey your message. • Storyboard your PSA. • Rehearse. • Record. • Edit._________Do you teach with sports reporting?

"For the Wealthy, Sports Opened a Back Door to Elite Colleges - The New York Times
The corruptions of American college sports and the status anxieties of the wealthy have achieved a spectacular commingling, as a federal indictment on Tuesday charged that N.C.A.A. coaches were paid to fix admissions for rich children at elite colleges and universities, like Georgetown, Yale and U.S.C.An entrepreneur devised this ingenious scam less than a decade ago, and it involved multiple fixes, a sort of corruption minuet. Parents with cash to burn could pay to have a test taker sit in on the SAT or ACT in place of their teenagers. And if their children’s grades too were not up to snuff, they could bribe coaches to accept them as fake tennis, soccer and water polo prodigies.The entry price for bribes often ran toward figures that meant this was no scheme for hoi polloi tennis dads. The bribe paying parents were weighted toward well-known actors, financiers and high-end designers. The ringleaders offered an additional service: If parents paid yet more money they could make children believe their test scores were real.[Read more about the actresses, business leaders and other wealthy parents charged in the college admissions scandal.] So the Henriquez family (Manuel, the father, is chairman and chief executive of a publicly traded finance company) conspired to fix their daughter’s SAT, according to federal documents specifying the charges. Then, as the family had its gaze fixed on Georgetown University, they conspired with Gordon Ernst, the school’s tennis coach, to palm off their daughter as a tennis player.She was helped to put together an application that was long on tales of struggle. I’ve played all summer. I grind out three and four hour a day workouts. I have a top 50 ranking in the USTA Junior Girls Tennis, and I’m looking forward to being part of the team and so on and on, and all of it was fabricated. At the end, the college coach simply told the admissions office: “Potential spot.”Over the following year, the Henriquez Family Trust donated $400,000 to a foundation that in turn paid Ernst $950,000 for handling the Henriquez daughter and several other faux tennis recruits.This is splendid work if your olfactory senses are not troubled by the stench of corruption.This scandal has had the salutary effect too of exploding what remains of upper middle class and wealthy self-righteousness about the grubby ways of the college sports in the basketball and football divisions. A year and a half back, F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors arrested assistant coaches and sneaker company fixers and pointed the finger at A.A.U. coaches and coaches who made payments to star players.This, we were told, was unacceptable, a corruption that must be stamped out.Unacceptable in this context meant, I suppose, a working class family and their son accepting $55,000 from an assistant coach at a large university that stands to make millions of dollars marketing their son while legally paying him nothing.The wealthy already engage in much so-called acceptable board-tilting. Rich families routinely make contributions of millions of dollars to elite colleges in hopes of ensuring that admissions offices welcomed their children’s applications. More recently, as this scandal makes clear, families tried to ensure that their sons and daughters would be psychologically evaluated in such a way that allowed them to receive many extra hours to complete high pressure admissions tests to high school and college. It was the genius of this scandal’s mastermind that he found a way to combine that dodge with a subterfuge that allowed ringers to actually take those tests.“Most of these kids don’t even have issues, but they’re getting time,” the ringleader explained to a parent. “The playing field is not fair.”The F.B.I. transcript revealed no parent who protested this accounting. Let’s read the transcript as Gordon R. Caplan, co-chairman of the top law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, talks of fixing his teenager’s test scores.“It’s just, to be honest, I’m not worried about the moral issue here,” he said.This scandal is intriguing for a final reason. There is much gnashing and grinding of teeth these days over admission to elite schools, ranging from preferential admissions for black and Latino students to whether Asian-American students constitute a too large part of the student body.This scandal reminds us that well-to-do families have long known of a back door. As the writer Saahil Desai pointed out in a fine piece for Atlantic Magazine last autumn, sports at elite colleges, from sailing to golf, tennis to lacrosse, are disproportionately filled with the children of the white wealthy. Many of these sports require that families spend upward of $1,000 per month during high school. Some 65 percent of the Ivy League athletes are white, and as the writer noted, this already constitutes a “quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids.”These particular corrupt families used these doors to illegally gain entry for their well-privileged children. That is wrong, but it points to another way in which even well meaning wealthy parents can game the system.“These parents are a catalog of wealth and privilege,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said Tuesday. “This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions.”For once, he might have added, the coaches are but corrupt handmaids."

"Christchurch Hosts 1st Big Sports Event Since Mosque Attacks - The New York Times
CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — More than 10,000 people attended a National Rugby League match between Manly and the New Zealand Warriors on Saturday in the first major sports event which Christchurch has hosted since the March 15 shootings at two mosques left 50 dead.The game was scheduled as a home match for the Sydney-based Manly Sea Eagles before the shootings which rocked usually peaceful New Zealand. On Saturday it became another rallying point for a healing community.A moment's silence was observed for victims of the shooting during which players and match officials huddled in the center of Christchurch Stadium. The teams wore jerseys emblazoned with the hashtag #theyareus, referencing a statement made by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately after the shootings.Ardern said Muslims who were targeted in the shootings are an intrinsic part of New Zealand society.Warriors chief executive Cameron George said the Warriors would wear the hashtag for the remainder of the 2019 season.""Like everyone, we were devastated with what happened a fortnight ago and we wanted to come up with a way to honor those who lost their lives,"" George said, with the club ""determined to do something lasting and meaningful.""Manly won the match 46-12.____"
"Opinion | Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports - The New York Times
When the Duke University basketball star Zion Williamson injured his knee in a freak accident in a game on Wednesday, it reignited a debate over whether student-athletes competing as amateurs on college campuses should instead become paid professionals. If Williamson and other elite players like him are going to risk their professional futures by playing college sports, many wonder, shouldn’t they be financially compensated?Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn’t afford. The 30 largest universities in the country each routinely generate annual revenues exceeding $100 million from sports, but according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, most of those revenues are spent covering operating expenses for the school’s athletic programs and paying tuition for their student-athletes. The majority of Division I colleges in the N.C.A.A. operate at a loss. In fact, among the roughly 350 athletic departments in the N.C.A.A.’s Division I, only about 24 schools have generated more revenue than expenses in recent years. The nation’s top five conferences made over $6 billion in 2015, billions more than all other schools combined, according to an ESPN analysis of N.C.A.A. data.For the have-not universities, however, to continue operating means relying on millions of dollars in debt, funding from their main campus and student fees. Even with that help, some of the major athletic departments are struggling. A recent N.C.A.A. study determined that only about 20 of the 1,000 or so college sports programs in the nation were profitable. What is going to happen when the competition to offer students money is supercharged?A federal judge in Northern California, Claudia Wilken, will soon decide if student-athletes should instead be paid more like professionals. At the moment, thanks in part to the pressure exerted by a 2015 ruling by Judge Wilken, top N.C.A.A. athletes can receive scholarships totaling tens of thousands of dollars for tuition, room, board and stipends, as well as cost-of-attendance compensation. But the association still sets a ceiling on those benefits, and a group of Division I basketball and football players is awaiting Judge Wilken’s ruling on whether that ceiling should effectively be lifted.If the plaintiffs in this case are successful, the arms race for top athletes may have no limit. The top 25 or so schools will pay because they can afford to. The remaining 325 or so will be forced to make a decision: not pay their athletes (and risk losing top talent to schools that do) or find a way to pay.We have already had a preview of what happens when schools are put in this position. In August 2015, after the N.C.A.A. began allowing Division I universities to adopt “cost of attendance” stipends, North Dakota State University announced that it would offer such stipends in 16 sports, resulting in a new $600,000 annual expense to be paid by the athletic department. The school’s rival, the University of North Dakota, followed suit six days later. What happened? The University of North Dakota cut five teams over the next two years to help pay for the added expense.The University of Wyoming, too, announced that it would offer stipends to its student-athletes in 2015, resulting in a new expected annual cost of $700,000 to the athletic department. A year later, calls were being made for a reduction in the athletic department because of budgetary concerns. (Those cuts almost certainly would have been made, had it not been for a $4 million subsidy from the state government.)Gene Smith, the athletic director at Ohio State University, has said that if the N.C.A.A. pay ceiling were lifted and he were pushed to pay basketball and football student-athletes more than their full-ride scholarship packages, he would not expect to maintain the same number of sports. The chancellor at the University of Wisconsin, Rebecca Blank, has also said that her school would consider cutting sports programs altogether.Forcing the N.C.A.A. to pay student-athletes would undermine opportunities for the vast majority of them. It would create a winner-take-all system in which only a handful of top recruits would get a paycheck on top of earning a diploma debt-free.Similar problems would arise in the case of so-called third-party payments, in which student-athletes could be paid for things like endorsements. Major brands like Nike would pay top football and basketball talent at the biggest schools, while student-athletes in other sports or at smaller programs would be ignored. Currently, corporate funds go to athletic departments and are generally distributed among all sports; with third-party payments, those funds could instead mostly go directly to a few student-athletes, starving the rest.I am not opposed to young athletes who decide they would prefer to be paid cash to play sports. For those who think that a free education is insufficient as compensation for playing sports, there are other options: The National Basketball Association’s developmental league, for instance, offers $125,000 contracts to top high-school talent. Such athletes can also pursue a career playing for other domestic or overseas professional leagues.Millions of student-athletes devote their sweat, blood and tears to sports. Some play football and basketball; others swim, run cross-country, play soccer or compete as gymnasts. Only a fraction of them generate money for their schools. We must ensure that the N.C.A.A. is able to preserve its commitment to all of them."
"Besides the Mets, Other Astonishing Sports Runs - The New York Times
The 1969 Mets are regularly prefixed with the alliterative nickname Miracle.But that doesn’t mean their unlikely World Series championship was the only astonishing run in sporting history. Plenty of other teams and athletes have defied the odds and the prognosticators to roar to unlikely triumph.In paying tribute to them, we’ll pass over the underdogs who were most known for beating the unbeatable: Rulon Gardner stunning Alexander Karelin, the United States Olympic hockey team topping the Soviets, Buster Douglas knocking out Mike Tyson, the aptly named Upset dealing Man o’ War his only loss.Instead, we’ll look at the teams and athletes who came out of nowhere, the longest of the long shots. The Miracles.Before the Miracle Mets of Shea Stadium, there were the Miracle Braves of Fenway Park in Boston. And their stories were uncannily similar.Two years before, like the Mets, the Boston Braves were awful, going 52-101. Again, like the Mets, they improved some the next year, to 69-82. And in their shocking championship year they were 94-59 for an unexpected .614 winning percentage. The Mets were .617. Finally, like the Mets, they won the World Series.In one way, their miracle outdid the Mets. By July 4, the Mets had established themselves at least as a decent team; they were 42-34, eight games out in the National League East.Not the Braves. By July 4, 1914, they were 26-38, eighth out of eight in the National League. Somehow, they went 68-21 the rest of the way, a mind-boggling .764 clip, and won the league by 10½ games. Then they swept the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series.In the pre-Ruthian era, the Braves were led by nine homers from Joe Connolly, and the good eye of 32-year-old Johnny Evers, of Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance fame, in his first year away from the Cubs.The New York Times said: The “makeshift team, compactly welded together with a unity of purpose and a perfect harmony of action, had triumphed over one of the greatest ball clubs the game has known.”Before the men’s 10,000 meters at the 1964 Olympics, the world-record holder Ron Clarke of Australia and the defending champion Pyotr Bolotnikov of the Soviet Union were attracting attention. Not attracting attention was Billy Mills of the United States. In the days before the race, no reporter asked him a single question, according to the Olympic historian David Wallechinsky.But with a lap to go, Mills was right there. The leaders had to wind their way through a mass of lapped runners. Clarke, finding himself boxed in, shoved Mills out of the way. Then the Tunisian Mohamed Gammoudi pushed through as well. Mills looked to be running for a bronze. The announcer Bud Palmer speculated about an American record. No one was thinking gold.But then Mills came tearing up on the outside. He passed Clarke. He closed on Gammoudi. “Look at Mills! Look at Mills!” hollered the color man, Dick Bank. (Bank later said he was fired by NBC for that outburst, which they considered unprofessional.)Mills won in 28 minutes 24.4 seconds. He had never run under 29 minutes before. An official of the Tokyo Games approached him after the win to ask, “Who are you?”The Times wrote: “Mills, who is part Sioux Indian and 100 percent American Marine, won a race that no one except himself and Mrs. Mills, who was in the stands, thought he had a chance to win.”Many cite Boris Becker, who won Wimbledon as an unseeded 17-year-old in 1985, as the most unlikely Grand Slam champion. But not everyone was taken by surprise by his win. After Becker defeated Hank Pfister in a first-round match, Pfister said: “There are 124 other guys in the draw I’d rather play. He’s got to be among the top four or five in the world right now.”For a tennis long shot, consider Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion. Her previous best Grand Slam performance, in seven attempts, was the third round. She was ranked 47th coming into the tournament. But she benefited from some lucky breaks in the draw, not meeting a seeded player better than No. 11 until the final, where she upended third-seeded Simona Halep to win the title.Even more extreme was Mark Edmondson, who won the 1976 Australian Open as the 212th best player in the world. With the caveat that in that era many non-Australians skipped the event, Edmondson did beat the players seeded No. 5, No. 12 and No. 13 on his way to the semifinals, then topped No. 1 Ken Rosewall and No. 2 John Newcombe to win it all.Edmondson had played in two previous Grand Slams, making the first and second round. Just a few weeks before the tournament he was mopping floors at a hospital to make ends meet.“No way will something like that happen again,” Bud Collins, the journalist and TV commentator, said in 2011.The Times said (Associated Press article on Edmondson): “One of the greatest upsets in tennis history.”Villanova in 1985 was the lowest-seeded team to win the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. From its No. 8 spot, it knocked off top-seeded Michigan and second-seeded North Carolina on the way to the Final Four, then beat another No. 2-seeded team, Memphis State.The final, against No. 1 Georgetown, was the last N.C.A.A. tournament game played without a shot clock. Villanova took advantage, choosing its shots with care. In the end, it shot a remarkable 22 for 28 and a mind-boggling 9 for 10 in the second half.It was a good decade for N.C.A.A. underdogs: Clemson in 1981 and Miami in 1983 each started the football season unranked and ended it as national champion.The Times said: “In what will surely be remembered as one of the most improbable outcomes in the history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, the Wildcats, who failed to finish in the nation’s Top 20 in any poll this season, completed their emotion-filled postseason by playing the elusive ‘perfect game’ at the perfect time.”John Daly was a big hitter, but seemed to offer little else as a golfer. He wasn’t even going to play in the P.G.A. Championship in 1991, but sneaked into the field as the ninth alternate when others dropped out. As a result of the late entry, he drove all night from Memphis to Carmel, Ind., and teed off without a practice round.He then barreled his way around the course for a three-stroke victory, launching him to a popularity that he maintains today, more than 25 years later.“I think everybody thinks of this as a Cinderella story,” he said. “I think the fans won this tournament for me. I really do.”The Times said: “Playing with a fearless ease that bespoke destiny, a 25-year-old rookie golfer named John Daly completed an underdog story of Rocky-like proportions today.”Where else to find long shots but at the racetrack? The biggest longest shot to win the Kentucky Derby was Donerail in 1913 at odds of 91-1. But that is topped by the Breeders’ Cup Classic winner of 1993.Arcangues had raced around Britain and France without winning anything major. And all his races had been on grass. The Classic is on dirt, and regularly features the very best dirt horses in the world. So it was no surprise that Arcangues went off at odds — 133-1 — that made Donerail look like a comparative sure thing.But Arcangues ran down the speedy Bertrando, winner of several important dirt races in the United States, and won, prompting race caller Tom Durkin to say, “Here is Arcangues to win it, in an absolute shocker!”The Times said: “Arcangues’s winning payoff of $269.20 for $2 was the biggest in the 10-year history of the Breeders’ Cup. His price was so high that his actual odds did not even fit into the infield tote board, which only goes as high as 99-1.”The St. Louis Rams won seven games in 1995. Then six games the following season, then five, then four. Going into the 1999 season the trend line did not look good.When quarterback Trent Green tore up his knee in the preseason, the Rams turned to someone named Kurt Warner, who was undrafted out of Northern Iowa and whose main professional experience was with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of N.F.L. Europe.So no surprise that the bookmakers had the Rams at 300-1 to win it all.Warner proceeded to lead the team to a 13-3 regular-season record, which earned him the league’s Most Valuable Player Award. The Rams then beat the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl, and Warner won another M.V.P. award.The Times said (in a Week 1 preview): “Kurt Warner makes his first N.F.L. start. It won’t be a memorable one.” (Warner beat the Ravens with 309 passing yards and 3 touchdowns.)All these stories are amazing. But this one is just a little more amazing than the others. The modern English Premier League is essentially a closed shop. The big teams not only take first place every year, they take second, third and fourth as well.So no one blinked when Leicester, 14th the previous year, was listed at 5,000 to 1 to lift the league trophy. Heck, why not a million to one? For a team that was hoping to avoid relegation, winning the title seemed impossible.But behind the smart midfield leadership of N’Golo Kante and Riyad Mahrez and the goals of Jamie Vardy, who had been discovered playing in England’s fifth division, Leicester won some games. And then some more. Much credit was given to the unconventional management style of Claudio Ranieri, and his nonsensical catch phrase, “Dilly-ding, dilly-dong.”Leicester ended up not just winning the Premier League, but winning it by an improbable 10-point margin, leaving Arsenal, Tottenham and the Manchester teams far behind.The Times said: “Soccer-crazed, working-class Leicester is verging on one of those ridiculous seasons, an unimaginable championship that was given worse betting odds at the start than finding Elvis alive.”Miraculous."
"The Little Sports Jacket That Could - The New York Times
Is there a medical insurance code yet for street-style whiplash? Everyone in Florence, Italy, develops it at some point, a chronic neck ache caused by abruptly swiveling your head to get a load of some Instagram apparition in dandy drag.The complaint is particularly acute during Pitti Uomo, the twice yearly trade fair that is to men’s wear what Coachella is to indie bands. Style mobs from all over the planet descend on this Renaissance city, trunks crammed with looks used to bait the style paparazzi who also arrive in hordes.Part spectacle, part farce, these so-called influencers have become so essential an element of the theater of fashion that without them the giddy atmospherics of most fashion weeks might burn off like industrial gas flare. What we’d be left with would be the reality that these trade fairs are no more intrinsically interesting than a boat or auto show.Yet here is a notion out of left field: Maybe it is time to tune out social media. Perhaps by filtering some of the seductive static produced for online consumption by guys wearing plus-four trousers or spats or capes or waxed mustaches or deerstalker caps, we can refocus on things no less radical for being subtle and discreet.Consider L.B.M. 1911, for instance. Fashion insiders are sure to know this family-owned label, produced by a firm founded more than a century ago in the northern Italian city of Mantua. They automatically equate it with what might be the best utility sports coat a man can buy. Unlined and unfussy, it still retains distinguishing elements of fine Italian tailoring — that is, high armholes, a fitted but far from exaggerated body and subtle palette resulting from the use of uncolored fabrics that are garment dyed after manufacturing.Roughly a decade ago, Nick Sullivan, the fashion director of Esquire, named the L.B.M. 1911 blazer the one jacket any stylish guy needed in his wardrobe, an opinion he has since found little reason to revise.“I instantly loved it,"" Mr. Sullivan said. “It had all the hallmarks of Italian tailoring and personal style, but it wasn’t crazy expensive.”By that he meant roughly $700. And, while inexpensive labor, technology and some of the less salubrious dimensions of a free market have made it possible to buy a decent (well, acceptable) suit for as little as $300 in the United States, the added value of looking better than basic comes with a cost.Before M. Dumas & Sons, a 102-year-old retailer in Charleston, S.C., began offering the L.B.M. 1911 jackets that are now a staple, its offerings tended toward American labels and a brand of styling that was, to put it tactfully, middle of the road. “We hadn’t done a good enough job in evolving to include Italian product or European products in general,” said Gary Flynn, part owner and president of the store.“Our business is pretty casual, but the L.B.M. 1911 is a soft coat, an unlined coat, what we call an empty coat,” he said, one that both meets the sartorial needs of guys occupying that sartorial gray area between the straitjacketed corporate drones and the Hoodie Horde of Mountain View, Calif., and that also justifies its price tag with the inner construction that linings are often used to hide.Anyway, customers at M. Dumas & Sons don’t get hung up on the price of an L.B.M. 1911 blazer, Mr. Flynn said. And why should they when, as Mr. Sullivan points out, a pair of Balenciaga sneakers costs $900 and it is easy for many to drop $400 on video games without thinking too much about it?“Guys at work are still throwing on a sports coat, but maybe with a pair of jeans,” Mr. Flynn said. “And, if they’re on the fence about price, they say: ‘Oh, shoot, it’s only $795. It’s not, like, $1,495 or $1,795.’”What the typical consumer of L.B.M. 1911 — which occupies a central booth in the main pavilion at Pitti Uomo, just a short stroll away from that of Brunello Cucinelli, a designer who also parlayed a variant of what he calls “casual Italian elegance,” into a multi-billion-dollar global empire — is not likely to know is that every jacket comes with an unusual industrial back story.“It’s the Model-T Ford of jackets,” Mr. Sullivan said. And, as it happens, Edgardo Bianchi, the son of the master tailor who started a small shop in Mantua in 1911, is often referred to as the Henry Ford of the Italian fashion industry.Like Ford, Mr. Bianchi was single-minded to the point of obsession about efficiency and streamlined production. He measured his own quotidian rituals with a chronometer, organizing his regimen according to a schedule that allotted two minutes each morning for shaving and exactly enough time at breakfast to consume 28 grapes.In reality, as his grandson Andrea Benedini said, he preferred to eat more, yet removing the detested seeds proved too time consuming. So he designed a special utensil — part knife and part spoon — that allowed him to reach his preferred allowance of 30 grapes a day.Mr. Bianchi died in 2003, having built his modest family business into an industrial empire and been rewarded for his efforts by a knighthood conferred by the Italian government. The company he left behind is still run according to his belief that every action in life is repeated in an unending loop. “He was obsessed most of all with statistics,’’ said Mr. Benedini, the international export manager for Lubiam, the parent company of L.B.M. 1911. “Organization was the key word for him not only for business but for life.’’Efficient assembly line methods are hardly the stuff of fashion innovation, and Mr. Benedini is the first to say that his men’s wear label may be, by some lights, boring.“We don’t like a jacket with 10 pockets and a hole in the back,” Mr. Benedini said. “If you look at our collection, the models are pretty much the same each season.”But that is not exactly the case. While a label specializing in subtle modifications by season — the current one features luxurious cotton corduroys and herringbone knits — and theme-and-variation is never going to become Instagram catnip in the age of likes and followers. But there’s something stealthily sexy about the low-key way that L.B.M. 1911 has built a clientele without the aid of influencers or salaried peacocks or Gucci-style frippery.“Guys have really embraced this deconstructed concept,"" said Steven Ramenofsky, the general merchandise manager of Garys, a specialty men’s wear retailer in Newport Beach, Calif. “Sure, other labels make soft jackets,” Mr. Ramenofsky said, citing better-known brands like Canali or Boglioli or Peter Millar, all of which cost considerably more than the Mantua-made jackets with the signature ceramic button on the lapel. “But, however you look at it, L.B.M. 1911 sure does hold its own.” "
"Sports Betting May Soon Be Legal in New York, but Only 4 Casinos Upstate Would Offer It - The New York Times
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]ALBANY — New York moved a giant step toward legalized sports betting on Monday, as the State Gaming Commission offered initial approval of a 33-page set of proposed rules that would allow such wagers at four upstate casinos.The unanimous decision of the seven-person commission comes less than a year after a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for such operations outside of Nevada, which once had a monopoly on betting parlors under a 1992 law.Since then, other states have legalized sports betting, including New Jersey, whose lawmakers had long clamored for it and passed it last year. The state now allows such betting in casinos and at racetracks, and also allows people within the state’s borders to place wagers online.The New York State Legislature has yet to pass a law that could replicate New Jersey’s expansive offerings, so on Monday, the commission took the initiative by signing off on a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” designed to allow hometown fans to have another reason to bemoan the Knicks, Jets, Giants or Mets.But hold your horses. While the gaming commission has certainly matriculated the ball down the field, nothing will happen in time for you to legally bet on the Super Bowl this weekend in New York. Here is a quick explanation of where things lie.Well, you can if you go to New Jersey, but in New York the gaming commission’s decision will not become official until after a 60-day public comment period, after which the commission still needs to review those comments and then formally adopt the rule — presuming there is no objections. That means that there will be no betting in New York casinos until late March, at the absolute earliest (maybe just in time for baseball’s opening day or the Final Four). The casinos will also need a “sports pool license” to be issued by the Gaming Commission.That said, preparations are underway for sports betting at all four casinos, with plans being drawn up for lounges, big screens and tote boards listing all manner of point spreads and money lines.“Our customers want this form of gaming,” said Steven A. Greenberg, a spokesman for the del Lago Casino in Tyre, N.Y. “And we’re excited to be able to offer it to them.”Uh, no. Not even close. The closest of the four casinos is Resorts World Catskills in Monticello, N.Y.; sports betting will also be allowed at the Rivers Casino in Schenectady; the del Lago Casino, in Tyre, a small town southeast of Rochester; and Tioga Downs, west of Binghamton.The reason the four are so far-flung — as least from a New York City perspective — is rooted in the 2013 law that authorized the expansion of casinos in New York, part of a plan pushed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as a way to enliven long-sluggish upstate communities and their economies. That has not happened, as all four have struggled to meet their promises of tax revenue and in some cases, their debt payments.The governor’s embrace of sports betting is an acknowledgment of how it could help draw people to those casinos, as well as an acknowledgment of the competition from other states (see New Jersey).Those ads, for companies like FanDuel and DraftKings, are aimed for New Jersey residents and sports gamblers visiting the state.It is not at all clear if New York will authorize online betting, which is a potentially much bigger moneymaker than the so-called brick-and-mortar operations the Gaming Commission gave its initial approval to on Monday.The Cuomo administration has expressed the opinion that authorizing online bets would require changing the State Constitution. That is a time-consuming process; any such change would require passage by two separate legislatures and approval via a voter referendum. That means 2021, at the very earliest. Needless to say, casinos are not pleased by this interpretation or this timetable.New York sports bettors do have one option that their New Jersey brethren do not: tribal casinos.Betting will likely be available at Turning Stone, the hugely successful operation outside Syracuse, which is owned by the Oneida Indian Nation. Earlier this month, the Oneidas announced a partnership with Caesar’s Entertainment to open betting lounges at Turning Stone and two other smaller casinos nearby in 2019.Pretty much any professional or major collegiate sporting event. Betting on politics and other cultural events — the winner of “The Voice,” for example, or the coming Democratic presidential primary cage-match — will not be allowed.No one under age 21 will be allowed to bet, and the rules provide that casinos can decline any bet over $10,000. Though it seems unlikely that the struggling upstate casinos are likely to turn people away. Sports betting is not the most lucrative game for casinos — slot machines, for example, generate far more profits — but they do offer an amenity to get bettors to come and spend time. As one chief executive, Ryan Eller of Empire Resorts, put it: “Casinos that already offer sports betting have seen an increase in companion play.”Translation: People like to sit around and watch professional sports, particularly if they have money on it. And while they are there, they might throw a few bucks on a table or in a slot machine.Not without online gaming, casino officials say. There is an enormous market for betting on your phone or laptop, and not just with sites affiliated with New Jersey casinos. Offshore sites offer wagers on anything from snooker to Icelandic basketball to American politics (where Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat is considered a very, very long shot to win the 2020 Democratic nomination).Until that is legalized by the Legislature and the voters, however, gamblers will have to go to casinos to place their bets, and casinos are promising to welcome them with open arms. At Turning Stone, for example, officials are already constructing their betting parlor, promising a 48-by-9-foot curved screen visible from three sides, as well as 17 other massive televisions, something the casino promises will “create a ‘wow’ impact.”Now if someone could just fix the Knicks."
"Feud Over Soccer Piracy Deepens as A.F.C. Ends BeIN Sports Contract - The New York Times
A toxic political dispute is threatening to sink the Persian Gulf’s biggest sports television contract, a development that could have repercussions for other broadcast rights agreements worth billions of dollars.The Asian Football Confederation, the governing body for soccer in the region, on Tuesday unilaterally broke its exclusive contract with its Middle Eastern broadcast partner, the Qatar-based beIN Media Group, so that it could broadcast matches in Saudi Arabia, a country where beIN has been banned amid a bitter diplomatic and economic crisis between Gulf neighbors that is now in its second year.The A.F.C’s decision to nullify its contract for the broadcast rights to games in Saudi Arabia comes even after rulers there have allowed a major piracy operation, perhaps the most sophisticated in television history, to steal billions of dollars of sports content owned by beIN since 2017.BeIN’s rights deals with the A.F.C., which run through 2020, are worth $300 million. The broadcaster immediately announced its intention to file a lawsuit to counter the decision to strip it of the rights to games broadcast in Saudi Arabia, which comes weeks before the A.F.C.’s president, Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, stands for re-election. His opposition in that vote consists of a candidate from the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, and another from Qatar.Yousef Al-Obaidly, beIN’s chief executive, said Tuesday’s decision was not a coincidence; he accused the A.F.C. of colluding with Saudi Arabia ahead of April’s election.“It is remarkable to see the governing body of football across Asia — which should, by definition, be apolitical — putting politics ahead of its long-term commercial interests and established legitimate relationships,” Al-Obaidly told The New York Times in an emailed statement. “We will use the full force of international law to claim every dollar of damages we have and will incur as a result of the A.F.C.’s unilateral breach of our agreement.”Previously, the A.F.C. had issued strongly worded condemnations of the theft of beIN’s programming and threats of legal action against the Saudi-based piracy operation, dubbed BeoutQ.The dispute comes at a delicate time, with beIN Media and the A.F.C locked in negotiations over a new regional contract. The A.F.C. had tried to persuade beIN to agree to purchase future rights but without access to Saudi Arabia, the Gulf’s biggest market.News of a separate deal with the A.F.C. for the Saudi rights was first announced by the Saudi soccer federation, well before the A.F.C.’s released its own brief statement on the matter almost 24 hours later.Salman, who is also a FIFA vice president, has made no comment. The A.F.C said its decision to stream games in Saudi Arabia on its own channels was an attempt to tackle piracy. But within hours, its content was available on other platforms across Saudi Arabia, including on the free-to-air channel Saudi 24. A promise to geoblock coverage so it could only be viewed inside the Gulf’s most-populous country also failed, with the A.F.C.’s stream of its Champions League games available outside the kingdom.Rights owners across the spectrum of sports, from FIFA to the governing bodies for tennis and track and field, have lodged complaints over the industrial scale piracy of their broadcast rights by BeoutQ. The latest twist could threaten the billions of dollars in income those organizations are able to extract for their content, according to beIN. The company said broadcasters would be unlikely to pay vast sums for exclusive contracts if those rights could be protected.“There is now no guaranteed protection of intellectual property in the region to due to the A.F.C. in effect endorsing Saudi Arabia’s theft of world sport and wholesale disregard for the international rule of law,” the network said.CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first hat trick for Juventus to send the club into the Champions League quarterfinals with a 3-0 win over Atlético Madrid on Tuesday. The Italian side fought back from a two-goal first-leg defeat.Ronaldo scored from open play in each half and then converted a late penalty as Juventus advanced by 3-2 on aggregate, ending Atlético’s hopes of reaching the final, which will be held in its Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.It was Ronaldo’s eighth hat trick in the competition, moving him even with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and demonstrating why Juventus paid Real Madrid 112 million euros (then $131.5 million) for the Portuguese forward, who has dominated the competition in recent years. Ronaldo is seeking a fourth straight Champions League title; Real Madrid was eliminated without him by Ajax last week.It was the first time Juventus came back from a two-goal defeat in the first leg.“Maybe that’s why Juventus signed me,” Ronaldo said. “To help it do things that it had never done before. This result is a great push for the future. We’re strong and we showed it.”Manchester City also advanced to the quarterfinals, routing Schalke by 7-0 to progress on aggregate, 10-2.Juventus thought it had taken the lead less than three minutes into its game but a video review confirmed that Ronaldo had fouled Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak before Giorgio Chiellini fired in the rebound.But a goal eventually came when Italy forward Federico Bernardeschi put in a cross from the left for Ronaldo to head in at the far post in the 27th minute. Ronaldo got his second goal three minutes into the second half, as Joao Cancelo put in a cross from the right. Although Oblak clawed Ronaldo’s header out from under his crossbar, goal-line technology confirmed the ball had crossed the line.Juventus went all out attack and got the decisive third goal four minutes from the final whistle, when Bernardeschi was nudged over in the penalty area. Ronaldo converted the resulting penalty kick.In Manchester, Manchester City tied the record for the biggest win in the Round of 16 of the Champions League by thrashing Schalke.Sergio Agüero scored twice in the first half for City, and Leroy Sané rolled in another goal before halftime before Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus added second-half goals."
"Trading an Expectant Father? We’ve Seen Stranger - The New York Times
When Derick Brassard was traded from the Florida Panthers to the Colorado Avalanche on Monday, his transportation logistics were not too tricky. He just headed over to the other team’s locker room. The Panthers and the Avalanche faced off Monday night, and Brassard duly scored a goal for his new team.In other offbeat N.H.L. trade-deadline news, Mikael Granlund was sent from the Minnesota Wild to the Nashville Predators on Monday while his partner was in labor.When you think about it, a trade is a strange thing. Imagine showing up to work tomorrow and finding yourself sent to Albuquerque along with Bob from Accounting for some young coding prospects.Given all the trades in all the sports over the years, it is not surprising that there have been some unusual ones.Guys have been traded for one, two, three, four or even five other players. Players have been traded for just about anything but a bucket of balls. Oh, wait. Scratch that. Tim Fortugno, a minor league pitcher, was sent from the Reno Silver Sox to the Stockton Brewers in 1989 for $2,500 and some baseballs. “I told them to throw in 12 dozen balls and we had a deal,” Jack Patton, the Silver Sox general manager, told The Los Angeles Times.Other legendary baseball swaps: Cy Young in 1890 for a new suit, and Ken Krahenbuhl in 1998 for catfish. Not Catfish Hunter, but 10 pounds of actual catfish.Teams have traded for coaches, including Jon Gruden, Lou Piniella, Doc Rivers and Bill Belichick. They have even traded for announcers: Ernie Harwell cost the Brooklyn Dodgers a player, Cliff Dapper, in 1948.Sometimes a player is traded for a player to be named later. In the case of Harry Chiti of the Indians in 1962, the player to be named later turned out to be Harry Chiti.In international soccer, trades are more unusual, but it’s not uncommon for smaller teams to ask bigger teams to agree to a lucrative friendly game as a part of a transfer deal.Forget three-team trades. There have been four-team trades, including the one in the N.B.A. that sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012. There has even been a five-team trade, a 13-player blockbuster in 2005 that sent Antoine Walker to the Miami Heat.One of the more memorable trades of recent years never actually happened. During a Mets home game in 2015, word reached the dugout and the many fans with smartphones that Wilmer Flores was being traded. Flores continued to play in the game, and the clued-in fans cheered the player in his “final” game as a Met. Flores was seen with tears in his eyes.Only the deal fell through. Flores remained a Met, and he quickly went from fan favorite to beloved Met hero for the next three years. (He was released in November.)Perhaps the strangest trade of all took place in 1979. The Philadelphia 76ers sent Harvey Catchings and Ralph Simpson to the Nets for Eric Money and Al Skinner.So what’s unusual? No, it’s not that Simpson’s daughter is the singer India Arie.The two teams had played each other in November, with the 76ers winning in double overtime. But the Nets protested the game, arguing that a number of technical fouls had been called improperly. The commissioner agreed and ordered the last part of the game to be replayed. The replay was scheduled for March.But by then the trade had taken place. Now four players were on different teams than when the game began.Sure enough, the final box score credits Money with 23 points for the Nets and 4 for the Sixers. Catchings and Simpson also played for both teams in the game.That’s a story that’s going to be hard to beat. Remember those four players who were traded in the middle of the third quarter?"

"8 Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality - The New York Times
On Friday, all 28 players on the United States women’s soccer team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, an escalation in their increasingly public battle for equality.The players have said that they play more games than the men’s team — and win more of them — yet still receive less pay. They said “institutionalized gender discrimination” affected not only their paychecks, but also where they played and how often, how they trained, the medical care and coaching they received, and even how they traveled to matches.They are not alone in their fight for fairer pay and better treatment. Here are eight times in recent memory when women fought for equality in sports.Experts claimed for years that distance running was damaging to women’s health and femininity.In 1967, women weren’t allowed to officially enter the Boston Marathon, so Kathrine Switzer entered that year as “K.V. Switzer” to hide her gender.Two miles in, an official tried to eject her from the course, a moment captured in dramatic photographs. She finished anyway, becoming the first woman to complete the race as an official entrant.“We learned that women are not deficient in endurance and stamina, and that running requires no fancy facilities or equipment,” Switzer wrote in The New York Times in 2007.Women were officially allowed to enter the race in 1972. Women’s marathoning joined the Olympics in 1984.The year 1973 was a big one for Billie Jean King, the trailblazing tennis star.She founded the Women’s Tennis Association. She led a movement for female players to earn equal prize money in tournaments that featured players of both sexes.And, on a September night at the Astrodome in Houston, she epitomized her crusade for gender equality when she handily beat Bobby Riggs, a self-described male chauvinist pig, in the Battle of the Sexes.King went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for her work championing the rights of women and gay people. She is considered to be one of the most important athletes of the 20th century.“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs,” King once said. “I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”Chris Ernst is a two-time Olympic rower. But in the spring of 1976, she was the captain of Yale University’s women’s crew team — and sick of not having proper showers to use after practice.She led 18 teammates in an eye-catching protest at Yale’s athletic office. The athletes stripped to their waists, revealing the words “Title IX,” which had been drawn in blue marker on each woman’s back and breasts.The Times ran an article in the next day’s paper, and a photograph of the history-making event also ran in The Yale Daily News.Within two weeks, the female rowers had new locker rooms. And, across the country, educators began viewing Title IX — which had been in effect for just four years — as a law that required compliance.In 2007, after pressure from the tennis great Venus Williams and others, Wimbledon announced that women’s tennis players would receive prize money equal to the men’s.Williams had made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she won the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed essay in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.”“Have you ever been let down by someone that you had long admired, respected and looked up to?” she wrote. “Little in life is more disappointing, particularly when that person does something that goes against the very heart of what you believe is right and fair.”After the policies changed in 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her fourth Wimbledon victory, the same amount as the men’s champion, Roger Federer.In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey, the sport’s national governing body, did not increase the women’s wages.“It’s hard to believe that in 2017, we have to fight so hard just to get equitable support,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women.”They put their careers on the line, but the risk paid off.Less than two weeks later, the team reached a four-year deal with U.S.A. Hockey. It provided the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. The team also received the same travel and insurance provisions that the men’s national team did, and a pool of prize money to be split each year.Four prominent female big-wave surfers, Bianca Valenti, Andrea Moller, Keala Kennelly and Paige Alms, spent years fighting for equal pay in the largely male sport where they regularly risk their lives.Last July, the Committee for Equity in Women’s Surfing, an organization formed by six women, sent letters to the California Coastal Commission arguing that by treating women unequally, the World Surf League was in violation of state civil rights law.Months later, in September, Valenti and other female surfers earned a victory when the World Surf League announced it would offer equal prize money to men and women.Valenti, along with Sabrina Brennan, the president of the San Mateo County Harbor Commission, and Karen Tynan, a labor lawyer, also successfully pushed for women to be included in the Maverick’s Challenge, a big-wave surfing competition that had traditionally invited only men.“Some people would tell me that by trying to get the (prize) pie redistributed I was ruining it for everyone,” Moller said in December. “But I would just say: ‘That’s wrong. We’re fighting for the industry. People love watching women surf big waves, so the whole sport will grow.’”In the world of professional basketball, pay disparities are well-documented: In the N.B.A., a multibillion-dollar industry where players often make millions, the minimum starting salary is about eight times what the average W.N.B.A. player makes.And female players are speaking up, on social media and on TV.Skylar Diggins-Smith, the W.N.B.A. All-Star who plays guard for the Dallas Wings, recently appeared in a commercial to raise awareness about pay inequity.The commercial, by the investment adviser Wealthsimple, contrasts the paths of two young players, a boy and a girl. Each lists their basketball dreams and accomplishments, but only one will grow up to receive a multimillion-dollar rookie contract.A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the first overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, has also weighed in: “must. be. nice,” she wrote about LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “We over here looking for a M but Lord, let me get back in my lane.”Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, was expected to earn about $6.8 million in his first year playing for the Phoenix Suns.Ada Hegerberg, a 23-year-old Norwegian, was recognized as the best female soccer player in the world last year when she became the first person to win the women’s Ballon d'Or, a prestigious individual honor in soccer that had previously been reserved for men.Despite the big award, she has decided not to play on the biggest stage of all, the Women’s World Cup, in France this summer.Hegerberg quit the Norwegian national team in 2017 in protest of what she said was a lack of support for women’s soccer in her home country.“I was quite clear with them about what I thought needed to be better,” she said in an interview after winning the Ballon d’Or. “I gave them the reasons. I wish my national team all the best. I love my country. I wish I could play for them. In this case, I had to move on.”"
"A Sports Hijab Has France Debating the Muslim Veil, Again - The New York Times
PARIS — Plans by a major sporting goods company in France to sell a hijab designed for runners have incited yet another debate over what Muslim women wear, exposing once again the tensions between secularism and religion in the country.France’s longstanding attitudes toward feminism, secularism and the integration of immigrants are at the root of the many controversies, but they are also fueled by recent fears about Islamist terrorism, along with the rise of social media.The most recent debate centers on plans by Decathlon, Europe’s largest sporting goods retailer, to sell the hijab, which covers the wearer’s head and neck. Criticism quickly came from many quarters, with one lawmaker saying that the debate laid bare “this obsession around the veil and Islam.”Decathlon had started selling the sports hijab in Morocco last week and planned to do so in France. The move was quickly criticized on social media, and several politicians expressed discomfort about the product being sold in France. Some even suggested a boycott.“My choice as a woman and a citizen will be to no longer trust a brand that breaks with our values,” said Aurore Bergé, a spokeswoman for Republic on the Move, President Emmanuel Macron’s party. “Those who tolerate women in the public space only when they are hiding are not lovers of freedom.”Decathlon initially stood firm, arguing that it was focused on “democratizing” sports and that Muslim women often ran with “ill-adapted” hijabs.“Our goal is simple: to offer them a suitable sports product, without judging,” the company said in a statement on Twitter.It’s unclear why Decathlon became the focus of such criticism. Nike already sells hijabs for runners in France, but it has not faced the same scrutiny, possibly because it’s not a French brand. Some politicians defended Decathlon, with Aurélien Taché, a representative from Mr. Macron’s party, saying that France “would do well” without “this obsession around the veil and Islam.”But Decathlon backtracked and on Tuesday, halting its plans to sell the sports hijab in France after — it said — salespeople were threatened in stores, some physically, and after it received hundreds of calls and emails.One message accused the company of “betraying” France and “contributing to the Islamist invasion,” the company said.Since 2011, it has been illegal to wear a face-covering veil in public in France, but the hijab does not fall into that category. Still, in recent years, Muslim women wearing the hijab and other garments have prompted friction — locally and on a national scale.Last year, Maryam Pougetoux, a student union leader drew public ire after appearing on television wearing a head scarf.In the summer of 2016, a nationwide debate erupted over the “burkini,” the full-body bathing suit designed for practicing Muslim women; the item was briefly banned in some coastal towns in southern France.In some cases, other pieces of clothing have become the target of critics. In 2015, a French school sent a 15-year-old student home, saying that her long skirt was an “ostentatious sign” of her Muslim faith. Since 2004, it has been illegal for students to wear any visible signs of religious affiliation.Laïcité, the concept of state secularism, is a defining principle of the French republic, but it has often been a point of friction between Muslims and the state. “France is a very secular society, which can be very virulent against any kind of religious expression, even those that are legal or do not threaten public order,” said Nicolas Cadène, a senior member of the Observatory of Secularism, an agency that assists the government in enforcing laïcité. The European Union’s highest court ruled in 2017 that employer bans on hijabs in the private sector could be legal. But the debate about the veil is no longer about its legality, but rather its symbolism. On the right and far right, it is often seen as a rebuke of France’s secular values and a sign of a lack of integration. Across the political spectrum, the veil is often seen as an intrinsic symbol of submission that goes against gender equality, even when worn freely. Some feminists say that wearing it sends the wrong signal to women elsewhere in the world who are fighting to live without it.Marlène Schiappa, the junior minister for gender equality, wrote in The HuffPost on Wednesday that women should be allowed to wear the hijab, but that it was necessary to “question that choice.”But others feminists and politicians on the left, as well as Muslim advocacy groups, argue that it is hypocritical to say hijab-wearing women are withdrawing from French society while criticizing garments like the burkini or sports hijabs designed to help them feel comfortable in public life.Sylvie Eberena, 38, a Muslim entrepreneur and coach who runs a fitness website, said she found the discussions over attire “exhausting.”“It’s not about politics or religion,” she said. “Every human being wants to feel good within their own bodies, so if a piece of clothing can help with that, why not?”Since she began appearing in fitness videos wearing her hijab nearly a decade ago, Ms. Eberena said, she has seen many more veiled women practicing sports.Laura Cha, a spokeswoman for the Muslim feminist organization Lallab, added that “for those who are not directly impacted by the hijab, it’s just one more controversy, but for Muslim women, it has some nefarious, long-lasting consequences.”“It’s a shame that Decathlon didn’t stand firm,” Laetitia Gahoudi, 37, a Muslim entrepreneur and personal trainer, said on Wednesday. “But we didn’t wait for Decathlon to sell a runner’s hijab to work out with our head scarves. And we will keep working out without them.”"
"Thinking of a Jumbotron Proposal? Some Say, Ugh. Others, Say Yes. - The New York Times
Jumbotron proposals have become as much a part of baseball as the seventh-inning stretch — no matter that they are often considered tacky and in bad taste.When a proposal appears on the giant screen, a large segment of sports Twitter world (mostly women) chime in about how they hope no one ever proposes to them at a sporting event. Still, hundreds of these public, grandiose gestures happen every year and many proposees walk out of the stadium happily ever after.On March 31, 2018, Joanna Chan, who works for Netflix, proposed to her girlfriend of five years, Julie Morris, who is employed at Hulu. The moment happened during the first period of a Calgary Flames game and was shown on the giant screen at Scotiabank Saddledome — known as the Enmax Energy Board — home to the National Hockey League’s Flames.Ms. Chan and Ms. Morris, both 36 and living in Los Angeles (since married and now both going by Chan-Morris), had just embarked on a five-year tour of all 31 N.H.L. arenas, and the Saddledome was their final stop.Joanna Chan-Morris says that a few stops before their final one, she knew she wanted to propose in Calgary. “It’s not about the public aspect of the proposal, really,” she said. “It was really just about making that last game special.”Even still, with that gesture, their engagement became a viral sensation, traveling beyond the area and onto the internet. Joanna paid 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,782) for the opportunity, which she says was “worth every penny.”The Saddledome is far from the only sports arena that gives fans the option to propose on a really big TV screen in front of thousands. Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, does 50 to 60 live, in-game proposals each season at a cost of $350 each. At Dodger Stadium, getting engaged onscreen will set you back $5,000, an event the team estimates happens two or three times a season.The National Basketball Association’s Atlanta Hawks do several proposals a season, and the New York Knicks have a $500 proposal package for purchase. The Knicks have had “seven completed proposals so far this season,” the team said, and the package includes a split screen with video of the proposal on one side and your written message (“So-and-so, will you marry me?”) on the other. Most teams request that the payment come in the form of a donation to the team’s charity. Some sports organizations, though, like the Boston Celtics, don’t provide the option to propose on their giant screen at all.Even though sports fans come from all genders, there’s an assumption that mostly men will be viewing the proposal, including the players. “Sports stadiums are not gender-neutral territory,” said Dr. Leslie Bell, the author of “Hard to Get: Twenty-Something Women and the Paradox of Sexual Freedom” (University of California Press, 2018). Just like rooting for your favorite team to win, she said, a woman saying yes to a proposal can be viewed as a sort of victory.The whole concept irks Jessica Kleinschmidt, a content producer/reporter at NBC Sports Bay Area and a self-proclaimed “hater of in-game proposals.”“It’s as if this person needs to show these complete strangers they love this person by making a show out of it,” Ms. Kleinschmidt said. “Needing validation from complete strangers? Go on Twitter if you want to do that.”Also, she noted, an in-game proposal “puts the woman under pressure to say yes.”When those traditional gender dynamics are reversed, the public response can be cruel.In 2014, a woman surprised her boyfriend by proposing to him at an N.B.A. game. At the time, she told Fox 5 DC, “I thought this would make me the best wife-to-be ever to do it in front of his favorite team.” Her fiancé seemed happy she asked. But the response online was less than kind, with the frequently misogynist sports and culture website Barstool Sports calling it “the absolute worst proposal of all time,” among other worse things. Another blogger wrote that he would “never want to be proposed to by my girlfriend, and at an N.B.A. game no less, not in a million years.”When Jumbotron proposals go wrong, spectators take an almost perverse pleasure in the rejection. In 2017, a rejected proposal at Fenway Park resulted in the entire ballpark chanting, “She said no!” (Jasmine Guillory’s newest novel, aptly named “The Proposal,” opens with a rejected proposal at Dodger Stadium that goes viral on the internet.)This virality is something that more and more Jumbotron proposers are experiencing now that social media is a thing and everyone in the stadium has a smartphone, or the teams broadcast feel-good content across their various platforms.What is it about our culture’s ideas about love, romance and marriage that allowed the phenomenon to gain traction in the first place? “Romantic comedies,” Chloe Angyal wrote for Buzzfeed in 2015, “teach us that the truer a true love is, the grander and more public the public grand gesture will be.”It’s hard to know when the gimmick originated, but it had to be sometime after video screens were installed in stadiums; Dodger Stadium was among the first, in 1980. But the technology has given rise to an entire industry of what Laurie Essig, the author of “Love, Inc.: Dating Apps, the Big White Wedding, and Chasing the Happily Neverafter” (University of California Press, 2019) calls “spectacular proposals.”Jumbotron proposals are, of course, grandiose gestures, broadcasting love and commitment onto a giant screen for tens of thousands, and now, with the advent of social media, millions of eyes to consume. They are larger than life. “I just thought it would make it that much more special,” to put it on the Jumbotron instead of just proposing in the concourse, said Tyler Garrison, 40, who proposed to his now-husband, Ty Fleming, at Nationals Park in 2017. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Fleming, 35, live in Washington and are season ticket holders, which is why Mr. Garrison says he thought the big proposal would be “creating a special moment that we can have for the rest of our lives.”Mr. Garrison never imagined that the moment would be viewed millions of times across the internet. He had planned the proposal with help from a friend, Robert York, a board member of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit athletic advocacy group. It was one of the first same-sex marriage proposals on a screen at a Major League Baseball game.When the Chan-Morrises got engaged in Calgary last year, Joanna says the team was initially concerned that her request was a prank or a desire to make a political statement. But after she persuaded them that she just wanted to get engaged — something a straight couple would almost never have to prove — the moment was one of the most touching Jumbotron proposals in recent memory. It similarly went viral, and the response was mostly enthusiastic.Responses to these same sex engagements were overwhelmingly positive perhaps because they run contrary to who typically gets engaged at sporting events.But heartwarming feedback is not always the case. Marlyn Sanchez said she made the mistake of reading the comments under the YouTube video of her proposal at Marlins Park last year, and “people were so mean.” Ms. Sanchez, a 37-year-old curriculum support specialist for Miami-Dade County Public Schools and also a singer, had sung the national anthem at the ballpark before, which gave her now-fiancé, Rafael Cabrera, an “in” with the team. She was contacted and asked to come back and perform, and to throw the first pitch. Unbeknown to her, the person who caught the ball was Mr. Cabrera. He walked over, got down on one knee, and proposed. (The two plan to marry in May.)Commenters joked that, because of the low attendance at Miami Marlins games, it appeared like Mr. Cabrera had rented out the entire stadium for her. Other people jabbed that it must have taken guts to propose in front of tens of people.Mr. Cabrera, 35, was a former minor league ballplayer, and even though Ms. Sanchez says she isn’t necessarily a Marlins fan, the proposal was perfect because it was “totally him.” Even though they had never talked about the idea of public proposals, Ms. Sanchez says Mr. Cabrera would always say to her: “Don’t even give me any hints of what you want, because I’m gonna do it in my own way and that’s that.”Although Ms. Sanchez says she has “thick skin” when it comes to criticism, in part because she’s a performer, getting engaged in such a public way invites feedback from viewers that not everyone will take in stride the way she did.But for Julie Chan-Morris, when Joanna proposed to her in front of nearly 20,000 people in the Saddledome, she says it was surprisingly intimate. “It sounds crazy because there was so many people who were in attendance at the Saddledome that night,” she said, “but it was as if it was just us for a moment.”She also understands the criticism levied at people who get engaged on Jumbotrons. “I think that, honestly, had Joanna just randomly done a public proposal,” Julie said, “I don’t think I would’ve been into it. But it was completely justified because of where we were,” with the arena tour."
"Soccer Player’s Detention Poses ‘Historic Test’ for Global Sports - The New York Times
BANGKOK — The global sports market is worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Now, this powerful industry is coming together to promote an unlikely cause: human rights.Since late November, a Bahrain-born soccer player for a minor team in Australia has been held in detention in Thailand. The player, Hakeem al-Araibi, 24, is not a famous athlete. He has no lucrative sponsors.But he has spoken out against one of the most powerful men in international soccer, who is also a member of the ruling family of Bahrain. His testimony of torture at the hands of Bahrain’s repressive government earned him refugee status in Australia, which determined that he faced credible threats of persecution should he return to the Gulf state.Still, over the past week, Mr. Araibi has collected an impressive list of supporters in the world of international sports.Fatma Samoura, the secretary general of FIFA, the international body governing global soccer, has called for Thailand to return him to Australia “as a matter of urgency.” So has Thomas Bach, the head of the International Olympic Committee, who raised the issue with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.On Tuesday, Praful Patel, a vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, issued a statement asking Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand to ensure Mr. Araibi’s return to his adopted home.The head of the Asian Football Confederation is Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini official whom Mr. Araibi accused of not stopping the persecution of athletes in his charge. Sheikh Salman also serves as a FIFA vice president.Such a collection of statements of support is rare, said Mary Harvey, the chief executive of the Center for Sports and Human Rights, which assembles governments, sports bodies, corporate sponsors and nongovernmental groups to ensure the role of human rights in sports.“Hakeem is a historic test case, because it’s the first time that we’ve seen these big, powerful sports bodies all come together publicly to address the fate of a single person,” said Ms. Harvey, who was a member of the United States national soccer team and a FIFA executive.Sports has been buffeted by growing concerns about the hidden human costs of mega-events, like the Olympics and the World Cup, that have been used to bring international glory to authoritarian governments. Hundreds of foreign laborers, mainly from South Asia, have died in the building of stadiums and other infrastructure for the 2022 men’s soccer World Cup in Qatar, according to the International Trade Union Confederation.Although the Qatari government has pledged to improve the rights of its migrant work force, some construction workers and foreign athletes continue to work in what is essentially indentured servitude, human-rights monitors say.Last year’s hosting of the men’s soccer World Cup by Russia was marred by racism and homophobia controversies. Both bids for the World Cup by Qatar and Russia were tarnished by a series of corruption scandals that cleared out a significant portion of FIFA’s leadership ranks. With corporate sponsors nervous about a backlash from sports fans, FIFA unveiled a series of reforms aimed at bettering its human rights.In January, Brendan Schwab, the executive director of the World Players Association, which represents 85,000 professional athletes worldwide, wrote an urgent legal request on the “severe violation of the human rights” of Mr. Araibi, which was submitted to FIFA. The brief was also signed by unions representing professional soccer players.“Hakeem’s case is about a football player, it’s about a human-rights defender, it’s about a refugee and it’s about global sport’s ability to uphold its stated commitment to human rights,” Mr. Schwab said.Although FIFA now has binding human-rights policies, they are largely untested. Even though FIFA’s human rights advisory board was formed two years ago, the request on Mr. Araibi’s behalf was the first time such a formal submission had been made.When Mr. Araibi traveled to Bangkok on Nov. 27 with his wife for a belated honeymoon, the Thai authorities were waiting for him at the airport.Initially, Thai officials said Mr. Araibi had been detained based on an Interpol request alerting the immigration authorities to fugitives of justice. But Interpol quickly lifted that request because such alerts, called red notices, are not supposed to apply to refugees.Nevertheless, Bahrain has formally asked Thailand for Mr. Araibi’s extradition so he can return to face a 10-year prison sentence for a conviction in absentia on charges that he burned a police station, among other convictions.Last week, the extradition request was passed on to the Thai attorney general’s office, said Busadee Santipitaks, a spokeswoman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meaning that Mr. Araibi’s fate could be decided in a matter of days.Mr. Araibi was playing in a televised football match when the police station he was supposed to have attacked was burned. Bahrain has racked up thousands of questionable convictions related to its crushing of its Arab Spring movement in 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis joined street protests, human rights groups say.Thailand, which has not signed an international convention on refugees, has a history of extraditing human rights defenders to countries they have fled, like China or Bahrain, where they are likely to face imprisonment or torture.In early January, however, a Saudi teenager who had flown to Bangkok and feared death from her family, avoided deportation and was eventually allowed to travel on to Canada, where she was granted asylum. Her release followed an outcry on social media.In 2016, Sheikh Salman, who has refused to answer questions about Mr. Araibi’s detention in Thailand, ran for the FIFA presidency. But his front-runner status diminished in part because of questions raised about Bahrain’s record of imprisoning protesters, including members of the national soccer team.Instead, Gianni Infantino, who was born in Switzerland, won the top job. Both Mr. Infantino and Sheikh Salman are up for re-election to their respective posts this year.Running for the first time for a vice-presidential post in the Asian Football Confederation is Somyot Poompanmoung, the leader of the Football Association of Thailand. A former national police chief, Mr. Somyot faced a scandal last year after it emerged that he had received large loans from a fugitive brothel owner implicated in human trafficking.Thailand has mulled the possibility of jointly bidding for the World Cup in 2034 with another Southeast Asian nation. After the tainted bids by Russia and Qatar, updated FIFA guidelines now require that human rights be considered as a factor in deciding which country wins the right to host the prestigious tournament.“Sports, like the Olympics and football, should and can bring social change,” said Craig Foster, a former captain of the Australian national soccer team who has lobbied on Mr. Araibi’s behalf.“We’ve got to hold governments accountable and say, ‘If you want the great honor of hosting these major sports tournaments, then you have to accept global human rights standards,’” he said."
"Short Pants and Long Sleeves: China’s Soccer Team Plays Under Tattoo Ban - The New York Times
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — China’s recent attempts to emerge as a serious soccer nation after decades in the sports wilderness have taken some curious turns. One of the more recent ones is visible — or, rather, invisible — at this month’s Asian Cup.Temperatures in the tournament, which is being played in the United Arab Emirates, can be stifling, making the sight of some Chinese players wearing long-sleeved undershirts beneath their jerseys seem puzzling.The answer lies in a semiofficial edict from Chinese sports officials issued last year that bans tattoos from being visible during matches. The directive applies to the national team but also to Chinese players in domestic competitions, like the Chinese Super League.Soccer is now a national priority under President Xi Jinping, and China’s soccer authorities expect the country’s best players to promote positive values to the next generation of athletes and their parents, some of whom remain wary of allowing their children to play a sport they consider to be dangerous or, worse, frivolous. In many ways, the no-tattoos rule is a microcosm of the never-ending wrestling match that China’s central government conducts with its sometimes-dueling allegiances to modernity and control.The rule can be more onerous for some players than for others. Take the heavily inked central defender Zhang Linpeng. Most of his body, including the entirety of both arms, is heavily tattooed. He has been playing with a compression shirt underneath his national team jersey at the Asian Cup, though he has avoided covering the markings on his right leg and his neck.Other players have less work to do; a tattooed back or calf is often covered by a player’s uniform, while a smaller bit of artwork can be hidden under athletic tape. (Zhang and others have managed to get some respite: Covering tattoos isn’t mandatory for training sessions.)The Chinese soccer federation and tournament organizers clearly do not want to talk about the issue, however. At a news conference before a game with South Korea this week that will decide top spot in Group C, a tournament official tried to shut down a question about the tattoos before the Chinese national team coach, Marcello Lippi of Italy, could answer it.After it was rephrased, Lippi gave a short, diplomatic response, saying he was not unduly concerned by the edict. The team’s captain, Zheng Zhi, sitting to Lippi’s right, stifled a laugh but declined to comment on the issue.“This is only a detail; I don’t really want to talk about this,” Lippi said through a translator.A few months before the ink ban was imposed on Chinese soccer players, television stars faced similar restrictions as part of government efforts to control what viewers were being exposed to in the media. The soccer rules were brought in so quickly, though, that some clubs simply chose to heavily bandage their players before they took the field.The tattoo ban has become a lively topic on Chinese social media. Many people in China appear to support the official view that the players are public figures and should act accordingly. Others have ridiculed the move, which is at odds with a current trend in Western sports, where elaborate tattoos are now as commonplace as cleats and jerseys. Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the Los Angeles Galaxy is covered by them; Barcelona’s Lionel Messi now has a long sleeve of art on his right arm and another on his left leg.Zhang, a defender considered one of China’s best players, did not play in two national-team matches after the tattoo ban was established in March. The official reason was injury, but angry fans speculated on social media that China had been thrashed in matches against Wales and the Czech Republic because it was forced to play without Zhang, who they suspected had been benched because of his body art.China has been pumping millions of dollars into soccer since 2015. A sleepy national league is now backed by some of the country’s biggest companies, whose lavish spending quickly attracted world-class coaches and players in search of some of the biggest paydays in the sport. A more intense focus is on creating a national team capable of transforming itself from a punch line into a force that can compete with the best in Asia and, eventually, against the best in the world.The road to get there has been bumpy, though, with soccer officials, typically political figures, chopping and changing policy, or introducing rules that some have found hard to follow.Last year, for example, top clubs were taken by surprise when the Chinese Football Association suddenly announced the best young players would be pulled from their club teams midseason and sent for military training, a practice that China has used with top athletes in other sports. Images of players with freshly shaved heads being put through drills by specialty trainers were beamed around the country.The effects on some teams were significant. Dalian Yifang F.C. lost four straight games and was pulled toward relegation after three of its young starters were called up.It is unlikely the best young players will be going back to their clubs anytime soon. Plans have been announced to create a team composed of young Chinese to play in the second division for a team recently created by a university in Beijing. The team could function as a kind of second national team.China’s men’s national team has not played in a World Cup since its first appearance in 2002, when it lost all three of its games. Its leaders have targeted hosting the event in 2030, and winning it by 2050. To do that, Xi has set a target for 20,000 training centers and 70,000 soccer fields to be established by 2020.The efforts are immediately visible. Private soccer schools have mushroomed in the major cities, and European coaches of varying abilities are being recruited at staggering rates.Lippi, who won the World Cup as Italy’s manager in 2006, has seen much of it. He moved to China in 2012 to run the big-spending club Guangzhou Evergrande, and has announced that he will step down as national coach after the Asian Cup. He has stressed a focus on youth development as a path to China’s soccer goals.“Six years ago in China there were not so many young players,” he said. “This is the only way if you want to become stronger in the future. China has to continue to work in this direction.”Regardless of how fast it improves, however, don’t be surprised to see some players turning up in long sleeves on the way there."
"Kyler Murray Knows His Options. That’s Why This Isn’t Simple. - The New York Times
Millennials were the first generation to make multitasking a religion. Hovered over by helicopter parents, they — we — were encouraged to see no ceiling to our potential and no limits to our options as we were ferried among school, basketball practice, piano lessons, test-prep tutoring and group outings to the movies.“It’s not the stick that drives them on, it’s the carrot,” David Brooks wrote of the oldest millennials, who were college students in 2001. “Opportunity lures them.”But that, it turns out, was child’s play. Kyler Murray, born in 1997 — making him either an extremely young millennial or a member of the emerging Generation Z — was already set to go from Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback of Oklahoma, a major-conference champion, to budding star outfielder for the Oakland Athletics.Murray added a further twist Monday, though, when he announced — how? on Twitter, of course! — that contrary to expectations he would enter the N.F.L. draft, despite having received a $4.66 million signing bonus with the A’s last year. He had been selected with the ninth overall pick in the Major League Baseball draft on the understanding that this past season would be his last on the gridiron.“I’ve always felt like I could play in the N.F.L.,” Murray said last month. “I’m a confident guy.”He added of football: “I’ve played this game my whole life and I’ve always felt like I could do it.”There are many ways Murray’s pre-professional saga could conclude, and it is not at all certain that he will ever suit up for an N.F.L. team. The league combine is next month; whether Murray shows up will tell us more about his true intentions. (It will also tell us more about his true height, which Oklahoma lists at an already-short-for-an-N.F.L. quarterback 5 feet 10 inches.)Murray and his representatives met with the A’s and a league representative on Sunday, according to a source with knowledge of the talks, where it was established that the A’s could offer him a larger, major-league contract. Murray entered the draft in order to learn more what N.F.L. front offices think of him, the source said.Late last year, Murray and his baseball agent, Scott Boras, insisted that the plan was for Murray to play one season as Oklahoma’s starter and then report to spring training for the Athletics. Such a deal was apparently part of the negotiating process that led to Murray’s baseball contract, and was outlined in a news conference last spring with A’s executives.Still, that Murray would even entertain the possibility of playing both big league baseball and quarterback on Sundays — or would be so self-assured of his talents as to make leveraging one against the other a plausible ploy — is something new in American sports.When Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders were two-sport stars two decades ago, they were a running back and a cornerback. Those are difference-making positions, but quarterback they are not.And in 1994, after Charlie Ward won the Heisman playing quarterback at Florida State, he said he would turn to basketball unless he was picked in the N.F.L. draft’s first round. When he was not, he embarked on a decade-long career in the N.B.A., mostly with the Knicks.The differences between the two pastimes must have seemed blurrier then. Free agency was only dawning in the N.F.L. Many revelations concerning the toll of repeated hits to the head were still years into the future.Nowadays, we know how dangerous football can be. But we also know that young baseball players face many years of some combination of playing in the minor leagues and making lowish salaries under team control before hitting an ostensibly open market into which franchises are seemingly pouring less money every year. All this while franchise quarterbacks sign deals worth $30 million a year after finishing rookie contracts that are not exactly ungenerous.Football versus baseball, in other words, is not the obvious, clear-cut decision that some might have once thought it was.It is conceivable that Murray will not have to choose. He is frequently projected as a first-round N.F.L. draft pick, and already was one in baseball. First-round picks are among the most valuable assets in both leagues, and no team in either would knowingly waste one by using it on someone with no intention of trying to live up to it.Either way, Murray has already transcended the team-first ethos of both sports, exploiting his moment of utmost possibility for all it is worth. This might be the ultimate millennial move: always, always play your cards optimally, and you will maximize your accomplishments.Then again, an older person — even an older millennial — might point out that money, fame and glamour are worth only so much. In the long run, we are all running on a treadmill no matter how fast our 40-yard dash is.This much we know for sure: should he not withdraw his entry into the N.F.L. draft, he will irrevocably give up his final season of eligibility in college football.That is a wholly understandable decision. In college, the pay is lousy, and there is a definite sense that real life is still a thing in the future. But as many a proud alum knows, college can be the best, and real life can be overrated."
"In Science, as in Sports, the Sidelines Matter - The New York Times
Welcome to the hot stove science league.On Thursday, with great fanfare, officials from the U.S. National Science Foundation and U.K. Research and Innovation announced a $30 million project to double the sensitivity of the antennas for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which stunned the world three years ago by detecting space-time ripples from colliding black holes.Only the day before, NASA had announced the selection of its newest astronomy mission: a satellite that will map the entire sky, including millions of galaxies, stars and planets, in three dimensions and 96 colors. The two-year mission, called SPHEREx (short for, hold on, the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer) will look for clues to the as-yet-unknown forces that propelled the Big Bang.Neither announcement would be big news by itself. New projects are springing up all the time. The same week, NASA also announced the formation of a cross-disciplinary research network, the Prebiotic Chemistry and Early Earth Environments Consortium, to help guide future searches for life on other worlds. And last year, with serious fanfare, Congress passed and President Trump signed the National Quantum Initiative, designed to provide more money and organization into harnessing the most arcane science of quantum mechanics for computing and cryptography.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]The upgraded LIGO — Advanced LIGO Plus — won’t kick in until 2024 or so, although classic Advanced LIGO will be back online sometime this spring, on the prowl for whatever is out there. And NASA’s SPHEREx won’t be launched until 2023 or later.But the close timing of the announcements is a reminder of an aspect of science that gets scant attention. Especially at Nobel Prize time, we applaud a few heroic Einsteins for their moments of inspiration and discovery. But much of the real action in science occurs on the sidelines, often years before any wizardry in the lab. Some of is performed by armies of people whose names are mostly unknown. Others are well-known politicians, like President John F. Kennedy declaring the moon shot in 1961, throwing their weight on the levers of history.For many baseball fans, the most exciting part of the game is the so-called hot stove league, now in progress. Here the heroes are crafty general managers who wheel and deal, barter and sign and deploy their players like so many chess pieces. There was Branch Rickey, who integrated Major League Baseball by signing Jackie Robinson and putting him on first base for the Dodgers in 1947, but only after provoking him to make sure he would be strong enough to take the expected abuse without striking back. Recently Theo Epstein has become a front office legend by rebuilding the Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs.It’s the same drama in most professional sports, as anyone who has followed the annual travails of the New York Knicks in their search for a franchise-changing draft pick or a free-agent superstar.So, too, in the hot stove science league.Future Nobel Prizes are won in congressional-committee hearing rooms and on august panels at the National Academy of Sciences, by budget-wielding bureaucrats. Without their efforts, there would be no labs or research grants. This is a point made emphatically by the well-known author Michael Lewis (“The Blind Side,” “Liar’s Poker,” “Moneyball”) in his latest book, “The Fifth Risk,” which tells stories of civil servants in bureaucracies like the Departments of Energy, Commerce and Agriculture working to keep the country’s nuclear arsenal and fleets of weather satellites in shape, and their travails under the Trump administration.This summer the world will pay tribute to the Apollo 11 lunar landing 50 years ago, and to the bravery and skill of astronauts such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. But the man who did as much as anyone to put them up there was James Webb, NASA’s administrator from 1961 to 1968.After a capsule fire killed three astronauts in 1967, Webb took charge of the investigation, setting a standard for the space agency’s warts-and-all frankness, and gave the go-ahead for Apollo 8’s dramatic moon mission during Christmas in 1968. He stepped down in October 1968 just before Richard Nixon’s election, but at least he will have a telescope named for him, the long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, when it finally launches, maybe in 2021.Political, economic, bureaucratic, geographic and historic machinations now at work will determine where the next giant telescope or next big particle collider will be built. Laptop-toting physicists have been crisscrossing the oceans between Japan, China and Europe, for the last decade trying to cajole colleagues and their governments into pouring many billions of dollars into the future of physics. By the time particles start zinging around any such machine, many of these scientists will have retired.As Frederick Bordry, CERN’s director of accelerators, said last year, “I’m working for the young people.”Few people had ever heard of LIGO before February of 2016, when its astronomers announced that they had heard black holes dancing in the dark. The discovery knocked the world on its head, confirming for the first time the existence of gravitational waves, and of those dead pits of space-time, black holes. It also garnered a Nobel Prize for its originators and leaders, Rainer Weiss of M.I.T. and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology.Of course, by then LIGO had been in the works for 30 years, and had already cost the National Science Foundation a billion dollars. Its success was a saga of persistence, ingenuity and just plain bravery in the face of nature and professional skepticism. The twin antennas — at Hanford, Wash., and Livingston, La. — are basically L-shaped tubes of vacuum, empty space. Inside them laser beams monitor the distance between two mirrors 2.5 miles apart, looking for a gravitational wave that will squeeze that distance by less than the diameter of a proton.Convincing anybody that this scheme would work was no small or quick task. The LIGO team owes its Nobel Prize partly to skeptical physicists and astronomers (who didn’t like that a physics experiment was being called an “observatory”) who fought the project tooth and nail, holding its proponents’ feet to the fire in studies and workshops over and over, making them prove that it would work. On Feb. 10, 2016 the world got its answer when LIGO announced they had recorded the collision of a pair of black holes.I sat next to one of those fierce critics, Richard Garwin, a distinguished, influential and well-connected physicist based at IBM, when the Nobel Prize announcement was celebrated at Columbia University. He was beaming with pleasure.Branch Rickey would be proud."
"Can Low-Impact Sports Like Cycling Be Putting Your Bones at Risk? - The New York Times
Could competitive cyclists be putting their bone health at risk?A disquieting new study of bone density in elite cyclists and runners suggests that the answer might be yes. The study found that the cyclists, both male and female, had thinner bones than the runners, even though all of the athletes were young, healthy and enviably fit, and many of the cyclists lifted weights.The results underscore the divergent effects of various sports on our skeletons and also stir a little unease about the long-term impacts of pursuing low-impact exercise at the expense of more high-impact activities.By and large, the available scientific evidence shows that physical activity is desirable and even necessary for bone health. Children who run, hop and play develop thicker, stronger bones than those who remain sedentary, as do teenagers and young adults who participate in sports involving sprinting and leaping.Most scientists agree that these kinds of activities build skeletal strength by generating sudden, sharp forces that minutely bow or deform the affected bones. Such activities jump-start processes within the body that increase the number of bone cells and help to prepare those parts of the skeleton to withstand similar forces in the future.Even middle-aged and older people, who once were thought to face inevitable thinning of their bones with age, can maintain strong skeletons if they are sufficiently active, recent studies show.But which types of exercise bend bones in a desirable way — and which are too gentle — remains uncertain. Some past studies suggest that running generates enough force to remodel bone, while other experiments with runners conclude the opposite. Ditto with weight training. And multiple studies have raised concerns about negligible or even adverse effects from non — weight-bearing exercises, such as cycling and swimming, which put little pressure on bones.In hopes of gaining more clarity about sports and bones, researchers at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the Norwegian Olympic Training Center, in Oslo, decided to look closely at the skeletons of world-class, competitive cyclists and runners.They focused on elite, full-time athletes in large part because the athletes’ heavy training could be expected to amplify any impacts from and differences between the two sports.They wound up recruiting 21 high-level runners and 19 road cyclists, men and women, most of them in their 20s and all of them lean, fit and with several years of intense competition behind them.The athletes reported to a lab, where scientists measured their body composition, with particular focus on the density of their bones, both over all and in their lower spines and the tops of their femurs — portions of the skeleton that can indicate general bone health.The researchers also asked the athletes about their training, health and calcium intake and whether they spent much time in the gym. The latter question was of particular interest to the researchers, since weight training often is recommended to athletes in sports like cycling to bulk up their bones, as well as their muscles.The scientists then compared data. Some of the differences between athletes were substantial, if expected. The cyclists trained far more than the runners, for instance, averaging about 900 hours a year in the saddle, versus about 500 annual hours on the road or treadmills for the runners.The cyclists also did more weight training, with most of them heading to the gym during their off-season for intense lifting. None of the runners did that.The athletes in both sports consumed enough calcium to meet their expected daily requirements.But they had noticeably different bones.The cyclists, as a group, all had thinner bones than the runners, and more than half of them met medical criteria for low bone mineral density in some portion of their skeleton. One of the riders, a man, displayed clinical osteoporosis in his spine.These results are potentially worrisome, says Oddbjorn Klomsten Andersen, a graduate student at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and a former national-team cyclist himself, who led the study, which was published in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine.“There are limited studies following young cyclists through their careers,” he says. “But studies in master cyclists demonstrate that a larger proportion of them have low bone mineral density or osteoporosis” than people who do not cycle.This study cannot tell us, though, why cyclists’ bones might be thin, he adds. They could have been eating too little or sweating too much for ideal bone health. Both low calorie intake and high rates of calcium loss through sweating have been tied to bone loss in other studies.More surprising, the cyclists’ heavy weight training seems not to have built much bone.But, as Mr. Andersen points out, this was a one-time snapshot of the athletes’ health. It’s possible, he says, that weight training prevented even greater bone thinning.It is also encouraging, he says, that the runners harbored relatively healthy bones, since some past studies have hinted that running might not stimulate bone building.Over all, the study’s findings suggest that serious cyclists might want to consider at least sometimes branching out, Mr. Andersen says.“I would generally recommend combining cycling with weight-bearing exercise to promote good bone health,” he says."

"Get Ready for Olympic Break Dancing - The New York Times
The archetype of the Olympian is evolving, as evidenced by the potential arrival of a new sort of athletic competitor at the Summer Games: B-boys and B-girls.As part of an effort to appeal to younger fans, the organizing committee for the 2024 Games in Paris announced on Thursday that it would recommend break dancing — yes, the street dance form with moves like flares, headspins and windmills — as a new sport to be added to its program.The proposal — which also includes a recommendation that skateboarding, surfing and climbing, which will be introduced next year at the Tokyo Games, remain on the program — will be formally presented to the International Olympic Committee executive board at the end of March. The I.O.C. is not expected to confirm the events program for the 2024 Games until December 2020.Break dancing was enthusiastically received when it made its debut at the Youth Olympic Games last summer in Buenos Aires. The eventual medalists there hailed from Russia, France, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Italy, Austria, Vietnam and Argentina — a vivid sign perhaps of how extensively the activity has spread since its beginnings decades ago in New York City.“Breaking has two elements,” Nakari Shigeyuki, a Japanese teenager known as Shigekix who won a bronze medal at the Youth event, told Olympic.org in October. “One is sports, and one is arts. We need the stamina of athletes, but we also need to be artists, and express our feelings.”The sport’s potential moment in the global spotlight arrives as the I.O.C. continues its efforts to engage new fans — particularly young ones — in a sports landscape flowering with alternatives to the traditional Olympic program.To that end, the I.O.C. created new rules recently to allow host cities to recommend new sports for the Olympics program. Organizers for the 2020 Games in Toyko proposed baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, which the I.O.C. eventually approved. (Because host city recommendations are valid for one Olympic Games only, karate and baseball/softball will not return in Paris.)Paris 2024 organizers said their aim was to include “sports that can be shared on social media, sports that are a means of getting around, forms of expression, lifestyles in their own right, sports that are practiced every day, in the street and elsewhere.”The organizers said their values led them to “sustainable and socially responsible” sports that do not require permanent facilities; sports that will engage young people and those in urban communities; and sports that are culturally relevant to France.Another initiative in that vein will be the opportunity for amateurs to run the Olympic marathon course after the official race has ended (which is, in essence, how most major marathons in the world operate, with a group of professional competitors preceding a larger, amateur field).In their break dancing proposal, Paris 2024 organizers said there would be men’s and women’s events with a total of 32 athletes who would officially be referred to as B-boys and B-girls.The competitions, meanwhile, would be referred to as “battles” and feature dancers taking turns performing dance moves and spins on the floor. Each routine would be graded, the organizers said, on criteria “such as technique, variety, performance, musicality, creativity and personality.”"
"Italian Alpine Spas, Where Sports Are an Afterthought - The New York Times
A paradise for skiers, the Italian Alps of South Tyrol offer a more placid pastime that’s surging anew. A host of spas are sprouting up in isolated tracts among the highlands, and though there’s hiking, biking and access to some of the Alps’ easier ski slopes, sports are a mere afterthought here. The spas draw skiers and nonskiers alike to spend days soaking in hot tubs, besotted by the view of these commanding, ice-shrouded peaks.Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, when mineral springs became Europe’s cure-all for medical ills, wellness seekers flocked to the region’s famous waters and sanitariums. Today’s alpine spas are updating this long tradition as the present-day search for wellness has reinvigorated the desire for their timeless sedative effects.For those of us who have forgotten what a multitude of stars looks like, the Italian Alps offer an immersion into lost wonders of contemporary life. Untrammeled snow. Unsullied air. A velvet cloak of silence. And the immeasurable reprieve of poor cellphone receptions.It’s little surprise that these mountains have become the locus of a cluster of modern spa destinations designed to draw city dwellers to a place where tranquillity imposes itself by the very nature of the landscape.In December, I headed to the Alps to see how these age-old cures stood up to our high-intensity era of stress and self-care, visiting four contemporary spas set amid the summits of Italy’s South Tyrol region.These spa hotels are dramatically modern, with bold architecture and cutting-edge restaurants. Their pools, saunas and hot tubs are designed for a forward-looking aesthetic and include outdoor heated pools that allow visitors to enjoy the mountain views alfresco, even when surrounded by snow. Though the look is up-to-date, the cures — hot soaks, massages, mountain air — are classic, and beckon a new generation in search of health and relaxation.In their heyday, spas were metropolitan affairs, situated in cities like Merano. Health-seekers flocked to them for their restorative waters and for the society they provided at the theaters, casinos and dance halls that were common resort amenities.In ancient times, the bathhouses that the Romans adapted from the Greek tradition were even more integral to cosmopolitan life. There were 952 bathhouses in Rome by 354 A.D.; they often included libraries, gyms, lecture halls, medical treatment facilities and gardens. The Baths of Diocletian alone accommodated up to 3,000 visitors at a time.Today bathhouses are rare on our city maps, and serenity is a luxury reserved for infrequent vacations. Spas now must be deep in the woods, the dislocation and the staggering view of the mountains the only way to finally subdue us.Modern Alpine spa resorts reimagine the mountains’ traditional wooden huts as lofty architectural temples of repose. On the sprawling plateau of the Alpe di Siusi in the Dolomites, set upon a grassland slope dotted with diminutive log cabins, the Adler Mountain Lodge mirrors the rustic little dwellings of its neighbors, but in palatial form. Built in the raw timber of local spruce trees, the double-gabled main hotel and a dozen surrounding chalets for rent are fronted by full glass walls, offering an awe-inspiring gaze at the serrated monoliths of the Sassopiatto and Sassolungo mountains, which rise like spiky arrowheads to lance the sky.To pull back the morning curtains on this jagged expanse — the rocky massifs jangling in the bright sun or softened by fields of fresh falling snow — is to wake up to the grandeur of the greater world that, in our insular daily lives, we so easily forget.Of course, the mountain views are just the beginning. There is a spa. A saltwater, womb-warm pool, constructed of the local silvery quartzite rock and filled by a nearby spring, extends from inside to out, where steam rises off the surface into the chilly air as visitors bob and recline, enveloped in Jacuzzi bubbles as they contemplate the horizon’s mammoth stony outcroppings. Two pinewood saunas, one filled with Tyrolean hay and its sharp, dry-earth perfume, offer panoramic views of the rough-chiseled topography. In the saunas — as in all the saunas of this area — genders are mingled and nude or lightly wrapped in towels. But as long as you’re comfortable glimpsing bare bodies, the personal sensation of simmering your own swimsuit-free body is, frankly, worth it.Adler’s spa offers a post-excursion massage using Alpine arnica extract and mud to soothe overexerted legs, but no one seems to be in a great stink to get sporty here. There are options, though: The area offers a paradise for hikers, electric bikes are available in the summer and you can ski right out of the locker-room door onto mountain paths in the winter. The trails are wide and easy, and guests generally hit the slopes for a couple of hours at most. “Our slopes are good for cruising and enjoying the view,” says Nicol Lobis, a staff member at Adler Mountain Lodge. “But people come here to relax, not to burn their thighs to the max on black diamond slopes.” And besides, the bar is open all day.For all its healthy overtones, Adler is an all-inclusive resort, serving up plentiful, thrice-daily meals and snacks in between. An all-hours bread and cheese buffet, like the well-stocked bar, is self-serve, giving the stay a decidedly more indulgent slant.The restaurant’s dishes reflect South Tyrol’s unique history. A territory of Austria until World War I, the region’s primary language is still German; and smoked fish, caraway seeds, horseradish, beets and the very distinctive taste of milk thistle oil mark its cuisine as more Central European than Mediterranean, despite belonging to Italy for the last century. Yet the Adler dedicates Italian-style special attention to superbly high-quality local ingredients.The hotel opened in 2014 and was the first resort of its kind in this Arcadian area of the Alpe di Siusi, which, as part of the Unesco-protected Dolomites, allows only a handful of cars and even fewer building developments.In Italy’s Alps, the modern movement of forest spas launched with the opening of the Vigilius Resort in 2003. Designed by the renowned architect Matteo Thun, the hotel is a starkly contemporary expanse of glass and lumber 5,000 feet up the mountainside, reachable only by cable car. In its first years, the Vigilius won awards for its sustainable energy approach and introduced the idea of the eco resort to the area, setting the bar for subsequent spas’ natural material use and extreme energy efficiency. The Vigilius’s glass-fronted sauna and indoor-outdoor heated pool immerse visitors in a dramatically dense view of larch trees and craggy peaks, but the resort is in need of a refresh to keep up with the high style introduced by more recent eco resorts in the vicinity.Atop the isolated Avelengo plateau visible on a mountaintop opposite the Vigilius, the San Luis Retreat Hotel & Lodges is a collection of modern chalets and “tree houses” on stilts, all splayed on a meadow around a central lake, with hills of larch trees rising behind. There are no rooms at this hotel; instead, there are individual cabins of one or two floors, with rosy exteriors of aged, untreated wood that face the water and the nighttime fire pits along its piers. Their hardwood interiors pair polished modern interpretations of farmhouse furniture with a crackling fireplace, a private hot tub on the deck and a sauna with a panoramic glass wall, so guests can enjoy spa time in solitude — perhaps the most romantic setup of the resorts in South Tyrol.“Everyone lives in cities, but they all dream of a house in the woods,” said Ilse Meister, who, along with her husband and two grown children, launched the San Luis spa resort in 2015, a countryside complement to the urban Hotel Irma that the family has run in Merano for generations. “We were convinced that in the future, the thing that would be most important for our guests would be total silence.”As evening falls amid the dimly lit cabins, the only sounds are the occasional bather languidly splashing in the burbling Jacuzzi, and the soft popcorn snaps of newly lit fires, as the last sun rays fade behind the delicate, silhouetted web of pine branches surrounding the ridge. Chimney smoke and the balsamic pitch of evergreen needles scent the clean breeze. At the center of the grounds, a soaring wood-beam lodge — the candle-filled main hall — contains the dining room of the full-board (excluding alcohol) hotel and its main sauna and steam room. A fireplace marks the heart of the glassed-in, gabled-roof barn that holds the heated pool, which opens to an outdoor pool and a Jacuzzi perched on a pier in the middle of the lake, its warm vapors swirling and rising into brisk evening air.There are no cold-plunge pools here, or seemingly anywhere in South Tyrol — surprising, as the ancient Romans themselves were great practitioners of hot/cold immersion therapy, a practice continued today in many bathing cultures. A frigid shower after the sweat of the sauna will never induce the dazzling, purifying tingle of a full icy dunk: a stupefying feeling that your entire body is mentholated, a trick that keeps you warm through wintry days.But at the San Luis, you can improvise with a bracing roll in the snow (tried and recommended) or a leap in the lake, depending on the season; and the chalets’ big, free-standing baths can be adapted for cold immersion after partaking of the personal sauna and hot tub (also recommended).A short car ride away, the Hotel Miramonti is “a mountain hotel in the city,” says Klaus Alber, who opened it in 2016 with his wife, Carmen. It’s distinctly more urban than the other Alpine spa resorts, but its position — secluded on a promontory 4,000 feet above Merano, along a steep country road winding past apple orchards, flocks of grazing mountain goats, a lovely 14th-century Romanesque church and antique castles — is still detached from the hustle and bustle seen vertiginously below.The red fir lumber exterior of the boutique hotel’s triple-peaked lodge mirrors the mountains across the Merano valley, a majestic palisade of zigzagging, snow-crowned geometry at the sky’s edge that’s visible from each of the hotel’s weathered wood balconies. The rooms — of which the lofts are the coziest — are fitted with raw planks of oak and fir as at the other resorts, but contrasted here with stark white walls and minimalist Scandinavian furniture from Copenhagen’s &Tradition brand; more urban design hotel than chic chalet.Merano, its illuminated tangle of city streets visible straight down the hotel’s front cliff, is just a 15-minute drive away, and guests often descend for dinner or a day trip. Yet the Miramonti, built on porphyry rock amid a thicket of trees, still has miles of woodland paths just out its back door, and the Merano 2000 ski slopes are a short shuttle ride away.Set a few steps outside the hotel’s lodge, an elevated pinewood and glass cabin — Miramonti’s forest sauna — allows guests to enjoy Finnish heat while surveying the surrounding copse of firs and the mountain crests in the distance. A hot tub is tucked into nearby bushes. Smart, ash-gray linen recliners line the indoor and outdoor observation deck with a view over the valley. But this slickly modern spa shines brightest with its design-forward, photo-ready outdoor infinity pool, partially covered by a pitched cottage roof and jutting out to seemingly hover above the precipice. Floating at the water’s edge, with the city beneath silenced by its remoteness, the pool’s projection offers a vantage point of quiet calm; the hushed, hulking mountains seem to be all yours.What does it take to relax these days? As the stresses of work, life and the modern world pile up, perhaps we ought, like Romans, to let our heads float in womb-like bubbles more often.At the San Luis, I tried a massage, although days of spas had — I thought — already rendered my body the tender consistency of a jellyfish. Yet the masseuse paused as her fingertips alighted on my spine. “Do you spend a lot of time working at a desk?” Well, yes.She kneaded a constellation of unexpected knots around my shoulder blades, clucking that everyone she saw these days had the same condition. “You need a massage once a week, or you’ll damage your back.” Need, she told me. Need. Did the Romans, with their weekly spa-time and scheduled self-care, have knots in their backs? Perhaps the masseuse is right. Need indeed.Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

"Ja Rule Enters the Realm of Billy Goats, Campbell’s Soup and Lil B - The New York Times
Sports curses come in all shapes and sizes. They can involve livestock, soup commercials, magazine covers and, frequently, the selling of star players.In recent years, the rapper Lil B has made a name for himself in the sports realm with his curses — most notably on James Harden of the Houston Rockets — but it appears he has some new competition: the rapper Ja Rule.It all started on Saturday, when Ja Rule was performing at halftime of a game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the host Milwaukee Bucks.The performance came on the 17th anniversary of Ja Rule’s collaboration with Ashanti, “Always Be On Time,” hitting No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. But the show came under criticism immediately because of a somewhat misleading video of the crowd reaction and another one showing an unexpected guest: Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks’ star forward, who came out to begin warming up for the second half while Ja Rule was still performing on the court along with a group of dancers.The rapper initially shrugged off the criticism, but his tone changed when the Timberwolves decided to mock the performance on social media. In a post to Twitter, the team said “We too were hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!” The post was a reference to an earlier post by Ja Rule about his role in the ill-fated Fyre Festival, a luxury music event in the Bahamas that failed spectacularly in 2017. The rapper was not amused.The potential effects of this particular curse are unclear, though. The Timberwolves have existed as a franchise for 30 seasons and not only have not won a championship, but they have only made it out of the first round of the playoffs once — in 2004. They are 28-31, putting them just outside legitimate playoff contention, and the notion that Karl-Anthony Towns is departing anytime soon — as Ja Rule suggested with “AND KAT IS LEAVING!!!” — seems unlikely, as he has signed a five-year contract extension that kicks in next year and guarantees him nearly $160 million.Of course, logic does not have to play a role in sports curses. The Chicago Cubs endured the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat for more than 70 years after the team asked the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, William Sianis, to leave a game because his goat was bothering fans. That the team had not won a World Series in more than 30 years before the episode was treated as mostly irrelevant. Other popular curses have included one in which the athletes endorsing Campbell’s Chunky Soup seemed to become injured at an extraordinary rate. Another claimed that athletes had their performance fall off after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated.The most famous, of course, is the Curse of the Bambino, which doomed the Boston Red Sox to lose after selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in December 1919. The jinx is credited by some with keeping the Red Sox from winning a World Series for 86 years, despite the first year of that stretch coming before the team sold Ruth, and the fact that the curse was barely mentioned in popular culture before George Vecsey wrote a column about it for The New York Times in 1986. Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe also wrote a book in 1990 that popularized the phrase.At the very least, the talk of Ja Rule’s curse was good news for Lil B, who spent part of the weekend trending on Twitter. He celebrated by retweeting various people saying Ja Rule was simply stealing a tactic that Lil B had already perfected."
"For Women Working in Men’s Sports, It Is Not an Honor Just to Be Nominated - The New York Times
The hiring of the W.N.B.A. point guard Kristi Toliver as a full-time assistant coach with the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards while she is still an active player was widely applauded as a notable new achievement for women in coaching.It followed the San Antonio Spurs’ hiring of Becky Hammon, and other women like Nancy Lieberman and Jenny Boucek also joining N.B.A. coaching staffs.“With anything, you need to see it to be it,” said Briann January, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury and, in her off-season, an assistant women’s basketball coach at Arizona State. “I see it now because of Becky. Because of Kristi. I see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional area.”For many players, the moves showed N.B.A. teams tapping into a longstanding, significant pipeline of female talent.“I think a lot of women in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunities in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team, to any organization, no matter our gender,” said Alana Beard, a veteran Los Angeles Sparks guard often mentioned as a coaching candidate by her peers.Beard cited the meager pay Toliver is to receive this season — just $10,000 because of limits in the W.N.B.A.’s collective bargaining agreement — as an “extremely important” issue for the league to address in negotiations for a new agreement. The goal would be making a barrier that has long been permeable on one side — men into women’s basketball on the coaching side — into a free exchange of talent, regardless of gender, based on opportunity.Many, if not most, W.N.B.A. players, who are paid significantly less than their male counterparts, cannot afford to spend their off-season working for so little pay. Their basketball skills are worth much more — into the millions of dollars — in service of women’s leagues overseas.“All of those things on a coach’s plate to take care of, to do that for $10,000 for an entire N.B.A. season is crazy,” January said. “I’d like to break that down and do the math, like how much that is a game or how much that is a day. That would just be insult to injury.”Yet some people, including commentators on internet sites and men’s basketball fans in real life, contend these women should be happy to have opportunities at all.This attitude rankles many W.N.B.A. players — that even Toliver’s shot, let alone chances for other women with considerable experience playing and in many cases coaching, is often thought of as a one-sided benefit for those who are hired.But in many cases, the N.B.A. came calling after seeing the women excelling on their own. Toliver’s work with the Mystics helped bring her to the attention of Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, just as Hammon got her opportunity in San Antonio because she was employed by the Silver Stars, then owned by the same group as the Spurs, and her W.N.B.A. coach, Dan Hughes, talked her up to Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.“I had a chance to put two parties together that I knew would work,” Hughes, now the head coach of the Seattle Storm, said. “I knew Becky, and I also knew Pop, and I knew that Pop, we had a lot of years of conversation about Becky. He had seen her play when I first brought her to San Antonio. So to me it was an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each other.”Toliver has opened up that discussion in significant ways, which she said was a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place. In Hughes’s eyes, it is nothing less than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia has prevented the men’s basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the women’s side of the sport, the next step toward N.B.A. teams and W.N.B.A. teams and men’s and women’s college basketball programs all hiring from the same pool of candidates.As Hughes sees it, it’s time, not because these women deserve a chance, but because every basketball team needs more coaches like Hammon, Toliver and those who will follow.“I want a world someday where people judge coaches on how good a coach they truly are,” Hughes said. “Doesn’t matter if they’re male or female, doesn’t matter their background. They can say he’s a coach or she’s a coach, and we can use them.”Every W.N.B.A. player who stays home instead of playing overseas in her off-season, the athletes said, is potentially one more person around which to promote the league year-round, and that player gets to rest, too. The grind of playing 12 months a year has led to W.N.B.A. players like Diana Taurasi and Angel McCoughtry taking seasons off.“You always want to protect your product,” January said. “And the majority of our product is being run down and beaten up year-round playing this game. So when they come back around to play in the W.N.B.A., you have half of your players injured, playing through nagging things. We still find a way to have a high talent and high level of basketball, which is crazy to me.“We just have some really strong women, but that needs to be a discussion. What can we do to provide other opportunities for women to make income and prepare for the future on a real-life scale? Something they can live on. Something that makes sense.”"
"Bribes and Big-Time Sports: U.S.C. Finds Itself, Once Again, Facing Scandal - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — On the palm-tree-lined campus of the University of Southern California this week, a tour guide proudly pointed out to prospective students the university’s six Heisman football trophies and award-winning faculty, testaments to the stellar reputation the school has fought hard to build.Yet only a day earlier, U.S.C. had emerged at the epicenter of an unfolding college admissions scandal involving federal charges of bribery, cheating and parents who were willing to pay thousands of dollars to get their underperforming children into some of the nation’s top universities.Of the nearly three dozen parents named in court documents unveiled this week, more than half are accused of bribing their way into the elite private campus in the heart of Los Angeles. Four U.S.C. athletics officials are charged with taking bribes, more than the number named at any other school. Donna Heinel, one of the university’s top athletics administrators, helped get more than two dozen students admitted as athletes, federal prosecutors charged, though none of them were qualified to play competitive sports.[Read more on the Justice Department’s largest ever college admissions prosecution.]Reeling from what was only the latest scandal to unfold over the past two years, campus officials insisted this week that U.S.C. was a victim in the bribery and cheating case and vowed to reject any applicants involved in fraudulent admissions.Six students who applied for admission this fall were involved in the alleged bribery scheme, officials said, and would be rejected. The university was still investigating how many current students were also implicated.“This will not set us back in any way,” Wanda Austin, the interim president, said in an interview. “We have parents who set a horrible example, and employees who clearly acted in a way that showed they need to be fired.”The campus today is far different from the one students encountered decades ago when the school was better known as a home for the children of Los Angeles’s wealthy elite, snidely referred to as the “University of Spoiled Children.” In the 1990s, the university began an extensive overhaul, building on its reputation as an athletic powerhouse and ranking academically among the nation’s top-tier schools.It recruited star faculty, including six Nobel laureates, and raised standards for admission, admitting last year only 13 percent of those who applied. The campus also made a major investment in its athletic programs, winning national football championships, while also drawing top athletes to play tennis, water polo, volleyball and track.But a series of corruption scandals has torn through the university, threatening those years of image building.In 2017, the medical school dean was fired over accusations of drug use and prostitution, and his successor resigned after allegations of sexual harassment. After yet another scandal emerged in 2018, involving a campus gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct, the university’s president, C.L. Max Nikias, was forced to step down. Then at the end of last year, the dean of the business school was ousted over the mishandling of workplace misconduct claims.How the university built itself up only to be undermined by such profound internal turmoil has left students, parents, faculty and the vast Trojan alumni network wondering whether the university can manage to maintain its stature. It has also prompted many to begin asking: Has the push to raise money to boost the school’s programs gone too far? Is everything at U.S.C. for sale?Josh Meltzer, who graduated in 2002, said he has been alarmed by the “apparently constant lack of ethical and responsible leadership” in the last several years.“U.S.C. prides itself on creating this massive Trojan family and alumni are constantly asked to support the university with donations, but it’s hard to imagine doing that right now,” Mr. Meltzer said. “When I was a freshman I looked around at our class and was proud it certainly wasn’t all rich kids — we were coming from a lot of diverse backgrounds and had done really well in high school.”Ms. Austin has vowed to have more accountability and transparency and said that the school would reject any current applicants who are connected to the bribery scheme. She and others at the campus have expressed shock at the brazen willingness of parents, as described in the charging documents, to subvert the admissions system.In one conversation referred to in the indictment and captured by a wiretap, a Beverly Hills marketing executive, Jane Buckingham, discussed how to get her son into U.S.C. with William Singer, the admissions counselor who has pleaded guilty to organizing the bribery and cheating scheme. She admitted that it was a reach.“I need you to get him into U.S.C., and then I need you to cure cancer and [make peace] in the Middle East,” Ms. Buckingham said.“I can do that,” Mr. Singer replied.[Read the full list of who has been charged here.]Yet even the chairman of the university’s board of trustees, Rick J. Caruso, a Los Angeles real estate developer, emerged with a personal connection: As prosecutors announced that the Hollywood star Lori Loughlin was being charged with bribing her daughter’s way into U.S.C., the daughter was on Mr. Caruso’s yacht, sharing a spring break vacation in the Bahamas with Mr. Caruso’s daughter.“My daughter and a group of students left for spring break prior to the government’s announcement yesterday,” Mr. Caruso said in a statement. “Once we became aware of the investigation, the young woman decided it would be in her best interest to return home.”The bribery allegations, he said, were “just unthinkable.”Mark Piccirillo, who was visiting the campus from Dallas this week with his daughter, a high school junior, said he was disappointed but not surprised to learn about the bribes. He said the case affirmed his long-held belief that the system was rigged in favor of the rich and privileged.“The one thing that bothers me about the whole thing is it’s hard enough to get in regularly,” he said. “My guess is this is the tip of the iceberg.”The center of the scandal swirled around the school’s athletics department, which over the years has been the most visible way the school presents itself to the world. As the bribery case made clear, the system to recruit student athletes — who are already sometimes held to lesser academic standards than other students — can be subject to manipulation.“The fact that there is this entirely separate system for athletes’ admission and recruitment that frankly lends itself to corruption and abuse is really disturbing,” said Ariela Gross, a law professor at the university. “There’s the broader class issue of wealthy people buying access or stacking the deck in normal, legal ways.”At one time, there was no better symbol of the renaissance at U.S.C. than the football team.The Trojans, behind a charismatic coach, Pete Carroll, eagerly filled the professional football void left in Los Angeles by the departure of the Rams and the Raiders.Mr. Carroll, who was hired in 2000, built a juggernaut, winning 45 of 46 games at one point with teams that were as entertaining as they were dominating, routinely packing the cavernous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.As the building boom in and around campus took root, investment continued in athletics, which, thanks to football’s rejuvenation, had seen revenues double to $76 million over an eight-year period. A long-awaited basketball arena, a state-of-the-art tennis stadium and a glistening new administration building were built, fortifying programs like water polo, tennis and track and field, which continued to chase national championships and produce a steady stream of Olympians.But football was hit by its own recruitment scandal nearly a decade ago.The team’s stars back then were treated as such, receiving the Hollywood treatment.Snoop Dogg hovered near the end zone during games and ran pass patterns at practice. Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx and Spike Lee stood along the sidelines, regularly flanked by professional athletes.But it came crumbling down in 2010 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association, after a clumsy, contentious and lengthy investigation into whether football and basketball players had received illegal gifts from agents, hit the school with crippling penalties.The university moved swiftly to recover. Mr. Nikias succeeded Steven B. Sample as president that same year and began building the school into a fund-raising powerhouse. For the last several years, it has been one of the top universities in annual fund-raising, along with Harvard and Stanford, raising $6 billion in a recent campaign.Mr. Nikias used the N.C.A.A. sanctions as the impetus to clean house — firing the athletic director, Mike Garrett, himself a former Heisman Trophy winner. Mr. Nikias also beefed up the rules compliance office, hiring a prominent Los Angeles lawyer, and soon had a nine-person staff.“We’re going to have a culture of compliance,” Pat Haden, the replacement U.S.C. athletic director, told The New York Times at the time. “We’re going to think about it in the morning, think about it before we go to bed. We’re going to have issues but we’ll fess up and be better than the way before.”As part of the restructuring, one administrator was soon thrust into a more prominent role — Ms. Heinel, a former college swimmer.Ms. Heinel now stands accused of collecting more than $1.3 million in payments directed from parents through Mr. Singer between 2014 and 2018, and drawing $20,000 per month from Mr. Singer since last July through a sham consultant agreement.Ms. Heinel, who came to U.S.C. in 2003, was fired Tuesday along with Jovan Vavic, the hugely successful water polo coach who was charged in the current affidavit with accepting $250,000 from Mr. Singer. Two former U.S.C. soccer coaches — Ali Khosroshahin and his assistant, Laura Janke — have been charged with taking $350,000 from Mr. Singer. So, too, has Bill Ferguson, the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, who led the men’s team at U.S.C. for a decade before leaving in 2016. He is accused of accepting $100,000 from Mr. Singer.The recent scandals haven’t appeared to dim the university’s powerful lure for prospective students. This year, U.S.C. received close to 66,000 applicants, its largest pool ever, with the highest collective grade point averages and SAT scores ever recorded.Yet in the aftermath of the latest news, many faculty and students said they felt betrayed and angered.“I’m infuriated by what happened and what she did,” said Tom Walsh, a former U.S.C. track and cross-country coach, who left in 2013 after 19 years at the school, referring to Ms. Heinel. “I felt like our program, we got denied a few people that we thought were going to get into our program, legit track and field international stars. Now, you look back and wonder why they didn’t get in. Did they make space for these phony people?”Summer Dahlquist-Tookey, 18, a freshman, said that for her, the indictments had only underscored the role money played in the admissions process. “From the moment I stepped onto U.S.C.’s campus, I noticed how wealthy most of the students were,” she said. “I have classmates who have the same last names as buildings on campus. Once we hear that, we basically know how they got in.”"
"NHL Embraces More Betting, Joins With 3rd Gambling Operator - The New York Times
OXON HILL, Md. — The NHL entered its third partnership in six months with a gambling operator on Thursday, another step in its embrace of business opportunities that come with legal sports betting.The league announced the deal with William Hill shortly before Commissioner Gary Bettman spoke at a sports gambling summit organized by the American Gaming Association, a casino-industry trade group. Last fall, the NHL announced partnerships with MGM and FanDuel.Bettman had been a staunch defender of the federal law that limited single-game sports betting to Nevada, and he had also been skeptical about NHL fans' level of interest in gambling. But since the Supreme Court struck down that law last May, allowing any state to authorize sports gambling, he has embraced the change enthusiastically, and he now speaks proudly about a 38 percent increase in bets on NHL games at William Hill's Nevada sports books this season.""Once the Supreme Court ruled, you've got to get with the program,"" Bettman said. ""You have to evolve, you have to innovate and you have to be relevant.""Sports betting is now legal in eight states, and William Hill runs sports books in Nevada, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The deal with the NHL will allow William Hill to advertise at arenas and on the league's online and mobile platforms.As of now, William Hill has not agreed to pay the NHL for access to its proprietary data. The NHL is developing a system to track player and puck movement through microchips worn by the players and embedded in the pucks. Bettman believes the new data will lend itself to in-game betting opportunities.One data point valued by gamblers that the league has no plans to disclose is more detailed information on player injuries.""Most of the injury data affects whether or not a player is going to play. Our guys probably play injured more than in any other sport, and we don't see any reason to subject them to any further injury risk,"" Bettman said. ""We're transparent about not being transparent.""___"
"Gladbach to Part Ways With Coach Hecking at Season End - The New York Times
BERLIN — Borussia Moenchengladbach and coach Dieter Hecking will go their separate ways at the end of the season, the Bundesliga club said on Tuesday, a year before his contract finishes.Sports director Max Eberl said it was a strategic decision and had nothing to do with the team's form. They have dropped to fifth in the league, having won one of their last seven matches, and are two points off the Champions League spots.""I informed Dieter already on Monday,"" Eberl told reporters. ""It is a decision I took as sports director which has a strategic nature. It is a decision for the good of the club. It has nothing to do with the current sporting situation.""The 54-year-old Hecking has been in charge since 2016 and his contract at Gladbach ran to 2020.""The team is playing extremely well despite the recent results which are not good. I would be happy to leave having secured a Champions League spot,"" Hecking said.""Such decisions are never easy. That is why it was a big disappointment yesterday and it has lasted until today.

"Judge Opens the Door to More Compensation for College Athletes - The New York Times
A federal judge on Friday, in a closely watched case, opened the way for college football and basketball players to receive more compensation than they do now, but narrowly limited the benefits to expenses “related to education.”The ruling was somewhat of a victory for the athletes but fell well short of their goal of eliminating the N.C.A.A.’s cap on their compensation, which the organization has argued is vital to maintaining a semblance of amateurism in college sports.In the ruling in Federal District Court in Oakland, Calif., Judge Claudia Wilken determined that amateurism rules barring payment beyond scholarships and certain related costs of education violate antitrust law.Schools, she said, can compensate athletes for education-related expenses such as postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad, and computers and musical instruments. Individual conferences could cap these payments.But in a ruling of more than 100 pages, Judge Wilken also supported the N.C.A.A.’s claim that students should not become professionals while playing for school teams.“The court does credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sports and professional sports,” she said in Friday’s ruling. “In addition to the fact that college sports are played by students actually attending the college, student-athletes are not paid the very large salaries that characterize the professional sports leagues that many student-athletes aspire to.”Still, rather than settle the matter, the decision seemed likely to continue the debate. She stayed the ruling pending appeals.Jeffrey Kessler, a prominent sports lawyer who represented the college athletes, a group of football and basketball players, called the ruling a win, while acknowledging that it stopped short of his clients’ full goals.“It’s just going be a big step forward, and not the full bringing down of the edifice,” he said.The ruling, he added, “will create a whole litany of benefits for the athletes.”“And as I say, that’s terrific,” he continued. “We had hoped we could get an even greater opening of the market. But as I said, one step at a time.”In a statement, the N.C.A.A.’s counsel, Donald Remy, said the association would “explore our next steps.” In tightly limiting her ruling, he said, the judge clearly acknowledged that “college sports should be played by student-athletes, not by paid professionals.”“The decision,” he added, “acknowledges that the popularity of college sports stems in part from the fact that these athletes are indeed students, who must not be paid unlimited cash sums unrelated to education.” He also noted that “the court rejected the plaintiffs’ desire for a free-market system.”Several years ago, a federal appeals court, in overturning Judge Wilken in a previous case, allowed college athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses in video games and other media, but limited the amounts.In a sign of her wrestling with the issue, Judge Wilken signaled she might endorse another way, in which the N.C.A.A. might allow colleges to reward athletes’ academic progress financially, up to the value currently permitted for performance-related bonuses. (For instance, the N.C.A.A. allows championship rings worth no more than a few hundred dollars each.) This, Mr. Kessler suggested, could be a way to annually get thousands of dollars more to athletes.The players had asked Judge Wilken to bar the N.C.A.A. from restricting pay to athletes outright, letting individual conferences set any limits. Failing that, they wanted her to uncap certain bonuses that athletes are allowed to be paid.Judge Wilken rebuffed these requests.She did so while brushing aside many of the college sports establishment’s cherished arguments in favor of amateurism. The notion that paying college athletes more decreases demand for college sports, she said, was belied by the plaintiffs’ expert testimony as well as the fact that college athletes have been paid thousands of dollars more in the past few years — partly thanks to her ruling in the previous case — without affecting ratings and interest.She also acknowledged the stark economic reality that advocates for players frequently cite: that “the extraordinary revenues that defendants derive from these sports” demonstrate that capping players’ compensation at scholarships and related costs “is not commensurate with the value that they create.”"
"Tiger, GolfTV Announce Series of Head-To-Head Matches - The New York Times
Tiger Woods is taking his match-play prowess on the road -- again -- in a series of head-to-head matches set to stream on GolfTV's over-the-top (OTT) platforms, according to Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav.Zaslav announced the news on Wednesday while speaking at the CAA World Congress of Sports at Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point, Calif., and said one match is already planned for Tokyo and most will take place outside of the United States.No timeline was given for when the matches will begin.""Tiger is going to decide what is the best format,"" Zaslav said. ""Should it be one-on-one? Two-on-two? Should we have two matches going on at the same time? But he's all in.""GolfTV was announced last year as part of a long-term partnership between Discovery and the PGA Tour. In November 2018, Discovery secured a multi-year deal with Woods to provide exclusive content for the international streaming service, which launched in January.Zaslav cited Woods' made-for-TV spectacle, ""The Match,"" with Phil Mickelson last Thanksgiving weekend as inspiration for the GolfTV series. The event, hosted by Turner Sports as a pay-per-view event on its B/R Live platform, logged 750,000 unique users.""We looked at it and said, ‘(That's) pretty interesting,'"" he said. ""One million people came in and wanted to watch it -- could we improve on it? What could we do? So, we're going to do a number of those type events (and) Tiger's excited about it.""Woods lost to Denmark's Lucas Bjerregaard in the quarterfinals of last week's WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas. His next Tour start will be next week's Masters, where Woods will go for his fifth green jacket and first since 2005.--Field Level Media"
"The N.C.A.A. Lost in Court, but Athletes Didn’t Win, Either - The New York Times
If the opinion published Friday night in a landmark college sports antitrust case were a novel, then its villain would be the N.C.A.A.In a novella-length 104-page opinion, United States District Court Judge Claudia Wilken criticizes, berates, even mocks the N.C.A.A. for its refusal to allow colleges to compensate players for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related costs of attendance, all in the name of something they call amateurism.“Defendants nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumers insist upon,” said Wilken, referring to the N.C.A.A. and several of its richest, most prominent conferences.Even if they had, Wilken continued, she pointed to numerous exceptions when players could, effectively, be paid. Players are paid, beyond scholarships, all the time: in untold millions of dollars invested in training facilities; in gifts for participating in bowl games; in funds available to purchase loss-of-value insurance.“The rules that permit, limit or forbid student-athlete compensation and benefits do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism,” she said.The decision stems from a long-running case in which a group of college athletes sued the N.C.A.A. and 11 athletic conferences that participate in the top levels of basketball and football. They contended that the ruling bodies of college sports had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limits the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their universities. The N.C.A.A. and the conferences argue that those limits are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sports and undergraduate education.In her decision, Wilken seems to say that those rules “did restrain trade,” producing “significant anticompetitive effects.”“The clerk,” Wilken added on the final page, with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement, “shall enter judgment for the Plaintiff class.”So why doesn’t it feel as if the group of athletes who pursued the litigation to end the N.C.A.A.’s rule won the case? Why did they and their star sports labor lawyer Jeffrey Kessler not get the outcome they most fervently sought?Despite finding that the N.C.A.A. was violating federal law, Wilken turned away the plaintiffs’ main proposed remedy, which was also the logical one: to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation. That means the continuation of a status quo where so many players feel they are working basically for free. How’s that?“When you apply a uniquely muddled set of laws to a unique industry, this is the kind of ruling you get,” said Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane’s sports law program and teaches antitrust law (the unique muddle to which he was referring).The upshot of Friday’s ruling, pending a likely appeal, is that the N.C.A.A. may continue to cap payments to athletes after all — with the limited exception of expenses that are educational in nature. Think computers, or costs related to internships, or postgraduate scholarships.Don’t think: stipends of $1,000, or $10,000, or $100,000, because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sales, and media exposure and television rights payments.No wonder several of the defendants responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one does not expect from parties that technically lost a case.The decision “reaffirms the fundamental principles of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism,” Pacific-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. “Student-athletes are first and foremost students, who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life, while also pursuing athletic excellence.”(Scott’s statement is more aspirational than descriptive: There are basketball players who conclude their college careers before finishing even a year of college.)Similarly, the reaction from players’-rights advocates was more muted than you might expect postvictory.“This is progress, but it’s just one step,” Ramogi Huma, of the College Athletes Players Association, said in a text message. “This ruling still treats athletes as second-class citizens. No other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic price-fixing, especially one imposed by a repeat antitrust violator that does not have an antitrust exemption.”How can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continue?According to Feldman, the answer includes a much-disputed antitrust principle known as the rule of reason. In some cases — including this one — the rule calls for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefits of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition as much.Wilken determined that amateurism was crucial to college sports’ commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sports, even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust law.“The court does credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sports and professional sports,” she said.Courts have given sports leagues a wide berth when it comes to antitrust, Feldman said: “The argument is that sports are unique.”After all, sports cannot really exist unless, say, 353 teams are allowed to agree to the same rules in men’s basketball, even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commerce.Wilken was also following precedent. Most of all, she was following a precedent set by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit — her circuit.In an earlier case, known as O’Bannon, the appellate court agreed with part of a Wilken finding at the district court level that the N.C.A.A. ban on compensating athletes for the commercial use of their names, images and likenesses in things like video games was an antitrust violation. But the appellate judges overturned her proposal that athletes be able to receive up to $5,000 annually in exchange. The Ninth Circuit’s reasoning was that such payments were not “tethered to education.”You can draw a direct line between that phrase, from 2015, and Wilken’s 2019 ruling in this case. That is how she Solomonically decided that the N.C.A.A. may restrict payments as long as they are noneducational.“Future plaintiffs, if they challenge N.C.A.A. rules, will look for a jurisdiction outside of the Ninth Circuit,” Feldman said. The Ninth Circuit, after all, has now made it very clear it will defer to the N.C.A.A.Another venue could rule in a more plaintiff-friendly direction. Kessler, the prominent sports lawyer, may now be able to push forward with a nearly identical case in Federal District Court in New Jersey.Either way, the future of college athletics is now out of the hands of Wilken, who for nearly a decade has loomed over it.Her decision last Friday may be a result of her understanding her power and its limits. Numerous observers expected a more plaintiff-friendly ruling based on the questions she asked during trial.Yet here we are, with little change.“This finding did not surprise me,” said Gerald Gurney, a former head of the reform-minded Drake Group.“Even though she may have wanted to completely agree with Kessler’s arguments,” Gurney added, “she did have some constraints.”"
"U.S. Women’s Team Takes a Stand as Gender Disparities Remain Widespread - The New York Times
They work just as hard as men for less pay.When they complain, they are told they need to generate as much money as men do if they want to get paid as much as men are paid. When they say that’s essentially impossible without more opportunities and promotion, they are told opportunity and promotion will happen once they start producing more money.This is the narrative at the heart of the gender discrimination lawsuit the United States women’s national soccer team filed on Friday against U.S. Soccer, but in nearly every sport, gender disparities in pay and working conditions are rampant.Coming just three months before the start of the Women’s World Cup, the litigation immediately became the central plotline for the event and brought to the fore an issue that has increasingly rankled the sports world.[Eight times women in sports fought for equality.]In golf last year, the world’s top-ranked woman earned as much as the 33rd-best man. The United States women’s hockey team expected to have a victory tour after winning gold at the Pyeongchang Olympics last year. It didn’t happen. The N.B.A. minimum salary of $1.35 million for a player with one year of experience is higher than the salary cap for an entire W.N.B.A. roster.“Unless the origin of the sport is anchored in women, like gymnastics or field hockey, I don’t think there’s a culture that starts with the premise: Women are going to be treated equally, or, we’re going to make up for the historical discrimination against women and make sure we’re going where we need to go,” said Donna Lopiano, a sports management consultant and former University of Texas athletics administrator, referring to both the national governing boards and to college sports.According to the national women’s team’s suit against U.S. Soccer, differing systems of compensation for the men’s and women’s teams have led to the women repeatedly earning less than their male counterparts, even though the women are defending champions and the men failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.Supporters of women’s sports praised the soccer team on Friday for taking a stand and trying to force the powers that be to address its complaints.“College sports has a great statute called Title IX,” said Nancy Hogshead-Makar, the chief executive of the advocacy group Champion Women.“What it takes, though,” she added, “is 18- to 22-year-olds speaking up, because the adults in the room have abdicated that role of ensuring gender equity.”Title IX — the 1972 landmark federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, including college sports — is nearly 50 years old. But advocates say that many universities fall short of the statute’s requirement that athletic opportunities must correlate with the overall student population. Both the college sports establishment and the federal government have evinced little interest in enforcing that requirement strictly.Advocates say that the N.C.A.A. and its members have not sufficiently prioritized increasing funding for women’s sports.“If sports are being dropped, the money isn’t going to women’s sports — it’s going to the arms race in football and men’s basketball,” Lopiano said. “The culture is football and men’s basketball first. Boys first. Women are still at the back of the bus.”Amy Wilson, the N.C.A.A. managing director of inclusion, said the N.C.A.A.’s member colleges, which create most policy, had no plans to further enforce Title IX to make up for the federal government’s failure to act.“The thinking is, we’re here to run an organization with rules for our sports,” Wilson said.A major challenge for female athletes has been to come up with a response to the argument that women deserve less money because their sports produce less money.Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, said that those who cling to a free-market argument fail to note the artificial advantages that men’s sports have long enjoyed. Men in the major team sports play in leagues that are monopolies, and have benefited from tens of millions of dollars in public subsidies that have helped finance and promote their endeavors.“While the revenue disparity is a major component of this, it’s partly a result of the lack of promotion women have received,” Zimbalist said. “There is a lot of historical and cultural baggage to all of this.”For all the gains that women have made in golf — the increase in playing opportunities in college and the integration of formerly all-male private clubs — the disparity in purses between the women of the L.P.G.A. Tour and the men of the PGA Tour continues to be striking.In 2018, the women’s leading money winner, Ariya Jutanugarn, won three events, including the United States Women’s Open, and posted 17 top-10 finishes in 28 starts. Her on-course earnings of $2,743,949 were surpassed by 33 players on the PGA Tour, led by Justin Thomas’s $8,694,821. Chesson Hadley, who ranked 33rd, did not record a victory and had seven top-10s in 30 starts on his way to $2,768,863. (The 33rd-ranked L.P.G.A. player, by comparison, earned $626,263.)In 2016, the L.P.G.A. and PGA Tour formed a partnership with the stated aim of creating joint marketing programs and events and coordinating schedules. The alliance apparently does not cover certain fees that fall under the T.P.C. Network, which is part of the PGA Tour.Brittany Lincicome, a two-time major champion, said that when she chooses to practice at T.P.C. Tampa Bay near her home she is required to pay cart fees. Card-carrying members of the PGA Tour incur no such fees.What bothers Lincicome is not the fee per se, “but the principle of it,” she said. “I’m a well-known L.P.G.A. player.”Two years ago, the future looked brighter for the United States women’s hockey team. Like the women’s soccer team, the hockey players were dominant in their sport internationally and far exceeded the achievements of the men’s national team.After threatening to boycott the world championship tournament in 2017 in Plymouth Township, Mich., amid contract negotiations with U.S.A. Hockey for a living wage and more playing opportunities, the women’s team reached a deal that paid each player about $71,000 annually. That was a vast increase over the less than $10,000 that some of them had been making. The deal also provided the female players with travel and insurance provisions that equaled what the men’s national team received.But the support for girls and women’s hockey that U.S.A. Hockey also promised then has been slow to develop. There are no women on U.S.A. Hockey’s marketing council. The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group, which was created in the 2017 deal, has only recently begun to have meaningful dialogue.After earning the gold medal at the 2018 Olympics with a dramatic shootout victory over Canada, its archrival, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, visiting talk shows and N.H.L. games. But its post-Olympic exhibition tour never materialized. And there are currently no women’s player jerseys or jerseys in women’s sizes available at U.S.A. Hockey’s online stores.“From a marketing standpoint, is it a huge missed opportunity?” Hilary Knight, the team’s star forward, said late last year. “Probably. We sort of disappeared from the summer.”In tennis, women have pulled closer to pay equality than in any other major sport, with equal pay on the sport’s biggest stages. Tennis players routinely dominate lists of the highest-paid female athletes. But a closer look at the scoreboard each year would still show, “Advantage: Men.”The four Grand Slam events and three other large tournaments — Indian Wells, Calif.; the Miami Open; and the Madrid Open — offer equal prize money to men and women, but women in the top 100 generally make only about 80 percent of the prize money their male counterparts make, because of lower pay at other tournaments.At the Australian Open, Serena Williams spoke of how she talks often about equality on the different boards she sits on outside the sport. “Bringing that into tennis, as well, is something that’s superimportant. The only way to do it is to talk about it and to be open about it, have these conversations that aren’t necessarily comfortable.”The biggest unresolved question in terms of how women are compensated for playing basketball right now is in the W.N.B.A., where the league and the players’ union are engaged in negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement.Erin Kane, an agent with Octagon who represents Kristi Toliver, Elena Delle Donne and other W.N.B.A. players, said players were largely satisfied with how U.S.A. Basketball treated them.“What the U.S.W.N.T. is doing is timely and inspiring,” Kane said of the soccer lawsuit. “When it comes to money, change is always a fight.”W.N.B.A. players, many of whom play overseas in their off-season to earn more money, are pushing for quality training resources that are consistent across the league and on a par with the N.B.A.Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, said the league’s compensation system is dependent on its revenues. “We want nothing more than for W.N.B.A. players to receive the recognition they deserve for being world-class athletes,” he said. “And as we work with the W.N.B.P.A. to improve the economics of the league, we also challenge the broader basketball and sports community to support the W.N.B.A. and its athletes.”Chiney Ogwumike, a member of the union’s executive committee, said that for too long W.N.B.A. players have been told to be grateful for what they have.“Our goal is to educate people to respect the fact that we too are the best of the best at what we do,” she said."
"The New A.A.F. Is Betting on Football, and on Betting - The New York Times
There are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”"
"IOC Wants Swift and Tough Punishment for Doping Offenders - The New York Times
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach on Wednesday demanded swift and tough sanctions for doping offenders -- both athletes and their support staff -- involved in a German-Austrian doping ring.At least 21 athletes from eight nations across five sports are suspected of blood-doping linked to a German doctor who was arrested as part of an Austria-Germany doping raid last month.Five athletes, including two Austrians, were initially arrested on Feb. 27 at the Nordic skiing world championships in the Austrian resort of Seefeld.The arrests were part of a joint operation with German police targeting a suspected international blood-doping ring believed to have been run out of Germany.""We hope that all this will be clarified and everything will come on the table and there those responsible and the entourage of these athletes, the doctors and the personnel, that they will be punished soon and hard,"" Bach said.""I hope that this is not dragging on, that their justice will really set an example. I hope there will be hard sanctions to have a deterrent effect on everybody,"" he added.A doctor in the German city of Erfurt was also arrested along with five other suspected accomplices.According to German prosecutors, the doping of the 21 athletes from five sports -- three winter and two summer -- occurred from 2011 onwards and blood transfusions took place in many countries across the world.Since the arrests other Austrian athletes have been implicated in blood doping. Cyclist Georg Preidler told police this month that he had attempted doping.Cross-country skier Johannes Duerr, whose interview with Germany's ARD television in which he admitted doping triggered the investigation and raids, was arrested on March 5.The IOC has had to deal with its own major doping scandal, stemming from the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and involving many Russian athletes, including medal winners.Some of those case are ongoing, making their way through the sports and civil courts, years after the athletes in question were identified.

"Players Hold Power Over the N.C.A.A., if They Feel the Hunger - The New York Times
MINNEAPOLIS — This Final Four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective, if inadvertent, instances of athlete activism in college sports.This was when the Connecticut star Shabazz Napier, speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game, said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat.“There are hungry nights that I go to bed and I’m starving,” he said.Within weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s board of directors for Division I voted to lift restrictions on how much teams could feed their players. No longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal (notoriously, serving peanuts did not count, while serving peanut butter did). Now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts.This common-sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually. But the stark comments by a high-profile player at the N.C.A.A.’s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the N.C.A.A.’s power over college athletes.It is fruitful to remember the efficacy of Napier’s comments, because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports’ much-maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within. The players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change.What would have happened if Zion Williamson had said, after his Nike shoe exploded, jeopardizing his career, that enough was enough, that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by Nike? And that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy, either?“The power is with labor and the players,” said Kain Colter, the former Northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago.This was most obviously displayed in 2015, when Missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired. He stepped down. That the boycott concerned the campus’s racial climate rather than the players’ compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened: The players — unpaid, un-unionized — flexed their muscles, and the system gave in.Vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant. From Jackie Robinson withstanding taunts, threats and worse to break Major League Baseball’s color line; to baseball players striking in the 1970s and ’80s to gain and keep full-fledged free agency; to the track standout Edwin Moses devising benefits for Olympic athletes, athletes have often been the ones bringing about change. Their leverage is unmatched: They are the ones the fans pay to see, and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit.And they are the only ones with a steady interest in, well, their own interest.Consider what else has happened since Napier’s comments.Colter’s unionization effort, which a National Labor Relations Board regional director endorsed weeks before Napier’s Final Four, was squashed by the overall board.The antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players.Last month, a second antitrust suit, which sought to explode the N.C.A.A.’s ban on compensation, concluded at the district-court level with a technical victory for players that looked as much like a victory for the establishment. A federal judge ruled that the N.C.A.A. could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education.“The courts are not a forum where you’re going to get relief,” said Don Yee, a sports lawyer and players-rights advocate.For Yee, who also happens to be Tom Brady’s agent, the solution is “private entrepreneurialism.” He is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the N.F.L. (which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school). It would be developmental, like college football, but unlike college football, average pay would be $50,000.A planned summer basketball league, the Historical Basketball League, would pay scholarships for its college-level players while enabling them to sell their names, images and likenesses to sponsors. The N.B.A.’s development league plans to offer higher salaries. The probable dissolution of the one-and-done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the N.B.A. instead of having to spend at least a year in college.A few states, notably North Carolina and California, have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if, say, a video game uses their names and likenesses.All these efforts are well intentioned. But if past is prologue, the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion.Nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition.At a news conference in Minneapolis last week, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports’ governance.“I’m a lifelong academic,” he said. “I grew up with that tradition, and I never worked at a school that didn’t have students on their board, and they were full voting board members. They voted on my contract, and I think that’s just perfectly appropriate.”There are athletes serving on several important councils, but there is not one on the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors. No athletes vote on Emmert’s contract, which was extended late last year through 2023.Tim Nevius, a onetime N.C.A.A. investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system, believes the answer lies with player activism. Last month, he announced a new organization, the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the N.C.A.A. with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players.He acknowledged in an interview the challenges, including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes, as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power. But he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change.“There are powers here that the athletes have,” he said, “and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands.”Ros Gold-Unwude, a Turner Sports analyst and former Stanford basketball player, said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order.“That’s the way our culture is, where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms,” she said.“If you’re really struggling or hungry,” she added, “that experience will come out.”Apathy will come out as well, though. Beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it, a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets.Napier, who is now a reserve on the Nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article, said more during his “hungry nights” speech heard ’round the world, even though it received less publicity.He noted that there were other wrongs. Players’ jerseys were sold to fans, and the players did not receive a cut. More basically, he said, the players were not paid.It was, he suggested, wrong. Probably.“Something can change, something should change,” Napier said five years ago. “But if it doesn’t, at the end of the day, we’ve been doing this for so long.”"
"Zion Williamson Will Be Fine, but His Teammates Might Not Be - The New York Times
When Zion Williamson of Duke went down with a severed shoe and a sprained knee 30 seconds into Wednesday night’s showdown with North Carolina, it was bad news for plenty involved. Williamson now has to deal with an injury. Duke had to play its archrival without its best player and duly lost, 88-72. Nike faced questions about its product’s apparent failure.But ESPN, broadcasting the contest as part of its multibillion-dollar deal with the Atlantic Coast Conference, did just fine. The game’s biggest star was injured for nearly 99 percent of the game, yet on Thursday, the network reported that the rivalry had produced its highest-ever ratings for a weeknight college basketball game.The episode crystallized the economic limitations that N.C.A.A. amateurism and N.B.A. rules impose on Williamson, a preternatural talent, and the unique ways that they limit the income of a unique player.If the N.B.A. did not bar high schoolers from heading straight to the league — a rule that may disappear in a few years — then Williamson could already have been playing for, say, the Atlanta Hawks and making several million dollars on his rookie contract. If N.C.A.A. rules did not prevent players from signing endorsements, Williamson could already have been receiving millions from Nike.However, barring an outright catastrophe, Williamson, the likely top draft pick, will be getting paid, soon and well, and at a time when his economic productivity is even higher than it is today. His specialness, though, obscures what some suggest is the greatest injustice of college sports’ policy of amateurism.In contrast to Williamson and a few other superstars, most players in college basketball are denied the right to cash in during what is very likely their moment of peak economic value.“The top guys are worth a lot — on the order of millions a year,” said Daniel Rascher, a sports economist who has studied the economic value of college athletes. “But the seven, eight, nine guys,” he added, referring to the players further down the depth chart, “are going to be several hundred thousand a year in terms of the incremental revenue they bring to the school.”Take Duke’s Jordan Goldwire. He was a midrated recruit out of high school, and his options besides Duke included midmajor programs such as Eastern Kentucky, Coastal Carolina and Nevada-Las Vegas. He is probably not bound for N.B.A. riches. This season, he has not played at all in three A.C.C. games and has averaged fewer than seven minutes in those he has played in. He played eight minutes against the Tar Heels on Wednesday. But that actually made him an essential contributor to a two-hour broadcast worth a lot of money to Duke, the A.C.C. and ESPN.“If you look at the N.B.A., the guys who don’t play very much still get paid a lot,” Rascher said.Or forget about Duke and think of the players at whichever team makes the N.C.A.A. tournament out of the Big South or the Patriot League. Part of that billion-dollar event’s charm comes from the quirky matchups — and the potential for exciting upsets — when such teams face juggernauts like Duke and Kansas in the early rounds. Players on those teams, too, are producing a real financial return for the N.C.A.A., for its member colleges and for CBS and Turner Sports, even though their abilities will never be remotely so lucrative again. Yet they are prohibited from taking more than a relatively small, prescribed share of that value.Moreover, all of these players, too, are risking futures in professional basketball — more of them than you might think. While fewer than 5 percent of Division I men’s basketball players are drafted into the N.B.A., the N.C.A.A. said last year, around half go on to play pro basketball in some form, such as in foreign leagues. From teams in the five top conferences, the N.C.A.A. added, more than three-quarters of players go on to be paid to play.The college sports establishment’s common rebuttal to these lines of thinking is that not paying the players beyond scholarships and related costs is actually crucial to the popularity of their sports.Last year, in a federal lawsuit challenging the N.C.A.A.’s restrictions on compensation from an antitrust perspective, Mike Aresco, a former sports television executive who is now commissioner of the American Athletic Conference, testified that college players’ amateur status was a feature of their sports’ appeal, not a bug.“It resonated with fans because it wasn’t professionalized at all,” he said, according to a court transcript, while serving as a witness for several conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. “And it was presented and framed as college students, as college sports.”Among other things, this distinction differentiated college basketball and college football from minor league sports, Aresco said. “And that was very important,” he added, “because minor leagues had never been popular.”He said: “People view college sports separately. And we always maintained that separation.”Rascher was a witness for the plaintiffs in that case, in which a decision is expected any day. His reply to arguments like Aresco’s was to point to the experiment of sorts that took place a few years ago, when the N.C.A.A. permitted colleges to offer athletes funds that included the so-called full cost of attendance. After players began to be “paid” slightly more than they had previously been, college sports’ popularity was not measurably affected.Williamson’s injury in the marquee game of the regular season, particularly so early in the contest, appeared to be a devastating blow to Duke, which entered as a 9-point favorite yet never led once. Being magnanimous, Roy Williams, North Carolina’s colorful coach, acknowledged as much afterward.“Be honest,” he said. “When the big fella goes out of the game, it changes a lot of stuff for them.”Judging from the final score, Williams was right. But be honest: If you looked only at the bottom line, you would not even know that the big fella was gone."
"FanDuel to Pay Out Some AAF Football Bets Despite League Stoppage - The New York Times
NEW YORK — The Alliance of American Football league is suspending operations before it can crown its first champions, but that is not stopping FanDuel's sportsbook from declaring a winner. FanDuel Group, a unit of Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair PLC, on Wednesday said the Orlando Apollos should have been the AAF champs and that it would pay out all straight futures wagers as winners.""For the fans that bet on the AAF, the least they should expect is for a competition to conclude as it should,"" FanDuel said in a statement. ""We believe this is the very definition of a bad beat for sports fans everywhere.""The payouts apply to bets in New Jersey since FanDuel did not take any bets on the AAF in West Virginia or Pennsylvania, where it also operates sportsbooks.This week, AAF owner Tom Dundon suspended operations after only eight weeks of game play following a number of operational and financial setbacks, according to media reports.As the new legal U.S. sports betting market grows state by state, some operators have chosen to refund or pay out wagers where they think betters have gotten an especially bad break.Such moves can serve to win over betters to legal, regulated bookmakers instead of the many pervasive illegal offshore websites.In February, PointsBet refunded New Jerseyans' wagers after Duke University star player Zion Williamson's sneaker split open.

"Admissions Scandal Stokes Hard Questions on Recruited Athletes - The New York Times
A dozen years ago, the University of Washington barred athletic coaches from having contact with anyone in the admissions department.With a move that now seems prescient, two new administrators supervising athletics sought to allay any concerns that coaches could put undue pressure on admissions personnel. The change also brought more oversight to athletics, in this case through a committee of senior faculty members, deans and other university representatives.The previous arrangement, said Philip Ballinger, an associate vice provost now overseeing admissions, “didn’t have sufficient transparency; it didn’t have enough eyes on it.”The leeway coaches get in recruiting has long been a point of discussion in higher education circles. But after federal investigators last week revealed a broad admissions cheating scandal, a number of colleges began asking hard questions about how they evaluate athletic applicants and oversee the chosen few whom coaches recommend for admission.In what prosecutors described as the biggest case of admissions fraud they had investigated, 50 people were accused in a scheme that involved paying bribes to coaches and to people who monitor admissions tests in order to fraudulently get the children of wealthy patrons into some of the nation’s most elite colleges.Some students were accepted as recruited athletes even though they did not play the sports described in their applications. They gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admissions spots to athletes who might not get in otherwise.This process has been followed for decades in the pursuit of competitive teams, which burnish a university’s reputation, inspire alumni loyalty and often help with fund-raising.Now, the fraud case has sent a thunderbolt through the higher education community.“Every college president in America called his athletic director the morning after that admissions fraud story broke and asked: How do we make sure this doesn’t happen at our school?” said Bill Martin, the athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. “And certain athletic directors were smart enough to call their presidents first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athlete.”Indeed, at Yale University, where F.B.I. investigators say the longtime women’s soccer coach accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer, the university president, Peter Salovey, announced late last week that new oversight policies had already been put in place. The Yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit’s credentials before admission, and recruited athletes who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive “close scrutiny,” a university statement said.A broad overhaul of athletic admissions systems in Division I, the highest level of N.C.A.A. competition and the level the colleges in the scheme compete in, has been overdue, according to several athletic administrators interviewed in recent days.Battles over blue-chip recruits in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized. In those upper echelon sports, if there is money changing hands, it is from coaches to recruits, not the other way around.But in the lower-profile sports like crew, volleyball, tennis and soccer — often called the Olympic sports — there has been more room for bribes and exploitation. And the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect as a “recruited walk-on.” In nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credentials cited in last week’s indictments, from Stanford to Texas to Yale, the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walk-on.Such applicants are not even assured a spot on the team. But they are often on a list of five to 20 athletes — it varies from sport to sport — that a coach is permitted to submit to the admissions department.The two daughters of the actress Lori Loughlin, who was charged in connection with the fraud case last week, were passed off as crew recruits despite never having competed in the sport, according to federal prosecutors.That choice of sport may not have been an accident. In a sport like women’s crew, where rosters can balloon to 125 athletes, many teams have scores of recruited walk-ons. (Such large rosters can help a college comply with federal equality laws, balancing out the number of male athletes in football.)“When the rosters are that big, like they are in women’s crew, I could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person as a recruited walk-on,” said Martin, who added that Michigan annually audited team rosters.The recruitment of athletes in such sports may be an even bigger factor in the admissions process at colleges in the N.C.A.A.’s lowest tier, Division III, where athletic scholarships are forbidden.Division III is also the largest tier, with nearly 450 institutions, including many of the country’s most selective small liberal arts colleges, where acceptance rates can be as low as 15 percent. These colleges might field as many as 30 teams from enrollments as small as 2,000, with varsity athletes, many of them afforded an advantage in admissions, making up 30 percent to 45 percent of the student body.These small colleges, like the largest ones, also give preferential treatment to applicants who excel in music, the arts and a host of other skills. There are also allowances for students from the least-populated states.“Admissions is filling all the different buckets,” said Wendy Smith, the athletic director at Haverford College, a highly rated institution near Philadelphia. “And our athletes are right in there. We are not in any way gaming the system. They are absolutely on par academically.”The cost of fielding a successful sports team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads to other troubling conflicts of interest.In the Ivy League, for example, most coaches are responsible for fund-raising that bridges the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully. That can lead to uncomfortable decisions about composing a team, especially since athletes’ families often become the leading donors.“You have a family who will give you $25,000, but then you are not going to play their daughter?” said Paul Wardlaw, who was the women’s tennis coach at Brown University for 14 years.“The whole scandal is interesting, and it’s human nature to take the easy route,” he said, “but there are some systematic issues that are contributing to this.”At many elite institutions, the notion that recruited athletes have been granted an unfair advantage is palpable.Cameron Green, a tight end on the football team at Northwestern University, which accepts about 13 percent of applicants, conceded that several of his high school classmates who did not play sports had applied to Northwestern and been rejected.“It’s easier for athletes to get in, so I know that’s hard for regular students,” said Green, a senior who does not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility. “A lot of kids I knew were confused when I got in and they didn’t, but you know, at the end of the day, the school looks at your demographics on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet you.”The high percentage of recruited athletes at some colleges, particularly smaller ones, has other consequences, some of them at odds with institutional ambitions for a diverse student body.Because success in youth sports today often comes more easily to affluent families who spend copiously on private instruction, the rosters of college teams have become predominantly white — nearly 80 percent at some small schools.In the end, some in the higher education community believe that last week’s admissions fraud scandal, while an embarrassing lesson in what policy changes need to be made, is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admissions procedures at American colleges.“There is now this notion that admissions is a competitive cesspool, and it’s not,” said Michael Reilly, the executive director of the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers. “In fact,” Reilly added, “most campuses nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goals. But then we have this segment that’s highly competitive and has created a completely different dynamic. If I were on those campuses, I’d be sitting down and saying, ‘Let’s rethink how we’re doing this.’”"
"Mike Trout Received a Huge Payday. But Others Still Dwarf Him - The New York Times
The best player in baseball is closing in on the richest contract in the history of North American sports. Mike Trout, the center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels, is finalizing a contract extension that will be worth about $430 million and keep him with the team through 2030, according to two people who were briefed on the deal but were not authorized to comment publicly.However the deal is calculated — either an additional $360 million over 10 years or the Angels’ total commitment of about $430 million for the next 12 years — Trout has eclipsed the previous record for guaranteed money: the 13-year, $330 million deal Bryce Harper signed this month with the Philadelphia Phillies.The extension, which was first reported by ESPN, would establish Trout as the highest-paid baseball player on an annual basis, topping the $34.4 million Zack Greinke is earning from the Arizona Diamondbacks on a six-year, $206.5 million contract signed in December 2015.[From 2017: Mike Trout, Baseball’s Best Without the Brand]While it is an enormous amount of money, even this record-breaking contract doesn’t necessarily bring Trout into the highest tier of overall income for professional athletes.While comparing contracts across sports and continents is an inherently difficult undertaking because of varied contractual structures, tax burdens, bonuses and ancillary benefits, it is clear that even with the monster deal Trout would fall well short of becoming the world’s highest paid athlete annually.The soccer superstar Lionel Messi, for example, is expected to earn more than 106 million euros (about $120 million) per year from Barcelona through 2021, an amount that could rise to 120 million euros if certain incentives are met. The boxer Canelo Álvarez will earn at least $73 million annually from a five-year deal with the streaming service DAZN.Trout, 27, also won’t have the highest annual salary in North American team sports. In the N.B.A., Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors is making $37.5 million this season, and the Houston Rockets’ James Harden will earn $42.3 million annually once his four-year, $169.3 million contract extension kicks in.The highest-paid N.F.L. player, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, earns a bit less than Trout is expected to: an average of $33.5 million from a four-year, $134 million contract (though only $98.7 million of that is guaranteed). Unlike Major League Baseball, the N.F.L. and N.B.A. have salary caps.Compared with superstars in other sports, Trout has a limited ability to earn money outside the game. Baseball players typically aren’t as well-known nationally or internationally as their counterparts in other major sports, and Trout’s lack of marketability has been lamented by M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred.Trout does have a number of endorsement deals with companies including Rawlings and Nike, and in 2014 he became of the first baseball player since Ken Griffey Jr. to get a Nike signature cleat. But baseball players’ ability to move merchandise pales in comparison to that of a basketball player or a soccer player, and endorsement contracts reflect that.Trout earns an estimated $2.5 million from endorsements annually, according to Forbes. Kevin Durant’s endorsement deal with Nike alone is worth up to $300 million over 10 years, while Harden will earn $200 million over 13 years from Adidas. LeBron James of the N.B.A. and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese soccer star for Juventus, have lifetime deals with Nike that are rumored to be worth $1 billion each.While a handful of athletes earn more from their contracts annually than Trout, those individuals almost assuredly will not be doing so in 2030, the final year of Trout’s deal. N.B.A. contracts last a maximum of five years, and with a few exceptions, soccer contracts are rarely longer than that, either. Boxers typically earn their money fight to fight, while golf and tennis players simply claim a share of tournament prize money.But in 2030, no matter how Trout’s baseball career progresses, he will earn at least $36 million — a priceless long-term assurance.He has earned the payout by putting together seven astounding seasons to begin his career; the most similar players, production-wise, at his age, according to Baseball Reference, have been the Hall of Famers Frank Robinson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mickey Mantle. Trout has won two American League Most Valuable Player Awards and been the runner-up four times. His career batting average is .307 and he is the majors’ active leader in on-base plus slugging percentage, at .990.But, adding to Trout’s lack of recognition and earning power, postseason success has eluded him. He has reached the playoffs just once, in 2014, when the Angels were swept by the Kansas City Royals in a division series. The possibility of Trout departing for a new team loomed after the 2020 season, when his six-year, $144.5 million contract was set to expire; Harper, for one, had said he would love for Trout to join him in Philadelphia.Trout still lives in his hometown, Millville, N.J., in the off-season, and is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan. But the Angels had tried to impress upon Trout the benefits of keeping his work and home lives separate, and to sell him on the idea of being a one-team icon with a franchise with which he has thrived. And with a promise of an enormous paycheck — at least for on-field performance — the Angels put together a winning pitch."
"WWE's Next Battle Royale: Investor Fans vs. Shorts - The New York Times
(Reuters) - A brawl between World Wrestling Entertainment Inc's bears and bulls could reach a peak this year as the company renegotiates overseas contracts. While a large contingent of short sellers have been betting that the stock will fall, WWE's most ardent Wall Street fans say it will continue to rise even after outperforming the stock market last year and for much of 2019.Shares in WWE soared 144 percent in 2018 as U.S. TV license deals blew past analyst expectations with a 3.6-times hike in average annual value from its previous agreements. The stock has risen another 12.6 percent so far this year as investors are betting on license renewals being negotiated in countries including India and the United Kingdom, which WWE expects to announce by mid-year. Ten out of 13 analysts have buy ratings on the stock while three recommend holding the stock which last traded at $84.87. The mean share price target is $102.70 with the highest target at $157 and the lowest at $85, according to Refinitiv.While the stock has already risen a lot on expectations for new business, Gabelli Funds analyst Alexandra Cowie says it still has room to gain further. ""I wouldn't be selling before the contract news. Going in and coming out of announcements, it gets a double bump,"" said Cowie, whose firm owns more than 174,000 WWE shares. WWE is in an unusual entertainment category. Unlike traditional sports, its fights are scripted, but analysts measure its popularity against sports because it still involves athleticism and suspense.The creator of Smackdown and Raw TV shows boasted a U.S. cable television viewership second only to the National Football League in 2018, according to Nielsen data. And in India, WWE viewership was second only to cricket, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council.Guggenheim Securities analyst Curry Baker expects a UK renewal similar to WWE's current contract there. But he anticipates a fivefold boost to its average annual revenue in India to $124 million. ""The market is underappreciating the India opportunity,"" said Baker who has a $105 price target and a buy rating on WWE.MKM analyst Eric Handler, who raised his price target for the stock to $110 from $95 on Tuesday, says a possible U.S. deal for a third weekly hour of Smackdown could add $50 million to annual revenue. The company declined to comment on the prospect of an additional hour. WWE shares have fallen roughly 9 percent since last Thursday. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Vincent McMahon sold 3.2 million of his shares, or four percent of WWE's shares outstanding, to fund a separate entity. The stock last traded down 0.9 percent on Thursday in active trade though analysts said the news did not change their outlook It has also come under pressure as the broader market has been losing ground on worries about global economic growth. But analysts say WWE contracts - which are for around three to five years - provide some insulation against economic fluctuations. In the United States, live sports have been a key draw for cable TV subscribers, at a time when many consumers are cutting the chord to avoid high monthly fees. ""It feels like one of the lower-risk higher-return names in the media space,"" said Baker.Still, about 17 percent of WWE's float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners which estimates short seller mark-to-market losses of $359 million since the start of 2018. The bets against the stock can be partly attributed to hedging by investors in its convertible bonds due in 2023, according to BTIG analyst Brandon Ross. “That’s contributed to it,” he said.Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker is Wall Street's biggest fan, with a price target of $157. Wall Street expects 2020 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $460.59 million on $1.33 billion revenue, according to Refinitiv data. Ryvicker expects EBITDA of $510 million on revenue of $1.423 billion. With this in mind, Ryvicker says WWE looks cheap compared with other sports peers, including Knicks basketball team owner Madison Square Garden Co and a Liberty Media Corp subsidiary which owns Formula One rights and Liberty's subsidiary that owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team.WWE's enterprise value is roughly 14.8 times her 2020 EBITDA estimates compared with multiples of 32 for Madison Square Garden, 33.2 for Liberty's Atlanta Braves subsidiary and 12.6 for the Formula One subsidiary, the analyst wrote. WWE ""has no reason not to trade right in-line with its closest peers,"" Ryvicker said.

"Abuse Allegations Leave Afghanistan Women's Soccer Team in Tatters - The New York Times
KABUL — Allegations of sexual abuse of members of Afghanistan's national women's soccer team by sport officials have resulted in missed paychecks after sponsors pulled out, taunts and entreaties from parents to their daughters to quit playing. FIFA, global soccer's governing body, suspended the head of the Afghan Football Federation and several other officials in December. The Afghan federation has called the allegations against its president, Keramuddin Keram, ""groundless"".Afghan President Ashraf Ghani ordered an investigation after Britain's Guardian newspaper reported in November that senior figures linked to the women's team alleged that some players had been molested by federation officials.The treatment of the female players, even those who have not alleged sexual abuse, illustrate the Afghan culture's complicated approach to handling matters involving both women's sexuality and participation in sports.The national women's team was only formed in 2010. Some conservative-minded Afghans oppose women playing sports. Since the investigation was launched, so many players have stopped training that friendly matches scheduled for outside Afghanistan have been canceled, said the federation's Arzu Rahimi, who is responsible for women's soccer.PUBLIC SHAME, FAMILY PRESSUREAt least seven players have made allegations, although they have not been identified publicly. Five of the players who have made allegations did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.Parents, alarmed by public treatment of female players since the allegations, have urged their daughters to give up soccer.""My mother told me not to go to federation, university or even outside the house anymore,"" said Samea Hamasi, 25, a member of the team for seven years.Players who were in Uzbekistan for a series of matches in November faced taunts from Afghans living there.Players sobbed in the dressing room in Tashkent's stadium and had to be coaxed to take the field, many with tears in their eyes.""After what people have put us through, I say to myself that I wish I were not an Afghan at all,"" Samea said.Fereshta Shaikh Miri, 23, has played for the team for five years.""Before I was proud to be a member of the team, but now it is a stigma to be part of the team and I feel ashamed to mention that I am part of the national soccer team,"" she said.The men's soccer team, receiving government support, has begun spring training, but training has been canceled for the women.Dubai-based Alokozay Group, a company with a ubiquitous presence in Kabul selling soft drinks, tissues and tea, pulled its $850,000 annual contribution to the federation in February, following Danish sports brand Hummel, which canceled its sponsorship in late November.Afghanistan's soccer federation is now solely funded by FIFA, the Asian Football Confederation and the government.""All the achievements of the national soccer team would be impossible without (Alokozay's) support,"" said Yusuf Kargar, supervisor of Afghanistan's soccer federation. ""After all the rumors about the abuses of female players, they are looked at negatively by the public."" Alokozay canceled its sponsorship because of an administrative vacuum resulting from the allegations, the company said in a February statement. In a statement in November, Hummel cut ties with the Afghan Football Federation citing its ""unacceptable behavior"".The investigation of the players' allegations is at an early stage, said Mohammad Sadeq Farahi, head of the crime investigation department for the Office of the Attorney General.It now wants to send investigators to France, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany and Greece to interview players living abroad, and is seeking visas, he said.Separately, FIFA is conducting its own investigation. The organization said in March Keram would remain suspended for three months. (Reporting by Orooj Hakimy; Writing by Rod Nickel; Editing by Rob Birsel)"
"Bob Costas Accuses NBC of Retaliating for His Remarks on Concussions in N.F.L. - The New York Times
Bob Costas, the longtime sportscaster and prime-time host on NBC, alleged in an interview that aired on Sunday that the network’s executives abruptly removed him from covering last year’s Super Bowl after he criticized the violence in football and how the “game destroys people’s brains.”His nearly 40-year relationship with NBC Sports, first as its boyish announcer and later as elder statesman, came crashing down over five days in November 2017. At a symposium that month with fellow journalists, Mr. Costas remarked on what he saw as the life-altering dangers of the sport, devastating consequences for its players and existential questions confronting the National Football League.“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains — not everyone’s, but a substantial number,” Mr. Costas told the crowd at the University of Maryland. “It’s not a small number, it’s a considerable number. It destroys their brains.”His highly critical remarks, while in line with his past public comments about the link between playing football and head trauma, including an hourlong NBC special about it in 2013, quickly grabbed headlines and cast an uncomfortable spotlight on NBC Sports just months before it would broadcast the N.F.L.’s biggest and most lucrative event, the Super Bowl.At the end of that week in November, Mr. Costas appeared on the CNN program “Smerconish” in what he later described as an effort to soften the reaction to his remarks. He said that network executives had been well aware of his thoughts about football and that “NBC Sports deserves credit” for supporting him as he expressed his views.Still, network executives were seething, according to Mr. Costas, setting in motion his removal from the network’s Super Bowl plan and his eventual departure from NBC. Mr. Costas spoke about the episode with ESPN last year for a story that aired Sunday on “Outside the Lines.”Within an hour of his appearance on CNN, he said, he received a text message from Sam Flood, an executive producer at NBC. “I think the words were, ‘You’ve crossed the line,’” Mr. Costas told ESPN, adding that he no longer had the text message.Mr. Costas told ESPN that he believed his remarks had cut too close to the delicate, multibillion-dollar business relationship between the N.F.L. and the networks that carry the games.“Look, the N.F.L. isn’t just the most important sports property, it’s the single most important property in all of American television,” Mr. Costas said. “And it isn’t even close.”An NBC Sports spokesman confirmed that Mr. Costas had been told that he had “crossed the line” but said it was not because he had discussed the topic of brain injuries and football. Instead, the spokesman said, it was because Mr. Costas had agreed after the University of Maryland symposium that he would no longer discuss the topic in interviews without prior approval from NBC Sports.He had not sought approval for the CNN interview, the spokesman, Greg Hughes, said on Monday.Shortly after the CNN appearance, Mr. Costas said, he was told he would not be part of NBC’s coverage of Super Bowl LII in February 2018. It was a sudden breakup between NBC and Mr. Costas, its longtime host of the Olympics and of “Football Night in America,” the network’s highly rated Sunday N.F.L. pregame show. Last year, he described the separation in public as “mutually agreeable.”The parting was the culmination of Mr. Costas’s wavering commitment over many years to covering the N.F.L. He stepped away from NBC’s coverage in the 1990s, later saying the decision was because he “had ambivalent feelings about football.” Yet he was a host of HBO’s “Inside the N.F.L.” in the 2000s and then rejoined NBC’s coverage of the sport in the 2006-7 season, when the network started a $600 million-a-year deal with the league for Sunday night games. He continued hosting that program, “Sunday Night Football,” for the next decade, as awareness about the long-term effects of head injuries continued to rise.During that time, Mr. Costas used the top-rated show’s platform to provide commentary on everything from guns to politics. In a halftime commentary in 2012, Mr. Costas called for “enlightened legislation and controls” on guns a day after a Kansas City Chiefs player shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself.The network never received criticism or complaints from the N.F.L. about Mr. Costas’s coverage or commentary, including his remarks at the 2017 symposium, Mr. Hughes said.By the time Mr. Costas appeared at that event, he had already taken a back seat in NBC’s coverage. He hosted the first “Football Night in America” of the 2017-18 football season but then handed off the remaining shows to Mike Tirico, who had moved over from ESPN to become NBC’s face of major sports events. When NBC eventually announced that Mr. Costas would not participate in the Super Bowl broadcast, he said that it would not have been fair to those who had been there the entire season.“It wouldn’t be right for me to parachute in and do the Super Bowl,” he told The Associated Press weeks before the event. NBC and Mr. Costas officially parted ways last fall, when they agreed to end his contract early."
"Finally, the N.B.A. Comes to Charlotte - The New York Times
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — As the N.B.A. prepares for All-Star Game festivities this weekend in Charlotte, N.C., the backdrop to the celebration is unequivocally political, as nearly everything in the divided state seems to be these days.The event was supposed to have been in Charlotte in 2017. But in March 2016, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law, known as House Bill 2 or HB2, that invalidated local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the genders listed on their birth certificates.Supporters called the law a necessary public safety measure, but opponents condemned it as intolerant, and a backlash emerged, chasing away businesses, conventions and concerts and testing sports leagues that are normally averse to political debates.The N.B.A. moved the All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans. The N.C.A.A. and the Atlantic Coast Conference removed championship games and tournaments from the state, a stunning blow given the hold college basketball has over North Carolina.Political scientists say the law contributed when the governor at the time, Pat McCrory, a Republican, lost his subsequent re-election bid by 10,000 votes.“There was a sense that the election was a referendum on HB2, and a verdict was rendered,” said Pope McCorkle, a professor of public policy at Duke University and a former Democratic political consultant.A year later, with the N.C.A.A. saying the state had 48 hours to change the law or lose the chance to host any N.C.A.A. championship games through 2022, House Bill 2 was partially repealed. That was enough for the N.B.A., and it has allowed Charlotte to present itself as a welcoming place, however much some activists believe the repeal did not go far enough.For sports organizations, the partial repeal, known as HB142, allowed them to return to the state, a growing and important market. Within weeks, the N.C.A.A. and the A.C.C. returned championship games to North Carolina, and the N.B.A. quickly awarded Charlotte the 2019 All-Star Game. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said that he understood concerns that the repeal did not go far enough but that he believed it eliminated “the most egregious aspects of the prior law.”That the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A. found themselves in the middle of a pitched political brawl in the Tar Heel state was fitting. Sports have long been intertwined with politics in North Carolina.Kenan Memorial Stadium, where the University of North Carolina’s football teams have played for 90 years, was originally named for William R. Kenan, a 19th century merchant who led the massacre of dozens of black residents of Wilmington. In 2018, the university decided to name the stadium instead for his son, William R. Kenan. Jr., a former university trustee and businessman.In the 1960s, Dean Smith, the longtime coach of North Carolina’s basketball team, was a force for integration and civil rights in the state. More recently, former North Carolina athletes helped end plans to return a Confederate monument to campus.Activists and Democratic politicians praise the role sports organizations played in overturning House Bill 2, but only to a point. The partial repeal overturned the portions of the law dealing with restrooms but largely left the other provisions intact. They see it as a less discriminatory law that is far from perfect.“Philosophically, it wasn’t the correct fix, but it achieved a good objective,” said Representative Deb Butler, a Democrat and one of North Carolina’s few openly gay lawmakers. She voted against the partial repeal.Kathy Behrens, the N.B.A.’s president of social responsibility, said the league has equality principles that each arena, vendor, hotel or other business the N.B.A. works with for the All-Star Game is required to adhere to.Among other requirements, she said, each partner must “ensure that any restroom it provides for its personnel or the general public will be open for use by all individuals consistent with their gender identities.”Still, some states, including New York and California, maintain bans against any official state travel to North Carolina. Netflix recently opted to film “OBX,” which is set in North Carolina’s Outer Banks, in South Carolina because of the bill. A lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging portions of the bill is pending.“This debate should never have been about sports,” said Chris Brook, the legal director of the A.C.L.U. of North Carolina. “Basketball is something of a religion here in North Carolina, but HB2 and HB142 at bottom are about people’s lives and their rights to live a public life.”North Carolina’s political battles continue. The Supreme Court will rule this year on partisan gerrymandering in the state, and one of the North Carolina’s seats in the House of Representatives remains vacant because of credible voter fraud allegations. A bloody state budget battle looms.For the moment, though, sports is not on the docket."
"Diamondbacks' Jones Requested Fan Be Removed - The New York Times
The Arizona Diamondbacks' Adam Jones had a fan removed from San Diego's Petco Park during Wednesday night's game for spewing profane language, the outfielder told AZCentral.com.Jones, who is from San Diego, said the fan was ""cussing me out"" while tracking down a fly ball in right field during the fifth inning of Arizona's 4-1 loss to the Padres.""These fans in sports, man, they're starting to get a little more brazen,"" Jones told AZCentral. ""My biggest thing is, keep the banter polite - we suck, I struck out, the team's not good. Keep it light, keep it smart. ... But the second you start cussing me out like I'm a little kid, that's a no-no.""On the street, they'd never do that. In the ballpark when you've paid your admission, there's no need for all that stuff. The second I hear somebody cussing us out, you're gone,"" Jones said. ""I made a nice play, and just hearing the B-word, F-word, that's not baseball talk. So ... he gone.""Jones made national headlines in 2017 when, as a member of Baltimore Orioles, he claimed to be on the receiving end of racial taunts and having a bag of peanuts thrown on him at Fenway Park during a game in early May.The incident resulted in an investigation and official apology from the Red Sox as well as condemnations from the Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor.--Field Level Media"

"U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination - The New York Times
Twenty-eight members of the world champion United States women’s soccer team significantly escalated their long-running fight with the country’s soccer federation over pay equity and working conditions, filing a gender discrimination lawsuit on Friday.The suit, in United States District Court in Los Angeles, comes only three months before the team will begin defense of its Women’s World Cup title at this summer’s tournament in France. In their filing and a statement released by the team, the 28 players described “institutionalized gender discrimination” that they say has existed for years.The discrimination, the athletes said, affects not only their paychecks but also where they play and how often, how they train, the medical treatment and coaching they receive, and even how they travel to matches.The players involved — stars like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd and their teammates — include some of the most accomplished and best-known female athletes in the world, members of a team that has been a leading force in women’s sports for more than a generation.The players’ continuing battle with U.S. Soccer, which is not only their employer, but also the federation that governs the sport in America, has thrust them to the forefront of a broader fight for equality in women’s sports. In recent years, players, teams and even athletes in other sports — American hockey gold medalists, Canadian soccer pros, W.N.B.A. players — have reached out to the United States players and their union for guidance in their efforts to win similar gains in pay and working conditions.“I think to be on this team is to understand these issues,” Rapinoe said in a telephone interview. “And I think we’ve always — dating back to forever — been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place.”Friday’s legal action is the latest flash point in a yearslong fight for pay equity and equal treatment by the national team, which has long chafed — first privately, but increasingly publicly — about the compensation, support and working conditions it receives while representing U.S. Soccer. The women’s players argue that they are required to play more games than the men’s team, that they win more of them, and yet still receive less pay from the federation.[Sign up for the Sports newsletter.] For decades, U.S. Soccer has been a world leader in its support for women’s soccer; its investment of time and resources has made the United States, which is a three-time world champion and a four-time Olympic gold medalist, the dominant power in the women’s game. But throughout that period, generations of women’s national team players have complained that the federation’s financial support and logistical infrastructure have lagged behind that of the more high-profile men’s team.Those grievances have never been far from the surface; an earlier generation of top women’s players angry about their pay boycotted a tournament in Australia in January 2000, only months after a World Cup victory had made them the toast of American sports. The dispute between the team and the federation burst into the open more recently as an increasingly emboldened and activist women’s team took on U.S. Soccer and FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, over everything from artificial turf fields to World Cup bonus payments to refereeing standards.The players’ prominence and willingness to leverage their profiles and enormous social media followings in support of their cause have paid dividends: FIFA doubled the prize money pool for this summer’s Women’s World Cup only after the United States team’s complaints drew attention to how far it lagged behind the pool for the much richer men’s event, and the team has not played a match on artificial turf, a surface many players disdain, since 2017. The United States women flew on a chartered flight — once an unthinkable luxury for the squad — between matches as recently as last week, and U.S. Soccer has eliminated other inequities on topics as disparate as meal money and hotel accommodations.The respect they have won has spread, too: Spain’s national team rose up to demand the ouster of its coach after the last World Cup, and several prominent members of Brazil’s squad quit their team to protest the ouster of a popular female coach in favor of a man. Players from Argentina and Colombia have gone public about mistreatment and meager pay, and Norway’s players demanded — and won — equal pay with their men’s counterparts. That, too, several United States players said, was part of their motivation to press ahead with their suit only months before they turn their focus to retaining their world championship.“We very much believe it is our responsibility,” Rapinoe said, “not only for our team and for future U.S. players, but for players around the world — and frankly women all around the world — to feel like they have an ally in standing up for themselves, and fighting for what they believe in, and fighting for what they deserve and for what they feel like they have earned.”U.S. Soccer did not respond to a request for comment.Direct comparisons between the compensation of the men’s and women’s teams can be complicated. Each team has its own collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer, and among the major differences is pay structure: The men receive higher game bonuses when they play for the United States, but are paid only when they make the team, while the women receive guaranteed salaries supplemented by smaller match bonuses.One of the biggest differences in compensation is the multimillion-dollar bonuses the teams receive for participating in the World Cup, but those bonuses — a pool of $400 million for 32 men’s teams versus $30 million for 24 women’s teams — are determined by FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, not U.S. Soccer.The bulk of the suit mirrors many of the issues raised in a wage discrimination complaint filed by five United States players with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016. Frustrated by a lack of progress on that complaint after nearly three years of inaction, the players received permission from the federal agency in February to sue instead. (One of the players on the original complaint, the former goalkeeper Hope Solo, filed her own gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer in August.)The suit offers a new forum but also new hurdles. The players, represented by Jeffrey Kessler, who has been involved in labor fights in nearly every major American sport, will have to prove not only that their team and the men’s squad do the same work, but also overcome questions about the differences in their pay structures and their negotiated collective bargaining agreements. And the C.B.A. has already left them without one bit of leverage: The players cannot strike to press their case at least until it expires at the end of 2021.But to experts in gender discrimination and Title IX cases, the argument they are making is familiar.“These are the same kinds of arguments and claims that we still see at every level of education for women and girls, from K through 12 to college,” said Neena Chaudhry, the general counsel of the National Women’s Law Center in Washington. “It’s unfortunately a sad continuation of the way that women and girls in sports are treated in the U.S.”"

"Conor McGregor’s Retirement and the U.F.C.’s Plan to Survive It - The New York Times
Conor McGregor has retired and un-retired before, so it is possible he will return to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.But if McGregor, who loves to talk as much as he loves to fight and loves to win, has indeed left the sport for good after months of career and legal troubles, U.F.C. will be without its most popular and recognizable fighter just as it is trying to expand its footprint in a crowded sports landscape.“In the short run, they’ll miss the attention that Conor gives them, no doubt,” said Marshall Zelaznik, who spent 10 years as a U.F.C. executive before leaving in 2016. “For the longevity of a promotion, you need these kinds of stars.”[Read: McGregor is under investigation in Ireland after an accusation of sexual assault.]U.F.C. has churned out other athletes with crossover appeal. Jon Jones, the first mixed martial artist with a Nike signature shoe, recently returned from a 15-month doping suspension. Ronda Rousey, who has become a professional wrestler, regularly drew huge pay-per-view audiences as recently as 2016.Now the sport is confronting a fallow period, with unfortunate timing. ESPN, the new U.F.C. broadcast partner, has taken over the sport’s pay-per-view distribution and will air the main events exclusively on its streaming network, ESPN+.“It’s at a crossroads,” David Carter, the director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California, said of U.F.C.The company’s alignment with ESPN ushers a once renegade sport deeper into the mainstream. On top of a reported five-year, $1.5 billion deal struck last May that wrested the complete media rights package from Fox, ESPN paid an undisclosed fee to extend that deal through 2025 and become the only purveyor of pay-per-view fights in the United States. They will be shown exclusively on ESPN+, which costs $4.99 monthly. Main cards will cost an extra $59.99.ESPN has not released any viewership data from ESPN+ beyond acknowledging in its quarterly earnings call in February that two million subscribers had signed up and that it attracted 568,000 new subscribers in January, when the initial deal with U.F.C. kicked in. It is unknown, for instance, whether people signed up for ESPN+ and then left — and if so, how many.Even before McGregor retired on Tuesday, Carter said he believed this was a critical time for U.F.C., which is owned by Endeavor, a sports, entertainment and fashion content marketing company.“Our metrics show that our fan base has significantly scaled,” said Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, “and that M.M.A. viewers are buying the fights as much for the slate of fights as they are any one individual fighter.”According to Nielsen data, through five live telecasts on ESPN’s main channels, U.F.C. is averaging 1,462,000 viewers, or more than twice as many as its fights averaged (707,000) on FS1 last year.Still, U.F.C. appears to have reached a critical juncture in the same manner as other leagues, like the N.B.A., that struggled with sustainable star power during transition seasons.The challenge for U.F.C., Carter said, is to develop the new fighters to supplant the old guard when, to some extent, fans will have to pay for an ESPN+ subscription to get to know them.And lately casual sports fans have been hearing about U.F.C. largely in connection with fight cancellations or suspensions. Or in McGregor’s case, a suspension for his role in a brawl after he lost a fight in Las Vegas and criminal charges after he was caught on video last spring outside Barclays Center throwing a metal dolly into the window of a bus carrying U.F.C. athletes and employees. He pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn court to one count of disorderly conduct.“That’s not limited to U.F.C. at all,” Carter said. “But at some point, I think at some point casual fans get fatigued by the circus element of it.”By selling the rights to ESPN, U.F.C. no longer has to worry about some of the uncontrollable elements that affect pay-per-view purchases — injuries, suspensions, retirements. The venture is somewhat risky for ESPN as it tries to determine whether a substantial audience will quickly adapt to a new network and subscribe to ESPN+, but the deal represents a long-term investment.ESPN did not make anyone available for comment, but a partnership with the network improves U.F.C.’s chances of becoming a topic of conversation on ESPN programs like SportsCenter and First Take.“I do think they need to do a better job of building stars, making people stand out,” Chuck Liddell, one of the early U.F.C. stars, said in a telephone interview. “There’s so many fights now. Back in the day, there used to be six U.F.C. events. Now there’s what, 40?”Under ESPN’s deal, there will be 42 nights of live events, including 12 on pay-per-view, which will increase the need for appealing fights. Zelaznik joined U.F.C. in 2006, in the middle of Liddell’s career. He said he could not recall feeling anxious about unearthing new talent, or there being a lull.“The biggest difference right now is that when I came on, U.F.C. was the only game in town — it was the entire cola category,” said Zelaznik, who oversaw U.F.C.’s pay-per-view and digital business and is now the chief executive officer at Glory Sports International. “Now U.F.C. is clearly the Coke and Pepsi, and then there’s a lot of RC Cola and Shasta. The uniqueness has sort of worn off. The novelty isn’t what it was. People are familiar with it, so how do you make people care?”That question is central to the growth of U.F.C., which wants to protect itself for the future while providing a return on ESPN’s investment. Michael Berman, executive vice president of programming and general counsel for In Demand, which until recently distributed U.F.C. fights to cable systems, said that interest had declined over the past few years, except for a few megaevents.Across its 25 cards in 2017 and 2018, U.F.C. attracted 400,000 pay-per-view purchases — a threshold for what Berman considers substantial — only four times. U.F.C. events topped a million once, when Khabib Nurmagomedov defeated McGregor in October, according to MMAPayout.com, a website that tracks the business of mixed martial arts. In its 26 cards from 2015 to 2016, when Rousey and McGregor were fighting regularly, 13 pay-per-view bouts surpassed 400,000 purchases, and seven exceeded a million.“There’s so much content available that it becomes very difficult to differentiate between a lower-level pay-per-view and a fight that had been appearing on Fox or FS1,” Berman said. “If you’ve got three weeks of U.F.C. programming and two are available for free and one is $65, the one that’s $65 really has to stand out to pay that money. Without the big stars, it’s difficult to convince people to spend.”That’s especially true, Berman added, now that people are spending on other streaming services like Hulu, Netflix or DAZN and will have to determine whether they want to pay for another.“ESPN has that brand name and can build off that, but they’re not the only game in town,” Carter said.The best way, Zelaznik said, to distinguish U.F.C. — to make people care — is to identify fighters as personalities.Liddell knocked out people. Georges St-Pierre kept fans interested by defending his title nine consecutive times. Michael Bisping won a season of the reality television series “The Ultimate Fighter” — then won the middleweight title. If you don’t have a great fighter, Zelaznik said, you can’t make him a star.“That’s when you need the Conors of the world — the Brock Lesnars, even the Jon Joneses,” Zelaznik said. “Otherwise you’re just fishing in the same pond, repurposing all of your fans. You’ve got to grow in this space or you die.”"
"'Surreal' Pyongyang Marathon in Spotlight as Tensions Ease - The New York Times
(Reuters) - North Korea's Pyongyang marathon may be among the most complicated to enter but an easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula has made it a stage to highlight the power of sport amid growing interest for the race.Athletes can only register through one operator, Koryo Tours, for a chance to run through the capital of the reclusive state in the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, as the race is officially known.But close to 1,000 foreigners -- several hundred more than last year -- signed up in the sixth year foreign runners are allowed to compete on Sunday, according to officials, as tensions between North Korea and South Korea have eased since 2018.Among those running were two Olympians -- retired Swiss freestyle skier Mirjam Jaeger and British snowboarder Aimee Fuller -- who are part of a documentary produced by the Olympic Channel on the Pyongyang marathon and the pair's experience of the local sports culture.The Olympic Channel is a media operation of the International Olympic Committee and the documentary is set to air in September. ""The start (in Kim Il Sung Stadium) was very busy, the stadium completely full,"" Fuller, who took part in the 2014 and 2018 winter Olympics, told Reuters in a telephone interview from the North Korean capital.""It felt as if we were on a world stage competition. That was completely surreal. It was like the Olympics in an Olympic stadium.""Large crowds also lined the street at the start of this world athletics body IAAF-accredited bronze label road race with women wearing traditional costumes ready at refreshment stations.""Around mile 13 it definitely started to thin out. Having that unique opportunity to move from Pyongyang out into the countryside was really surreal.""Politics, however, is never too far away from the Pyongyang marathon, with visitors promised a tour of the capital's landmarks ""including a visit to the famous Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum and captured spy ship USS Pueblo."".U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have met twice in the past year to discuss denuclearization while North and South Korea are planning for a joint Olympics bid in 2032.Relations between the North and South greatly improved last year, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in meeting his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un at several summits.North Korea had for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions but the neighbors moved to thaw relations in 2018.""I would do it again. It was totally worth it,"" Jaeger, a 2014 Sochi Olympic participant, told Reuters.""I met so many different people. I know it from my 12-year career as a skier. Sports really has no borders.""

Calling it ""an error in judgment,"" Golden State Warriors forward Jordan Bell apologized Friday after he was suspended by the team Wednesday for ""conduct detrimental to the team.""Bell did not play in Golden State's Wednesday road game against the Memphis Grizzlies. The team did not provide details about the transgression while making the announcement of his suspension.After the team's shootaround Friday, Bell spoke with NBC Sports Bay Area.""I made an error of judgment,"" he said. ""And I thought I was doing something funny, and it wasn't.

"C.W.H.L. Folds, Leaving North America With One Women’s Hockey League - The New York Times
In a sudden blow to women’s professional sports in North America, the Canadian Women’s Hockey League announced on Sunday that it would discontinue operations on May 1.The C.W.H.L., founded in 2007, operated as a centrally funded, nonprofit enterprise. It included some of the sport’s biggest stars, like Hilary Knight and Marie-Philip Poulin.Laurel Walzak, chairwoman of the league’s board of directors, said that the C.W.H.L.’s management had realized in the past few weeks that funding would not be available to continue next season.“We realized this model is no longer viable in the economics and the future of the C.W.H.L.,” Walzak said. “We voted on this Friday night.”The C.W.H.L. had six teams spread across Canada, Massachusetts and China. Last weekend, it held its championship game, which was broadcast live in Canada and the United States. The C.W.H.L.’s closing leaves the National Women’s Hockey League, founded in 2015, as the only pro hockey option for women in North America.In recent years, players have pushed for a single league. The N.W.H.L., which has five teams in the United States, will look into becoming a new home for some of the almost 150 C.W.H.L. players who will soon be without a team.“We will pursue any and all opportunities to ensure the best players in Canada have a place to play,” said Dani Rylan, the founder and commissioner of the N.W.H.L. “Those conversations have started already and have quickly become a priority.”Sunday’s announcement shocked C.W.H.L. players, many of whom are Olympians for the United States and Canada and are in Finland preparing for the world championships. Poulin and other players tweeted a statement saying that they had been informed of the closing on Sunday morning and that it would be “hard to remain optimistic” that they would find a new home.In June 2017, the C.W.H.L. announced its expansion to China with the addition of two teams. The move was intended to present a wealth of sponsorship and other business opportunities. Beijing is preparing to host the 2022 Olympics, and the N.H.L. has made increasing its footprint in Asia a priority.Three months later, the C.W.H.L. began paying players for the first time. Under a salary cap of 100,000 Canadian dollars, player stipends ranged from $2,000 to $10,000. That figure was the same this season, but there were signs that the growth of the league was not as bountiful as had been expected, including the Chinese clubs’ merging into one franchise this season.Walzak and Jayna Hefford, who took over as interim commissioner when Brenda Andress left the organization last summer, said that China was a great opportunity for the league and that the clubs in Asia provided significant funding but that the expenses of running five North American teams, compounded with the exhaustive efforts to build sponsorships, ticket and merchandise sales in the United States and Canada, were straining the C.W.H.L. model.“The infrastructure wasn’t there to make it work,” said Brant Feldman, an agent who has represented several Olympic and pro women’s hockey players. “You need a full-time staff to go out and market the sport, sell tickets, do sponsorships, understand integrated marketing communications and operate the professional sport. Neither league has that.”Walzak said that the board was in the process of sorting out its finances from this season but that it expected that all payments owed would be made soon.The C.W.H.L. had relationships with several N.H.L. teams and the N.H.L. players’ association, but the N.H.L. has always appeared hesitant to embrace professional women’s hockey, choosing not to get in between the two North American leagues. Last November, W. Graeme Roustan, a noted investor in hockey ventures who said he was the largest investor in the league, announced that he was withdrawing his funding.In a statement on Sunday, an N.H.L. spokesman indicated that the news would not result in any changes from the league’s perspective. The statement said: “The N.H.L.’s position has been consistent for some time and remains unchanged with this news: we would consider starting a women’s league if there were no alternatives for women to play professionally in North America.”The N.H.L.P.A. also issued a statement, which said: “While this news is certainly disappointing — for the fans as well as the players — we hope that appropriate opportunities for these players will be available soon. We wish the players all the best.”Hefford said other stakeholders had expressed interest in continuing to help the sport. After the 2018 Olympics, American and Canadian players discussed the possibility of working together to reach the goal of a single league, but nothing materialized.Digit Murphy, a former coach in the C.W.H.L., said that women’s sports should not have to be dependent on men’s pro sports for resources and that the current pool of players was strong enough to produce a successful model."
"A Star’s Shoe Breaks, Putting College Basketball Under a Microscope - The New York Times
When the left sneaker of college basketball’s biggest star split open on national television Wednesday night 30 seconds into the biggest game of the season, what spilled out was not only his foot but also questions about the future of a marquee player and about the huge influence shoe companies hold over big-time college basketball.The episode occurred in a game between the archrivals Duke and North Carolina. Zion Williamson, a Duke freshman, pivoted with the ball above the foul line, and the sheer force of his 285-pound frame and acrobatic versatility appeared to cut the shoe almost in two, as though severed by a sharp knife.Former President Barack Obama, sitting on the sidelines at the Duke arena, was seen on video pointing at Williamson and appearing to say, “His shoe broke.”As the scene was replayed on countless highlight shows on Thursday, the damaged shoe threatened to become a nightmare for Nike, which pays tens of millions to elite college sports programs to be the exclusive sponsor for teams and supplier of their footwear.With his shoe split and his knee sprained, Williamson, an unpaid, budding superstar, sat helpless on the arena floor, staring at the shoe he was wearing in part because of a rich deal between Nike and Duke, one of the world’s wealthiest universities.Here were all the issues of big-time college sports laid bare: Should amateurism be curbed in college sports, allowing athletes a cut of the money they help produce? Should a prodigious talent like Williamson, who is good enough to play professionally right now, have to risk his future competing for free because of an N.B.A. rule prohibiting him from leaping to the league from high school? Do the sneaker companies, which were at the heart of a federal fraud trial near the start of the season, do more harm than good in college sports?For a quarter of a century, Nike has been paying Duke tens of millions of dollars to sponsor its teams, and to ensure that its athletes wear only footwear bearing the company’s ubiquitous logo. The players receive enough shoes to carry them through the season, allowing them to serve largely as free human billboards.“All this does,” Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane’s sports law program, said of Williamson’s injury, “is put a magnifying glass on an issue that has existed for a long time.”Williamson has not commented.Nike stock closed down Thursday by 1.05 percent, as the world wondered how a sneaker could split so badly in the middle of a game.The answer remains a puzzle even to experts. James Gilbert, an orthopedic surgeon who worked with Duke athletics in the 1990s, said he had seen shoes fall apart similarly on soccer players, but never on the hardwood.“I think it’s a product failure,” Gilbert said. “I’ve never seen that. I had no idea that that happens.”In a statement Wednesday night, Nike said: “We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery. The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.” The statement called the shoe explosion “an isolated occurrence,” though in 2015, the Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon even as the insoles of his Nike shoes slipped out of place.Williamson, who has a mild knee sprain, will probably be sidelined for one to two weeks, and then continue being the favorite to become the No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft in June. By then, he will probably already be a millionaire, because of the endorsement deals he can sign when he ends his college career. For now, he is an N.C.A.A. amateur.Sneaker companies first became deeply involved with college athletics in the late 1970s, when an enterprising Nike executive, Sonny Vaccaro, arranged for several prominent coaches, such as John Thompson of Georgetown and Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada-Las Vegas, to receive money in exchange for outfitting their players in the company’s shoes. Starting in the late 1980s, Nike began to sign deals that covered all of a university’s teams.“Now we see the kids wearing the shoes and selling the product all over the world — and the kids never got anything,” Vaccaro, who left Nike years ago, said Thursday. “The money has served the same people, except for the most important ones.”A decision in a federal class-action lawsuit challenging N.C.A.A. restrictions on compensation is expected any day.Standout basketball players were squeezed further in 2006, when the N.B.A. barred talented teenagers from following in the footsteps of Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James by entering the league straight out of high school.Then, in September 2017, federal prosecutors in New York’s Southern District revealed more of the chasm between college basketball players, who can receive only scholarships and related costs of being on campus, and the administrators and coaches who reap the benefits of the revenue the athletes generate for their colleges, conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. The men’s basketball tournament yields about $1 billion a year for the television rights.In three complaints filed in United States District Court in New York, prosecutors accused roughly a dozen assistant coaches, middlemen and employees of Adidas of plotting to funnel money to players’ families in exchange for pledges that the athletes, among other things, would play for certain universities and sign with Adidas once they began their pro careers. The scandal led to the firing of a Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino of the University of Louisville, and has netted three convictions, including of Adidas’s former director of global sports marketing.The transactions outlined by the complaints are practically the modus operandi at many top basketball programs, documents and testimony in the legal case suggested. Wiretaps revealed suspects describing at least one Adidas rival engaging in similar practices. Documents from the case reported by Yahoo Sports last year indicated that former top players at dozens of prominent programs — including Duke — had been on the payroll of an aspiring agent who has since been convicted of fraud.Duke did not reply to requests for comment Thursday.The specifics of Duke’s deal with Nike, which the two sides have extended through 2027, are not publicly known. As a private university, Duke is not obligated to reveal the terms.But a look at Nike deals with similar universities that are public offer some indication of how the contracts work.Nike’s deal with North Carolina, for instance, will give the university more than $90 million in cash and merchandise over 10 years. Nike also signed personal contracts with a number of North Carolina coaches: Roy Williams, the men’s basketball coach, will receive an average of $300,000 a year over the life of the 10-year agreement.Contracts generally state that Nike is not liable for injuries suffered by athletes wearing its products. The contracts also require every player to wear the company’s shoes unless a medical condition makes Nike footwear unsuitable. A player might, as stipulated in Nike’s deal with the University of Michigan, be required to make himself available for examination by Nike or a local podiatrist before using a shoe made by another company.It is not known why Williamson wore the particular Nike model that tore on Wednesday. It was a Nike “signature shoe,” a term for a style endorsed by a specific athlete — in this case, the N.B.A. star Paul George, who plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder.What makes Williamson so compelling is the same thing that might make a shoe unable to contain him. He combines size and speed with strength and agility in the manner of James, who during a day off this month went to Charlottesville, Va., to see Williamson and the Blue Devils take on Virginia. Though Williamson weighs 285 pounds, at times he seems like the fastest player on the court.“When you’re dealing with some of these athletes who are getting quicker, stronger, faster, you’ve got to consider some of that,” said Gilbert, the orthopedist."
"Muffet McGraw Says She Won’t Hire a Man on Her Coaching Staff. Let Her Tell You Why. - The New York Times
TAMPA, Fla. — Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw has been on the Final Four stage nine times in her career. She has answered hundreds of questions about her team, about her rivalry with Connecticut’s Geno Auriemma, about the state of women’s basketball. But her news conference on Thursday was different. It was passionate, and it was personal.Muffet McGraw has had enough.Enough of the declining percentage of women coaching women’s basketball teams. Enough of the limited female representation in Congress. Enough of confining gender roles. Enough of the gender pay gap.“Men run the world. Men have the power. Men make the decisions. It’s always the man that is the stronger one,” McGraw said, her voice rising in response to a question about saying in a recent ThinkProgress article that she would not hire another man for her coaching staff.“When these girls are coming out, who are they looking up to to tell them that’s not the way it has to be?” McGraw continued. “Where better to do that than in sports? All these millions of girls that play sports across the country, we’re teaching them great things about life skills, but wouldn’t it be great if we could teach them to watch how women lead?”In 1972, when the gender equity law known as Title IX was enacted, women were head coaches of more than 90 percent of the women’s college teams across two dozen sports. The percentage has decreased to about 40 now. The numbers are slightly better for women’s basketball, the most visible collegiate sport for women; about 59 percent of women’s college basketball teams were coached by women last year compared with 79 percent in 1977.Though the issue is not new, it has been especially prominent on the sport’s biggest stage this week. Tennessee has not been to a Final Four since 2008, but the program’s coaching vacancy has been widely discussed.Pat Summitt coached Tennessee for decades, building the program into a perennial powerhouse and making herself a leading figure in the sport. Holly Warlick, Summitt’s longtime assistant, took over when Summit left in 2012 because of early onset dementia. Warlick was fired last week, and Tennessee is conducting its first search for a women’s basketball coach in 45 years.When Louisville Coach Jeff Walz was mentioned as a candidate, a loud debate about the ramifications of that decision ensued. Would Tennessee hire a man to run the House that Pat Built? And should it matter if the coach is a man or a woman, as long as they’re qualified?McGraw said — loudly, pointedly — that it definitely matters.“When you look at men’s basketball, 99 percent of the jobs go to men, why shouldn’t 100 or 99 percent of the jobs in women’s basketball go to women?” she said. “Maybe it’s because we only have 10 percent women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people who look like them. That’s the problem.”McGraw’s comments also addressed topics like the failed Equal Rights Amendment and female representation in politics.“I’m getting tired of the novelty of the first female governor of this state, the first female African-American mayor of this city. When is it going to become the norm instead of the exception?” she said, adding: “We don’t have enough female role models. We don’t have enough visible women leaders. We don’t have enough women in power.”Notre Dame, the defending national champion, will meet UConn in a national semifinal on Friday night, the latest chapter in an intense rivalry that has played out on the court and in the news media for more than a decade. The assistants for both teams are all women.Aware of McGraw’s vow not to hire another man, Auriemma pulled no punches when he responded this week.“I hope she sends a thank you to all those guys that used to be on her staff that got her all those good players that won a championship,” he said.Auriemma’s leading recruiter for 34 seasons has been the associate head coach, Chris Dailey. While building teams that won 11 N.C.A.A. titles at Connecticut, Dailey has been offered countless head coaching jobs, but she stayed to sustain the Huskies’ success.“Women can be empowered by a lot of people, men included,” Dailey said after McGraw spoke on Thursday. “Opportunity for women is important, and it’s being brought to the forefront, which is amazing. But I do think you want good people in the game without excluding anyone.”Auriemma has long been an advocate for women in the sport, but he disagreed with the idea of limiting opportunities for men.“I just come at it from a different standpoint,” he said Thursday. “I just like to think that there’s probably a way to do one without the expense of another.”He pointed to Oregon Coach Kelly Graves, the other man coaching in the Final Four this weekend. “So they weren’t trying to advance women’s basketball or women by hiring Kelly? That was a bad move? They should have just found the best available woman?”"
"More Restrictions Are Placed on Youth Football in Canada - The New York Times
Canadian children age 12 and younger will no longer be able to play the fullest version of tackle football starting in 2022. The restriction was devised by Football Canada, the sanctioning body for youth football in the country, as the latest in a series of steps to protect players from concussions and potential long-term cognitive problems.Randy Ambrosie, the commissioner of the Canadian Football League, which works closely with Football Canada, announced the change Wednesday in Ottawa at a parliamentary hearing on concussions and sports.“While we enthusiastically support tackle football for older age groups, we are putting a huge emphasis on flag football for young girls and boys,” Ambrosie said.Football Canada has a number of categories for the versions of tackle football children can play and when they can do so. Already, children 8 or younger are not allowed to play tackle football. Children 10 and younger are allowed to play only six-on-six tackle football, or non-contact versions of the game, like flag football.The new rule for will prohibit children 12 and under from playing 12-on-12 football, the version of the game used in Canadian colleges and in professional leagues. Children from 10 to 12 years old will still be able to play six-on-six tackle football and nine-on-nine, as well as non-contact football.Some research has shown that people who started playing tackle football before age 12 were at greater risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, compared with those who started playing tackle football after age 12.In some ways, Canada has taken more steps to protect its players than the United States has. In 2017, for instance, the Canadian Football League barred players from deliberately slamming into one another during regular-season practices, and while they still wear helmets, they no longer wear shoulder pads and other protective gear in practices.The N.F.L. has reduced, but not eliminated, full-contact practices during the season. The Ivy League is the only United States college conference to have ended full-contact football practices in the regular season.The C.F.L. also added a third bye week to its 18-game calendar so there would be more time between games for players to recover.Ambrosie, who played nine seasons in the C.F.L. and became commissioner of the league in 2017, has accelerated the introduction of safety measures partly to ward off potential lawsuits, but also to restore confidence in the sport, which has been losing players faster than in the United States.The number of children in Canada playing tackle or non-contact forms of football has plummeted since 2010, to 100,000 from 170,000, according to government surveys and research by the C.F.L.“Support for football in this country is underwhelming and disappointing,” Ambrosie told lawmakers in the House of Commons Subcommittee on Sports-Related Concussions. “At times it can feel like it’s under attack.”"
"The N.C.A.A. Team That Just Can’t Win - The New York Times
LAS VEGAS — The knowing nods come as soon as the name John Higgins is mentioned to veteran college basketball officials. It could happen to any of us, they say, the way things are going.Higgins is one of the top referees in the sport. But it was during a taut N.C.A.A. tournament matchup in 2017 that he trended on Twitter and quickly became the target of harassment by frustrated Kentucky fans certain that Higgins was the reason that the Wildcats had lost a quarterfinal game against North Carolina.Higgins and his family received death threats, and his roofing-and-siding business received thousands of harassing phone calls (mostly from Kentucky area codes) and an onslaught of negative reviews, according to a lawsuit that Higgins later filed against a radio station he accused of fanning the discord.“While a basketball game is only played between two teams, there are three major groups of players at each game: the winning team, the losing team, and, increasingly visible with instant-replay on every television broadcast, the referees,” reads the lawsuit, which was dismissed in United States District Court on Wednesday, nearly 18 months after it was filed. (“Speech on matters of public concern in a public place is entitled to special First Amendment protection,” the judge wrote.)As the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament begins this week, the only team certain to reach the Final Four wears black-and-white striped jerseys with no numbers. It is likely that some referees will be accused of incompetence. Others can expect to be blamed for game outcomes somewhere along the way.“We’re under the highest amount of scrutiny we’ve ever been under,” said Mike Reed, a Division I official since 1994 now entering his 13th N.C.A.A. tournament.It is not just college basketball. Officials have become leading characters in the passion play of American sports: an overlooked pass-interference hubbub in the recent N.F.L. playoffs; the overturned foul after Kevin Durant smashed into LeBron James in last year’s N.B.A. finals; or disputes about home runs in Major League Baseball’s playoffs.In tennis, the 2018 United States Open may be remembered for Serena Williams’s reactions to officiating calls in the women’s final as much as for the play of the winner, Naomi Osaka. Even umpires at last year’s Little League World Series were not immune.Barry Mano, a former college basketball official who founded Referee magazine in 1975 and the National Association of Sports Officials in 1980, sees the magnifying glass as a mirror to society.“Now officiating is public and, in some ways, a petri dish in which the culture of sports and our larger culture gets agitated, stirred together,” he wrote in the latest issue of Referee.In few places do officials work in such a high-speed pressure cooker like that of a college basketball arena. Unlike their N.B.A. counterparts, highly paid coaches are the faces of the college game and the main mouthpieces to the referees, and allegiant fans follow their lead. Lightning-quick decisions are untangled by slow-motion replays on screens in the arena and on television for those watching at home. Victories can mean big financial rewards for coaches and colleges. Social media spreads angst in real time.“The speed of information is causing referees to be more visible,” said J.D. Collins, the N.C.A.A.’s national coordinator of men’s basketball officials. “Our best hope is to have us be invisible, do our job and go home. But I’m afraid we are no longer in that environment.”In 2017, 57 percent of officials of all sports at all levels said that sportsmanship was getting worse (16 percent said it was getting better), according to a survey by the sports officials' association of more than 17,000 officials. The numbers were grimmer in basketball, in which 65 percent said sportsmanship was declining.“Sports is simply life with the volume turned up,” Mano said in an interview. “Why should we be surprised by this? We’re louder, we’re brasher. We don’t want to be told no. When we don’t like a decision, we look for another opinion. That’s how we got replay.”Yet even as the light on officiating gets harsher, an analysis of all N.C.A.A. tournament games last year found that officials made the right call 94.75 percent of the time when they blew their whistles, Collins said. No calls, where no whistle was blown on close plays, were correct about 90 percent of the time, he added.To watch and listen to the exasperated reactions from coaches and fans, however, the proportion of blown calls feels more like 50-50.“The expectation is that you start out perfect,” said Reed, the N.C.A.A. tournament referee, “and you get better from there.”This season, the N.C.A.A. put a renewed focus on bench decorum, hoping to clamp down on the boorish behavior of coaches — who might set an example for fans. Coaches are restricted to a short stretch of sideline where they often pace impatiently, like caged cats, while barking incessantly, like neighborhood dogs.The emphasis has not prevented several noteworthy episodes in recent weeks, as when Mississippi Coach Kermit Davis shed his coat and threw it down in disgust after a call late in a game, leading fans to throw garbage on the court. (Last week, Davis was named the Southeastern Conference’s coach of the year.) The same night, East Carolina Coach Joe Dooley was ejected with two technicals against Houston. One of his players followed by getting thrown out, too, as was one of the fans throwing garbage toward the court.At Iowa last month, Coach Fran McCaffery was suspended by his university for two games for berating an official in a hallway after a loss.At the Pac-12 Conference tournament in Las Vegas, Utah’s Larry Krystkowiak got a technical on Friday when he swatted a water cup on press row. A few blocks away at the Mountain West Conference tournament, New Mexico Coach Paul Weir received a momentum-shifting technical when he rushed down the sideline after a questionable call.Moments later, fans filled the arena with a chant: “You suck, ref!”“I don’t know the exact rule on that — maybe he’s right,” Weir said. “I was just voicing my displeasure on a play. I think coaches get that way a lot.”The N.C.A.A., which said it had not tracked the number of technicals called this season compared with previous years, tried to set a consistent standard heading into the national tournament.“Part of the responsibility of a coach is to let an official know when we either miss a call or they think we miss a call,” Collins said. “But based on the 90-to-95 percent figure, it isn’t every call.”There are 851 Division I men’s basketball officials, each of them an independent contractor working for a handful of regional coalitions. They make roughly $1,350 to $3,800 per game, depending on their experience and the matchup. (Kentucky’s John Calipari, the highest-paid coach in college basketball, made about $281,000 per game this season, if his nearly $9.3 million annual salary is divided by the 33 games Kentucky has played.) There are no benefits, and officials are generally not reimbursed for travel or other costs. While most referees do it as a part-time job from late fall to early spring, a few dozen officiate as their primary income, stringing together several games each week, maybe 80 or more games a season.And just as teams hope to be picked for the 68-team N.C.A.A. tournament, officials hoped to be among the 100 selected to work the games. The best advance to the next round.“All of us want to go to the Final Four,” said Tony Padilla, a longtime official who made it there in 2016 and 2017. “It’s funny, because then you’re under more scrutiny and under the microscope more than any time. It’s kind of weird, right?”They will go through more ups and downs than any team. They will draw the ire of nearly everyone watching. But referees will be there at the end, the tournament’s only sure bet.“We don’t have any home games, and we don’t have a student section cheering for us,” said Randy McCall, a Division I referee since 1992 who regularly works deep into the tournament. “It can be a grind, especially late in the year. But I chose this. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”The next night, McCall officiated a Pac-12 semifinal game between Arizona State and Oregon. Both teams have coaches who pace and bark. When they stand still they merely look perplexed or agitated.The game was a testy one, headed to overtime, between teams desperate to reach the N.C.A.A. tournament. In the second half, McCall called a foul on an Arizona State player who blocked a shot. The Sun Devils’ coach, Bobby Hurley, was enraged. Replays on the enormous video board sent Hurley into a frenzy. Fans howled at the officials.A night earlier, as cheers from a nearby game swirled into a dim arena hallway, McCall had discussed the occasional blown call, and the outrage that was sure to follow one.“The only times I really remember when I look back over my career are the mistakes I made — the mistakes that were critical mistakes, at critical times of a game, that maybe changed the outcome,” McCall said. “And I don’t need to read anything on social media to know, believe me.”"
"How Tom Brady Became New England’s Favorite Adopted Son - The New York Times
Tom Brady, the five-time Super Bowl champion quarterback of the New England Patriots, came to Massachusetts via San Mateo, Calif., and the University of Michigan.He is married to the supermodel Gisele Bündchen and has owned a luxury apartment in Manhattan, where their family spent much time in the off-season. He endorses UGG, the Australian apparel company, and he published a book about his life as a diet and health nut whose favorite dessert is a dairy-free avocado ice cream, a flavor not readily available at J.P. Licks or any other popular Boston ice cream haven.Despite all of this, which would figure to turn off the people in a region known, perhaps unfairly, for its insularity and, perhaps fairly, for its hatred of pretension, Brady is now the most favorite son of New England. How he managed to pull that off, to become bigger than Ted Williams and Larry Bird, and even Big Papi, David Ortiz, has more to do with timing, some key lifestyle decisions and a certain fight with the N.F.L. over deflated footballs than his mounting collection of Super Bowl rings.“If you were drawing a sports cartoon and it showed a train and each car in the train represented one of the recent Boston championships,” said Richard Johnson, the curator of the Sports Museum in Boston, “Brady would be the engineer in the front stoking the fire.”Fans in 44 American states mostly despise Brady and pray to the football gods that his Patriots never win another playoff game. But in New England, it’s almost impossible to overstate Brady’s exalted standing. Putting Brady on par with a Kennedy might be a stretch, but not a huge one.It’s also remarkable that at the end of a season that dawned with the potential for polarizing protests during the national anthem, sagging television ratings and other off-field controversies, it has instead all come back to Brady and his dominance. After nearly two decades, the N.F.L. remains his playground.Partly because of that, the people of the New England region, who largely adopt all Boston teams, are living through an era of unusually high accomplishment: Their professional teams celebrate championships from season to season — as in spring to fall to winter. But in Boston, it always matters to have been the one who started a movement. And like Paul Revere dashing on horseback to ignite a revolution, Brady led the charge that ushered New England sports into the 21st century, and it has been a procession of duck-boat parades down Boylston Street past Boston Common ever since.[An illustrated guide to the N.F.L. playoffs.]Brady’s Patriots won the franchise’s first Super Bowl title at the end of the 2001 N.F.L. season. That was about three years before the 2004 Red Sox reversed the curse with their first World Series victory since 1918, and long before the 2008 Celtics finally escaped Bird’s shadow and won their first N.B.A. championship in more than 20 years. And it was a decade before the 2011 Bruins won the franchise’s first Stanley Cup since 1972.Throughout that time, Brady’s Patriots kept winning. And while there have been other recent, treasured sports heroes in Boston, most notably the still ubiquitous Ortiz, consider this: When the origin story of Boston’s 21st century sports resurrection is told, whose name will be mentioned first?Brady managed to ingratiate himself to the locals quickly when he arrived in 2000. His first home, symbolically, was in Quincy, Mass., a diverse city-suburb where two New England institutions, Dunkin’ Donuts and Howard Johnson’s restaurants, were founded.He was a familiar sight back then, piling groceries in a cart and chatting with other customers at the Quincy Stop & Shop. Restaurants and bars there grew accustomed to seeing him on dates, and even grew protective of him when those outings attracted paparazzi.Another factor that made Brady not just a favorite son of the region but the focal point of a rebellious, us-against-them cause was the bizarre spectacle that came to be known as Deflategate. Not surprisingly, us-against-them has been ingrained in the New England DNA ever since a lot of tea ended up in Boston Harbor about 246 years ago.In 2015, when Brady and the Patriots were investigated by the N.F.L. for using deflated footballs to gain an unfair advantage — with Brady eventually suspended and, by association, labeled a cheater (in roughly 44 states) — New Englanders were outraged by what they saw as outsiders’ bias.“The allegiance to Brady is deep and all the more intense because of the shared feeling he was unfairly stigmatized,” said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author, historian and longtime New England resident. “Deflategate put Brady’s entire reputation and legacy at risk. Fans here still battle the nonissue with fans elsewhere, and it makes us love him all the more.”Goodwin added that she was recently at a bar in the Philadelphia airport, and everyone except her and one other patron wanted Brady to lose on Sunday.During Deflategate, there was an infamous, ghoulish 2015 courtroom sketch made of Brady as he took part in a federal proceeding. Patriots fans were incensed that the handsome Brady had been rudely denigrated.The courtroom artist apologized repeatedly and created another, more favorable sketch.There are, of course, two other obvious reasons that Brady’s status in New England has been amplified, and they would probably bring him unbridled admiration in any pro sports community.He holds the records for most N.F.L. victories as a starting quarterback (207), most playoff wins (29), most Super Bowl victories by a player (five) and most Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Awards (four).That will breed a lot of loyalty. Brady, for example, is 41 and has been in the N.F.L. for 19 years. You might think that any fan who wanted a replica of his No. 12 jersey would have purchased one by now.Apparently not.Merchandise bearing Brady’s name was the top-selling N.F.L. apparel item this season, with the Boston market driving sales. Since the Patriots clinched their berth in Sunday’s Super Bowl, Brady merchandise has been selling faster — by 40 percent — than it did in the week before any of his previous eight Super Bowl appearances, according to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports merchandise.He is also married to one of the highest paid models in the world. There is little doubt that part of Brady’s crossover appeal is the understanding that he is the rare N.F.L. superstar whose spouse may be more famous than he is.Brady is chasing his sixth Super Bowl championship and seems to have secured his spot on the Boston sports version of Mount Rushmore. There is still room there for Williams, Bill Russell and (genuflect) Bobby Orr. Fans of Bird will make their case.But the only person who could possibly unseat Brady is Bill Belichick, who admittedly already has a face of stone. He first landed in New England as a teenager during a postgraduate year at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., then attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.Realistically, no one is likely to eclipse Brady. Two years ago, a Boston cultural museum unveiled a Brady wax figure (next to dozens of nonsports icons of the area). The representation of Brady was deemed creepy, and elicited more ire and wrath than the unworthy courtroom sketch did.Which means only one thing: In five or 10 years, when civic leaders erect a Tom Brady statue, they better get the visage right.

Larry Baer, the chief executive of the San Francisco Giants, has been suspended without pay until July over a video that shows him involved in a public altercation with his wife, the commissioner of Major League Baseball announced on Tuesday.Mr. Baer has been on a leave of absence from the team since March 4, time away that the league said would now be converted to an unpaid suspension. During the approximately four-month suspension, which goes through July 1, Mr. Baer “shall have no involvement in the operations of the Giants.” The team will be put under the control of someone selected by the team’s ownership group, a statement from Major League Baseball said.In the meantime, Mr. Baer must be evaluated by an expert to determine an appropriate treatment and counseling plan, the statement said.The baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, said league investigators had reviewed video footage of the March 1 episode, in which Mr. Baer was seen lunging for a cellphone in his wife’s hand and forcefully grabbing her. They struggled, and she fell to the ground.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Manfred said that he had met with Mr. Baer and that he had concluded that Mr. Baer’s conduct was “unacceptable under M.L.B. policies and warrants discipline.”“In determining the appropriate level of discipline, I find that Mr. Baer should be held to to a higher standard because as a leader he is expected to be a role model for others in his organization and community,” Mr. Manfred said. “Based on my conversation with Mr. Baer, it is clear he regrets what transpired and takes responsibility for his conduct.”The board of the San Francisco Giants, speaking on behalf of the team’s ownership, said in a statement that it believed the discipline imposed by the commissioner was appropriate. The team said that its acting chief executive, Rob Dean, would serve as the interim “control person” until it designates someone permanently.Mr. Baer, who in addition to leading the Giants’ executive office is one of the team’s principal owners, will continue to serve as the team’s chief executive and president after he returns from his suspension, the team added.“I respect and accept the commissioner’s decision,” Mr. Baer said in his own statement. “I made a serious mistake that I sincerely regret and I am truly sorry for my actions.”The punishment came as the sports world waits to see how the N.F.L.’s commissioner will reprimand the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, who has been accused of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. Mr. Kraft pleaded not guilty to two first-degree misdemeanor charges late last month.The situation involving Mr. Baer and the allegations against Mr. Kraft have drawn attention to how team owners and executives are punished after being accused of misconduct, compared with players, for whom fines and suspensions may carry a greater impact.After video of the encounter, which was first posted by TMZ Sports, surfaced publicly this month, Mr. Baer and his wife, Pam, initially issued statements denying that a physical altercation had taken place. The video appeared to show them arguing in a public plaza. Ms. Baer sat in a chair, and her husband stood next to her. And then Mr. Baer was seen lunging toward her, grabbing her and setting off the struggle, during which she fell to the ground and screamed, “Oh my God!”The police and Major League Baseball quickly pledged to investigate what had taken place and Mr. Baer apologized. Three days after the confrontation, the Giants announced that Mr. Baer would take a leave of absence from his job as chief executive.In mid-March, a coalition of women’s groups posted an open letter online that called on Mr. Manfred to commit to “firm and appropriate action in disciplining” Mr. Baer. The mayor of San Francisco, London N. Breed, endorsed the call for a serious penalty.After the suspension was announced, the coalition, #DoWhatsRightMLB, said it appreciated Mr. Manfred’s reprimand.“M.L.B. is showing why it is regarded as a leader in advancing cultural change in professional sports by not tolerating violence against women,” the coalition said in a statement.Ms. Breed agreed, saying in a statement that the league had “sent a clear message that violence against women is unacceptable in any form.”Last week, the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office determined that the evidence in the case did not support filing criminal charges against Mr. Baer, a spokesman said Tuesday.Mr. Baer joined the Giants as the club’s marketing director in 1980, left the team to attend Harvard Business School and then served in positions at Westinghouse Broadcasting and CBS, according to a biography.He returned to the team as a limited partner of the ownership group, and was named chief operating officer in May 1996, president in October 2008 and chief executive in January 2012."
"England Soccer Manager Southgate Honoured at Buckingham Palace - The New York Times
LONDON — England football manager Gareth Southgate received the OBE award at Buckingham Palace on Thursday after steering the national team to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia last Summer.Southgate, 48, dressed in his trademark waistcoat, was presented the award for services to football by Prince Charles after he was included in Queen Elizabeth's 2019 New Year's honours list. ""It's very special,"" he told Sky Sports TV after the ceremony. ""It's a privilege to be the English manager and to receive an award from the royal family - as a proud royal fan, that was very special. It's a moment that will live with me for ever.""Last month, team captain Harry Kane received the MBE award. He was top scorer with six goals in Russia but the team was knocked out after a 2-1 loss to Croatia in the semi-finals.Southgate's OBE came as England climbed one place to fourth in FIFA's latest world rankings after Euro 2020 qualifying victories over the Czech Republic and Montenegro.

"Top Qatari Soccer Official Barred From Tournament in U.A.E. - The New York Times
LONDON — The diplomatic standoff between Qatar and its Arab neighbors spilled into the sports world once again Thursday as a Qatari vice president of Asia’s soccer confederation was barred from traveling to the United Arab Emirates ahead of the region’s top tournament.Saoud al-Mohannadi, vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, was denied permission to travel from Oman to the U.A.E. after airport officials said he wouldn’t be let into the country. The U.A.E., with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other Mideast countries, broke diplomatic relations and severed all ties with Qatar in 2017.Mohannadi is the chairman of the A.F.C.’s competitions committee, a group with overall responsibility for the Asian Cup. Prohibiting him from traveling to the U.A.E. is the first sign that long-simmering political tensions in the Gulf are likely to have ramifications for continent’s biggest tournament.Mohannadi immediately wrote a letter of complaint to Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini royal who is the A.F.C.’s current president. The organization said in a statement that it was aware of reports that Mohannadi was being denied the right to travel and that it would investigate. The A.F.C. said it had been “assured of visas and entry permits” for tournament organizing committee members and executives.The Saudi-led diplomatic dispute with Qatar included the suspension of flights between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several other countries. Only recently have Qatari citizens been allowed to apply for permission to travel between the two countries. Such travel typically requires a visa and an approval letter from local authorities.Mohannadi, who in 2017 successfully managed to overturn a one-year FIFA ethics ban, had applied to enter the U.A.E. Local organizers told him he could travel there even though he had not received official clearance, according to people familiar with the matter. He traveled from Doha to Muscat, Oman’s capital, where he was told his clearance was not registered.The soccer federation in Qatar, which will host the World Cup in 2022, said in a statement that it had reached out to the A.F.C. about the matter. “We will comment further once we have an official response on the incident,” the federation said.The diplomatic dispute, which exploded in the spring of 2017, has already impacted regional sports. Players and officials on teams from countries opposed to Qatar initially refused to speak to beIN Sports, the Qatari-owned network that owns the rights to the A.F.C.’s events. For much of the past year, BeoutQ, a bootlegging television network, has been unimpeded in broadcasting pirated beIN Sports events using a satellite operator based in Saudi Arabia.BeoutQ was launched in response to the governments of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. blocking the sale of beIN Sports as part of a blockade that has closed off air and sea access between the countries.Mohannadi’s travel plans are unlikely to be the last flashpoint in the 24-team tournament that kicks off on Saturday. The draw, made in May, set up a match between foes Qatar and Saudi Arabia on Jan. 17. It’s unlikely many, if any, Qatari supporters will make the trip to Abu Dhabi.“That’s almost more difficult to imagine than the U.S. national soccer team playing Iran in Tehran,” said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House, a British foreign affairs think tank. “There will be some jittery people in Qatar hoping their players make it home.”Mohannadi is one of two candidates who will be challenging Sheikh Salman for the A.F.C.’s presidency later this year. The other candidate is Mohammed Khalfan al-Romaithi, a sports official from the U.A.E."
"Ohio State DE Bosa to Visit Cardinals - The New York Times
Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa is scheduled to visit the Arizona Cardinals, with speculation mounting he could be the No. 1 pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.Bosa met with team officials in Florida on Friday and is now set for a second sitdown at the team facility. Bosa and the Cardinals have a ""top 30"" visit scheduled with four weeks remaining until the 2019 draft.Each NFL franchise is permitted to host 30 prospects at team headquarters.Bosa will be in Arizona on Thursday night for a Friday visit this week, Sports Illustrated first reported Monday.The younger brother of Chargers pass rusher Joey Bosa, Nick Bosa missed half of last season with an abdominal injury. He's working out with his brother in Florida and did not take part in workouts during his pro day.Hosting Nick Bosa gives the Cardinals the opportunity to gauge his recovery on the field.He said last week he was intrigued by the possibility of pairing with Cardinals outside linebacker Chandler Jones.--Field Level Media"
"March Madness’s Toughest Matchup: Brackets vs. Ethics - The New York Times
Jack Bowen is an author of a book on sports and ethics, and teaches high school courses on ethics and philosophy. When it came time to fill out a bracket for the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament for a pool at work this year, he did not feel right about it.Given the scandals that plague college basketball, including several teams and coaches that have advanced to this week’s round of 16 games, not filling out a bracket was one ethicist’s form of quiet protest.“I chose not to do the men’s bracket, but I am doing the women’s bracket,” Bowen said, and he laughed at the questionable line he drew. “Now, what have I done here?”What are any of us doing here?Every March, millions of Americans fill out brackets (more than 40 million people, by one count), cheer the underdogs and tune in on television. Others buy tickets to the games, wear jerseys of their favorite teams and let wins and losses dictate their mood.Yet fans who follow college basketball closely know about the game’s intractable relationship to corruption. Even many who come just for March Madness must know that the real madness is not always on the court.A wide-ranging and fear-inducing F.B.I. investigation into college basketball recruiting continues to ensnare big-name colleges and little-known crooks. It is why Louisiana State, for example, is playing without its head coach, Will Wade, and why Auburn recently had an assistant coach suspended and a former assistant plead guilty of conspiracy for accepting bribes.This week, the lawyer Michael Avenatti was charged with trying to extort up to $25 million from Nike in exchange for concealing information he had about illicit payments to recruits. He has since revealed some allegations on Twitter. Among them: Oregon’s injured center Bol Bol was paid to join the Ducks, he said. Oregon, one of the 16 teams still in the tournament, denied the allegation.“We go through periods of cleansing, where we all start to think something’s not quite right,” Jim Haney, the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, said. “College basketball is now going through one of those periods. In the best interests of the game, sometimes you have to go through these because you’re not able to do it on your own.”For fans, as much as ever, this N.C.A.A. tournament serves as a taste test for our unholy appetites.It is called “moral dissonance,” Bowen said, “where someone thinks, ‘Gosh, this is unethical, but I love it so much, and my friends and I have such a good time rooting and cheering that I’m going to participate anyway.’”Steven Mintz, a professor emeritus at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo who writes a blog called Ethics Sage, called it “ethical blindness.”“Some people say, ‘We can live with this, simply for the love of the game,’” Mintz said.Such internal debates permeate our culture. Is it O.K. to dance to a Michael Jackson song, to laugh to a Louis C.K. joke, to watch a movie produced by Harvey Weinstein? To cheer for football knowing what it may be doing to players’ brains?In this case, is it O.K. to fill out brackets, root for winners and perhaps invest financially in programs that run afoul of rules, knowing what we know while, perhaps reasonably, suspecting worse?“We do have these quandaries that we face, and it’s important for us to think about them,” said Shawn Klein, who teaches philosophy and sports ethics at Arizona State. “Even if our conclusions about how we should act don’t necessarily change how we do act, it’s important that we’re aware of the balance we have here.”The topic in college basketball is an old one, freshened by the latest news. Louisiana State has the familiar ingredients of a championship contender: a premier point guard, a bevy of tall underclassmen looking to leave for the N.B.A. and a hint of scandal.Seeded third in the East Region, and led by the interim coach Tony Benford, Louisiana State squeezed past 14th-seeded Yale in the first round, then slipped past sixth-seeded Maryland in the second. Next it faces second-seeded Michigan State. A victory might get Louisiana State a Sunday date with No. 1 Duke for a spot in the Final Four.Louisiana State’s season began in tragedy, with the shooting death of one of its players, Wayde Sims, on the eve of preseason practices. Now it climaxes in the most N.C.A.A. way possible, with each victory treated as either a feel-good story of redemption or a cautious tale of corruption.“Whatever has happened to sour this L.S.U. season, it is all forgotten for now,” the Baton Rouge Advocate columnist Scott Rabalais wrote over the weekend.It might be a mantra for most teams through the annual tournament.As Sports Illustrated pointed out last week, the teams with the most Final Four appearances in history are North Carolina, U.C.L.A., Kentucky, Duke and Kansas. But next on the list, if it were a university, would be Vacated — the euphemism given to appearances later wiped from the record by scandal.It is easy to imagine Vacated making a future run in this year’s tournament.A yearslong F.B.I. investigation burst into public view in late 2017, exposing the type of black-market underbelly long presumed in college sports, especially men’s basketball. At its heart were top-tier men’s basketball programs, shoe manufacturers and prized recruits, along with the sticky web of middlemen that laced so many of them together. Ten men were arrested, including assistant coaches for four top programs.Waves from the investigation continue to wash detritus to shore as cases flow through the court system. A year ago, Yahoo Sports reported that the F.B.I.’s investigation had implicated at least 25 programs. Among them were six members of this year’s round of 16, including three No. 1 seeds — Duke, North Carolina and Virginia — and second-seeded Kentucky.So far, none have been publicly outed for transgressions related directly to the F.B.I. case, but at least one entire region will be contested this weekend with teams playing under an ethical cloud.In addition to North Carolina, which avoided punishment in a massive academic-fraud case only by threading a legal needle, the rest of the four-team Midwest Region includes fifth-seeded Auburn, whose coach, Bruce Pearl, was fired by Tennessee in 2011 after he lied during an N.C.A.A. investigation; third-seeded Houston, coached by Kelvin Sampson, who spent years in exile after being forced out at Oklahoma and Indiana over recruiting violations; and Kentucky, whose coach, John Calipari, led two programs later forced to vacate Final Four appearances.Not all coaches and programs in the field have been similarly tainted, but their mere presence at the top of the sport clouds them with suspicion. Paying college athletes is a popular idea waved like a magic wand, as if that would forgive the rule-breaking under the current system and not create complex logistical and ethical problems of a different sort.Little of this conversation ever breaks through the cheers surrounding the N.C.A.A. tournament. It is rarely discussed earnestly on CBS, which is paying the N.C.A.A. nearly $1 billion a year, on average, to televise the tournament through 2032.The issue for fans, especially this time of year, is a matter of complicity. Does supporting certain teams, or an entire enterprise known to foster unethical behavior — including, some argue, not sharing its financial riches with its labor force — condemn those who watch, cheer or fill in brackets?Klein, the philosophy lecturer at Arizona State, said we live in a “culture of outrage,” with societal pressures to disengage from everything some find troubling.“It seems an overburdened obligation that we know the moral status of every aspect of every institution and everything we participate in, and are able to figure out the proper balance to decide whether or not we should interact with it,” Klein said. “That’s just not doable.”Allegiances to teams are “an identity issue,” he said, “part of how you see yourself,” not unlike a long-term relationship with family and friends. Fans of certain teams, even if those teams are clouded in controversy, tend to defend them, even if their vision is viewed through team-colors-tinted glasses.“When something happens that you think is wrong, that you’re morally critical of, you don’t necessarily walk away from that relationship,” Klein said.At some point, of course, maybe you do. But Haney, from the National Association of Basketball Coaches, holds a similar view.“Just as you can have a friend who’s done something to you, but because you like them, you love them, you stay with them,” Haney said. “You don’t turn your back on them, knowing that change is coming.”“Fandom is not a rational pursuit from the get-go,” said Bowen, who helped write “Sport, Ethics and Leadership,” a textbook. “The joy is that it’s an emotional experience, a great getaway. We want that. But on the flip side, emotion hijacks reason all the time.”By the way, while he did not participate in his office pool for the men’s tournament, Bowen said he and his children filled out brackets at home.It is complicated. Maybe like the bracket itself, no one gets it exactly right."
"How Virginia Has Coped With a One-of-a-Kind Loss - The New York Times
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — There are two ways, said the sports psychologist Michael Gervais, for a team to respond to the stress that comes when thoughts of a particularly painful defeat are dredged up.One is to think about situations in which the dreadful memory will re-emerge and face it down, talk about it, plan how to respond.The other is to move on. Period.“For some people,” Gervais said, the latter option “is the correct choice.”“For most of us,” he added, “that seems fine until we get close to the environment that feels or smells or looks like the first environment.” At which point, he said, it becomes apparent that things should have been thought through a little more.The Virginia men’s basketball team is approaching such a situation. In the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament last year, the Cavaliers had a meteor land on them. They became the only No. 1 men’s seed ever to lose to a No. 16, falling to the Retrievers of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, by 20 points.Now, here they go again: Top-seeded Virginia will meet the No. 16 Gardner-Webb Runnin’ Bulldogs (more frisky canines) on Friday in Columbia, S.C.Last year’s loss initially devastated Virginia’s players. Kyle Guy, a guard who is now a junior, wrote a moving Facebook post in which he described walking around campus knowing that everyone knew why he was wearing a hoodie and sunglasses. “There aren’t many people who know what it’s like to be the ONLY person (program in this instance) in the world to be on the wrong side of history,” he wrote.But six months after that, in Charlotte, N.C., for a media day, Guy was singing a different tune — in the same building, no less, where the awful upset had occurred. “For me, it’s never forgetting it,” he said, “but definitely trying to move past it to where I’m not hanging my head.”This month, in Charlotte again for the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament, Coach Tony Bennett seemed to reject inquiries about Last Year.“We’ve grown from that experience,” he told reporters. “We’ve owned it. We’ve talked about it. We had a great year last year and a hard loss. But it’s time to press on, and there’s not any more to say about that.”Through a spokesman, Bennett declined a request to discuss last year’s tournament loss in an interview. In other words, Virginia appears to have chosen Gervais’s Option B.Fans aren’t quite there, at least not those interviewed before and during the Cavaliers’ final regular season game, a win over Louisville. They had not quite moved on.“I want people to stop talking about losing to a 16th seed,” said Nicole Vaughan, a fan waiting to watch the game at a sports bar that had been converted from a train station not far from the university’s John Paul Jones Arena.For some, the demons that Virginia will face Friday originated before the upset by the Retrievers.Virginia’s basketball pedigree — two Final Fours in the 1980s and a tremendous recent run — looks impressive until measured against the achievements of A.C.C. rivals past and present, like Maryland, Duke and North Carolina.The greatest Cavalier ever, Ralph Sampson, was a three-time college player of the year and a No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick who took Virginia to a Final Four but never won a conference tournament. His teams were stymied by the great Tar Heels squads of Michael Jordan and James Worthy, and by North Carolina State’s miracle national champions of 1983.As the Cavaliers have won or shared four regular-season A.C.C. titles during the last several years under Bennett, there has been a string of N.C.A.A. tournament disappointments. Last year’s loss was the third time Virginia had been defeated as a No. 1 seed.“Part of their depression, for lack of a better word,” Jerry Ratcliffe, a longtime local sports journalist, said, referring to the fans, “went back to when they lost to a really good Michigan State team in Madison Square Garden a few years ago, and they felt like that team was Final Four material. And the collapse against Syracuse a couple years ago — that definitely was a Final Four team.”Then, too, there was the style of last year’s defeat. Virginia found itself trailing early in the second half, and Bennett’s team, famous for a careful, slow style of play that critics say makes it susceptible to upsets, failed to erase the deficit.“Now you have to hear it forever,” said Tyler Pearson, another patron at the restaurant to watch the regular season finale. “Everything they said is true: The system doesn’t work; if you fall behind, you can’t come back; Tony is stubborn.”This year’s Cavaliers are almost certainly better than the team that lost to U.M.B.C. They had just two regular-season losses, both to Duke, the tournament’s top overall seed. They retained most of their leading players from last season while adding Braxton Key, a transfer from Alabama, and the freshman Kihei Clark. De’Andre Hunter, a sophomore who did not play in the U.M.B.C. game because of a broken wrist, might be this season’s national player of the year if Duke’s Zion Williamson did not exist. And he is healthy.So how to view the upset loss to Florida State in the A.C.C. tournament semifinals last weekend? Perhaps it will be a boon, one player suggested, providing Virginia with a scare to motivate it.“I remember we cut down the nets in the A.C.C. tournament last year, and we didn’t like the way our season ended,” guard Ty Jerome said after the A.C.C. semifinal, making only a glancing reference to the loss that shall not be named. “This isn’t the end-all, be-all by any means.”Payton Souders, a student whose parents are alumni, said she thought the consensus about Virginia is that it’s a “really experienced team.”Sipping a beer not long after the score of a U.M.B.C. game flashed on the television, Pearson made something close to a promise.“Put all your money on Virginia that first game,” he said. “Nobody’s ever lost to a 16 seed two years in a row.”Souders is running the bracket pool that her sorority, Alpha Chi Omega, puts on every year for charity. She has found that many of the hundreds of entrants have picked the Cavaliers to win the whole tournament.“I’ve been a little cynical,” she said in a text this week, “and people have gotten a little mad at me for it.”"

"For a Mike Trout, M.L.B. Flaunts Its Wealth. Average Players Reap Austerity. - The New York Times
The best way to understand Mike Trout, the outfielder for baseball’s Los Angeles Angels, who on Tuesday reportedly agreed to the richest contract in North American sports, is as the perfect reflection of his sport.Little known to many Americans, including some sports fans, Trout, 27, is the best player in a game that has frequently been mocked as a fading form of entertainment with primarily regional audiences.Baseball is often dismissed as far less enticing than the N.F.L., which is believed to bring in more than $14 billion annually even with its health and safety issues. Baseball also is called less dynamic than the N.B.A., even though it had about $2 billion less in revenue than M.L.B. last year.So when Trout’s 12-year, $430 million contract was revealed, it prompted an obvious question: How could a sport that is struggling to attract a new generation of fans, and that is facing a potentially bruising labor fight with its players in two years, afford yet another nine-figure contract?News of Trout’s deal came about three weeks after outfielder Bryce Harper accepted a 13-year, $330 million contract  with the Phillies and a month after infielder Manny Machado got a 10-year, $300 million deal from the San Diego Padres.The answer has more to do with the mechanics of the collective bargaining agreement between players and owners than with anything that might constitute a referendum on the game’s popularity. There are several dynamics at work in the sport, where huge wealth still flows to the best of the best, while there is less money left over for the so-called middle class, despite continuing growth in baseball’s revenues.Owners, it seems, have figured out how to keep costs down by using younger players, who are cheaper than veterans, thus freeing up cash for the occasional megadeal. Players like Trout, Harper and Machado benefit, while others are forced to accept less.“In the past, teams were valuing players differently,” said James Paxton, a starting pitcher for the Yankees. “For a long time, that system was fine. Now that the teams have changed the way they’re valuing players, especially older players, it’s kind of broken the system and it is forcing us to take a look at it.”In a study that has not yet been published, J.C. Bradbury, an economics professor at Kennesaw State University, calculated that baseball revenue rose at an average rate of 6.6 percent from 2003 to 2015, while player salaries rose at an average rate of just 4.4 percent.Major League Baseball revenues reached $10.3 billion last year. The sources include evermore money from guaranteed sources, like multibillion-dollar media deals for the entire sport and other lucrative media contracts, many at the local level. Less important have been ticket sales, which generally fluctuate with wins and losses.With the shift in valuation of players, the average salary went down in 2018 for the first time in 14 years (to a little more than $4 million), according to the players association. It was just the fourth time in the last 50 years that the average has gone down.Dan Halem, the deputy commissioner of M.L.B., said there was no evidence of teams not trying to win, and he painted a very different picture of baseball’s economics.Salaries have gone up on average 5.3 percent each year since 2012, keeping pace with baseball’s revenue growth during that time, he said, and while the pay may have been slightly down or flat in 2018, one year does not make a trend. He also said that over the last decade the players had received a consistent percentage of the game’s revenue, from 52 to 57 percent.“In a market-based system, depending upon the year and how our clubs are valuing players,” said Halem, “certain players do better than others.”Yet words like “collusion” and “strike” — once the third rails of the sport, especially after the ruinous strike of 1994-1995 — are now regularly uttered by players and agents — despite the huge contracts.Focusing on giant deals misses the bigger picture, according to Jeff Borris, a longtime baseball agent who has represented stars like Barry Bonds, and is now the general counsel of the Ballengee Group, a sports representation agency.“Contracts like Trout’s and Harper’s are aberrations,” Borris said. “The focus should be more on things like why isn’t Dallas Keuchel signed or the contract that Gio Gonzalez just signed. Those are the areas that are of concern.”Keuchel, a two-time All-Star starting pitcher for the Houston Astros, remained unsigned one week before opening day, while Gonzalez, a solid, durable starting pitcher, has signed a minor-league deal with the Yankees.“I think the owners are manipulating the system to their advantage,” Borris said.For decades, baseball players have been represented by what is widely considered to be the strongest union in all of professional sports. As a result, baseball has no limits on salaries, though its luxury tax, which penalizes a team after its payroll rises above $206 million, can function as a de facto cap.The problem now, at least as articulated by players, is that while teams reward superstars, they no longer feel compelled to spend to win if they do not believe they already have the pieces in place to compete for a championship.“Why is there not an interest in players that can help teams win, particularly as we get to the last two weeks of spring training?” Tony Clark, the executive director of the players association, said before the Trout deal was reached.Despite baseball’s strong union, certain provisions that kept salaries rising for decades turned out to be norms, not hard and fast rules.Baseball players do not become free agents until they accrue six years of service time. They are generally paid at the league minimum for their first three seasons, while in the next three they can receive higher salaries through negotiation or arbitration. This leads to odd situations like Trout’s being voted the American League most valuable player in his third full season while earning just $1 million.This used to be acceptable to players because they made up for it on the back end of their careers. There are the infamous albatross contracts given to veterans, like the $125 million extension signed by Ryan Howard in 2010, but most of the time it was veteran players being paid a fair wage, or being slightly overpaid, well into their 30s, and sometimes 40s.It’s not a coincidence that Trout, Harper and Machado all got their megadeals at the age of 27 or younger. But as the circumstances of older players like Gonzalez and Keuchel demonstrate, teams have been working on the assumption that a veteran’s abilities are likely to decline soon after his salary peaks and that it makes sense to use younger players, who can fill out a roster at lower costs and risks — even if the chance to make the playoffs is also reduced.“I don’t think that we thought that teams all of a sudden were going to just stop competing to the degree that they are now,” said Adam Ottavino, a Yankees pitcher. “A lot of things changed really fast.”"
"International Players Dot Rosters Across NCAA Tournament - The New York Times

"Wait, New York Has a Pro Rugby Team? Yes, and It’s a Winner So Far - The New York Times
James Kennedy wants you to know something about Rugby United New York right away. “We’re not the Knicks,” he said.Though New York City’s new professional rugby union team is an expansion team, he said, it will not wind up at the bottom of the standings like its basketball brother. Kennedy, the team’s owner and chairman, did not hedge when he spoke about the team’s chances in Major League Rugby. “We are certainly playoff bound,” he promised.And why not? The team is 4-1, having played only road games so far in a 16-game season, and is ready for its home opener, against the Toronto Arrows, on Friday night at MCU Park in Coney Island.New sports leagues — Major League Rugby is in its second year — have a habit of failing, and a professional rugby outfit would seem to be particularly perilous in a country where even many die-hard sports fans don’t know a scrum from a line-out.But Kennedy expects a good crowd on Friday and beyond. “I’d say we’ll average 4,500,” he said, adding that their first game in the 7,000-seat stadium was “close to a sellout.” The team could be helped by popular pricing: $20 to $35 a ticket.With confidence, Kennedy added, “We’re looking for a bigger stadium for a playoff game.” The top four finishers in the nine-team league make the playoffs.The television box is checked. Fans not eager to jump on the D or F train can see many of the games on CBS Sports Network, SNY or ESPN+.While rugby newcomers will hardly be turned away, Kennedy believes that a good chunk of the fans who turn up will be fairly savvy to the game. “In the tristate area, there are 283 rugby clubs,” he said. “There are 35,000 players who started in college or high school.” He expects the expatriate community to turn up, too.He described the league’s business model as “a direct copy” of Major League Soccer’s. Kennedy owns his team and also a piece of the league. “If a team or two fails, there’s money to keep it on its feet and then move it after the season,” he said.Finding players for a rugby team in a football country required a multipronged approach. The team held four combines. One discovery was outside center Seimou Smith of New Haven, who started as a football player at Southern Connecticut State before shifting to rugby. The team has also recruited overseas.That recruitment came easily, Kennedy said. “Some big names reached out and wanted to come to New York. That’s the lure of the city, not me.”The team hired Mike Tolkin, a New Yorker who coached the United States national team and at Xavier High School in Manhattan.“This only works if it’s a New York team,” Kennedy said. “We wanted to play within the city limits. If we find a New Yorker with 80 percent of the skills of a European, we’ll take the New Yorker.”Players will make $20,000 to $35,000 for the four-and-a-half-month season. Kennedy said that of the squad of 34, eight or nine were also working full time, many as teachers.One of those is Mike Petri, a scrum half and the team captain. A native Brooklynite who has played in three World Cups for the United States, he teaches science and coaches at Bay Ridge Prep in Brooklyn. “They are very supportive,” he said. “Sometimes I go from coaching baseball or basketball straight to rugby practice.”Petri, 34, retired in 2015, but the lure of a professional league in the United States brought him back. “The quality of play across the board is outstanding,” he said, citing fullback Ben Foden, who has played for top club teams and the England national team.“Compared to the New York A.C.,” a semipro club Petri has played for, “you get a high level of skill and a high rugby I.Q. It’s a faster game.”Like Kennedy, Petri is bullish on the league’s future. “It’s an organic growth,” he said. “We’re going to start with the existing fan base. The rugby community is so tight-knit. The thrill of being part of that group is tangible. And most people who watch their first rugby game are intrigued and get hooked.”And Kennedy has even bigger plans, arising in part from his background in construction. While acknowledging that options in the city are limited (just ask the New York City F.C. of M.L.S.), he said that in the longer term, “I would love to build a stadium a few years from now.”For now, though, it will be all about defeating the likes of the Houston SaberCats and the Glendale Raptors and lifting the Major League Rugby trophy."
"College Sports 101: A U.N.C. Class Reviews a Scandal at Its Source - The New York Times
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.A year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.But critics saw few systemic changes.“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.A history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”"
"Another Football League Is on the Edge of Folding - The New York Times
The Alliance of American Football is planning to suspend operations and will not play games this weekend, according to three people familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.The league isn’t officially folding, the people said Tuesday, at least not yet. An official announcement about its status was expected soon. In a statement, Bill Polian, one of the league’s founders, confirmed the decision and expressed disappointment.The Alliance is the latest in a long line of upstart professional football leagues that tried and failed to capitalize on the seemingly insatiable appetite for the sport in America. Because the N.F.L. draws an average of about 15 million viewers for each game over its five-month season, the start-up owners tend to assume that a new league with just a fraction of that audience will succeed.It hasn’t turned out that way.Since the American Football League merged with the N.F.L. in 1970, there has been the World Football League, the United States Football League, the once and future XFL, the United Football League and others. While they have had varying business models, franchise locations and opinions on the best calendar for football, none of the leagues has yet found the right formula for sustained success.Now it seems the Alliance for American Football will soon follow them to the grave.The league’s chief executive and co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, probably should have known better. He the son of Dick Ebersol, the longtime NBC Sports chairman who started the first iteration of the XFL nearly 20 years ago, alongside the professional wrestling impresario Vince McMahon. That league folded after a single season.With the help of Polian, the former general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Ebersol secured distribution deals for some of the league’s games on CBS, TNT and the NFL Network, a strong sign for a new league. The deals included little cash, however, according to two of the people.“I think there is a blind spot for most people that want to start professional sports leagues,” said Michael Huyghue, who was the commissioner of the United Football League. “The biggest issue is: What is the revenue stream? What is the revenue model?” The U.F.L. began play in 2009 and ceased operations in 2012.Most leagues require substantial television rights payments to survive, as well as a critical mass of ticket sales. Both are difficult to obtain for an unproven league. Knowing how substantial the start-up costs would be, the Alliance tried to justify its operations by comparing itself to a Silicon Valley tech company that expects to lose money for years while creating value. Ebersol believed the league’s technology and readiness for legalized gambling would make it a success.From the beginning, Ebersol had modest expectations for Year One.“There are going to be empty seats for quite some time, but we are committed to long-term investment around the idea,” he said in an interview in February, shortly before the season began.He estimated the Alliance would require $500 million to $750 million during the first five years.“You have to justify that expense, because either you are an eccentric billionaire creating a football league or raising really smart money that is patient,” Ebersol said.The Alliance’s eight teams, clustered in the Southeast and Southwest, began play after the Super Bowl. They have each played eight regular season games, with the championship game scheduled for April 27 in Frisco, Tex.But almost from the beginning, there were signs that things weren’t going well, including reports that the league had almost missed payroll.Last week the league’s controlling owner, Tom Dundon, told USA Today that the league was in danger of folding because it hadn’t secured an agreement with the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association to allow young players from N.F.L. rosters to work in the Alliance.“If the players union is not going to give us young players, we can’t be a development league,” said Dundon, who is also the owner of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes. Just two weeks into the Alliance’s game schedule, he committed up to $250 million and became the controlling owner.But to Huyghue, whose United Football League lasted almost four seasons, that was the wrong focus.“Everyone keeps thinking players, players, players,” he said. “That doesn’t solve your revenue problem.”Polian’s statement blamed Dundon for the decision to suspend the league. “When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all,” Polian said.Dundon could not be reached for comment.Despite the poor track record, the Alliance surely won’t be the last attempt to start a new professional football league. McMahon is reviving the XFL, which is to begin play next year, and last week he sold almost $272 million in World Wrestling Entertainment stock to support the venture, according to a company filing. The Pacific Pro League, founded by Don Yee, Tom Brady’s agent, is also set to start playing next year.The A.A.F.’s decision to shut down has immediate repercussions for at least one of the Alliance’s partners. Saturday afternoon’s game between Memphis and San Antonio was scheduled to be shown on CBS, serving as the lead-in to the two men’s Final Four college basketball games."
"In Texas, the Land of Football, It’s Rugby to the Rescue - The New York Times
ARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”"
"Plans to Reform European Football Run Into Opposition - The New York Times
LISBON — Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent's leagues declared they were 'united' in their determination to protect domestic football.The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would ""vigorously defend"" it against any plans to impose a new calendar. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region's biggest clubs, to ""design the club competitions of the future.""The ECA, in turn, said it wanted more teams playing more matches in continental competitions. European Leagues, which says it represents 900-plus clubs through its affiliates including ""those who are not normally playing European football"", said domestic football should remain the priority.""Our main objective is to safeguard the domestic competitions and protect the domestic competitions if needed,"" its president Lars-Christer Olsson told a news conference.""These are the most important to the fans, they are much more important than any international competitions.""Olsson added: ""These are interesting times. When it comes to real issues, I am happy to see all leagues are united.""Although UEFA has only just started discussing its plans, Olsson said it was important that the public knew what was happening. ""We have to make the views of the European Leagues known to everyone, not only stakeholders but also fans and the public so everyone knows what is going on and how we are preparing for the future club competitions,"" he said.Olsson added that the last 10 years had been negative for domestic leagues as revenue from UEFA competition had increased the gap between the richest clubs and the rest.The Premier League said that in a statement that it had ""significant concerns"" over reported plans to change the format and qualifying criteria for European tournaments.""All clubs unanimously agreed it is inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures, calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game and will work together to protect the Premier League,"" it said.""We have a fantastic combination of competitive football and committed fans that we will vigorously defend,"" it continued, adding that allegiances and local rivalries were often passed down through generations.The Premier League said it would ensure that ""European football bodies understand the importance of this, and their obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football.""

"Opinion | Do More for Football Players With Head Trauma - The New York Times
To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"Johnny Manziel Barred From Canadian Football League - The New York Times
Quarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)"

"Sheikh Salman Retains Place at Helm of Asian Football - The New York Times
KUALA LUMPUR — Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa was re-elected unopposed to the position as president of the Asian Football Confederation on Saturday after the regional body's congress confirmed a new four-year term for the Bahraini by acclamation.The 53-year-old, who was not present at the meeting due to the death of his mother earlier in the week, was handed a third term at the helm after his rivals, Mohammed Al Romaithi from the United Arab Emirates and Qatari Saoud Al Mohannadi, withdrew.Sheikh Salman will extend his reign as president until at least 2023, by which time he will have completed a 10-year spell in charge of the 47-member body after initially completing the truncated term of former president Mohammed bin Hammam.He took over for the last two years of Bin Hammam's stint as AFC president after the Qatari was banned for life by governing body FIFA from all football activities for his involvement in a corruption scandal.A member of the Bahrian royal family, Sheikh Salman first came to prominence in footballing circles in 2009 when he faced off against Bin Hammam for a seat on FIFA's decision making body, a ballot he lost by a single vote.However, he won the presidential election in 2013 and was returned unopposed in 2015 before running unsuccessfully against Gianni Infantino for the position of FIFA president the following year.Initially elected on a platform of accountability, he has becoming increasingly distant during his presidency, rarely taking questions from the media since winning his second term of office.The former Bahrain Football Association president has denied accusations he was involved in human rights abuses by the Gulf state's ruling family during a crackdown on democracy protesters in 2011.The issue resurfaced in January when Sheikh Salman's position in world football was questioned by campaigners seeking the release of former Bahrain international Hakeem Al Araibi from a Thai detention centre under threat of extradition to the Gulf state.Sheikh Salman did not comment publicly on the matter and the AFC later claimed to have recused him 18 months earlier from involvement in matters involving nations in the west of the continent due to a potential conflict of interests.Those matters, though, have done little to dampen enthusiasm for him to remain in charge of Asia's governing body, with his hopes of reelection boosted in June last year when he signed off on a new deal for the AFC's commercial and broadcast rights.The agreement with Chinese-backed company DDMC Fortis will ensure revenues more than double from those under the current agreement with long-term partner Lagardere Sports.

"Alliance of American Football Ends First Season Prematurely - The New York Times
SAN DIEGO — The Alliance of American Football has ended its first season prematurely and told most employees that they will be terminated as of Wednesday.Employees were notified of the decision in a letter from the AAF board on Tuesday afternoon. The board essentially is majority owner Tom Dundon, who also owns the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes.The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, gave no reason for ending the inaugural season, only that the decision was made ""after careful consideration."" It also said a small staff would remain to seek new investment capital and ""restructure our business. Should those efforts prove successful, we look forward to working with many of you on season two.""The abrupt end to the latest spring league after just eight weeks stunned co-founder Bill Polian, the former NFL executive who built a Super Bowl winner with Indianapolis.""I'm extremely disappointed,"" Polian told The Associated Press by phone from Charlotte, North Carolina.""On the one hand it was kind of our wildest fantasies come true. It all came true and now it's all come crashing down.""Asked why the league was shutting down, Polian said he's heard ""only that it's about the money. That's all.""The league had teams in Orlando, Atlanta, San Diego, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, Birmingham and Memphis.Several hours before the letter was sent, Memphis quarterback Johnny Manziel tweeted : ""If you're an AAF player and the league does dissolve. The last check you got will be the last one that you get. No lawsuit or anything else will get you your bread. Save your money and keep your head up. It's the only choice at this point unless something drastic happens.""Manziel said in another tweet: ""Just the reality of this unfortunate situation.. great concept, good football on the field and fun for fans to watch. Just not enough money to go around which has been the main problem with ""other"" leagues for a long time.""The letter said employees would be paid through Wednesday.The AAF seemed to have a better chance of surviving than other alternative leagues, such as the USFL and the World League, because of the people and philosophies involved.Polian and co-founder Charlie Ebersol, a television and film producer, envisioned it as a development league for the NFL with several rules tweaks designed to speed up play and make it safer. There were no kickoffs or PATs. Teams had to go for a two-point conversion after touchdowns.""We were headed to a tremendous run of success, beginning with Saturday's game leading into the Final Four on CBS,"" Polian told the AP. ""Our league on the field has prospered and grown. The football's gotten better, and that's a tremendous tribute to the coaches and players and GMs and front office staff and all the other people who have done a phenomenal job.""Polian later said in a statement that when Dundon took over, it was his and Ebersol's belief ""that we would finish the season, pay our creditors and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all. The momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity.""While it clearly wasn't NFL-caliber football, it was entertaining and helped fill the post-Super Bowl void. Among the league's coaches were Steve Spurrier, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz and Mike Riley.However, there were signs of trouble in a league put together in less than one year.Dundon invested $250 million in the AAF shortly after play began. At the time, Ebersol said reports the Alliance was short on cash and needed a bailout from Dundon in order to make payroll were untrue. He said the league had a technical glitch in its payroll system that was fixed.The AAF aspired to be a league for players with NFL hopes, but it could not reach agreement with the NFLPA to use players at the end of NFL rosters.___AP College Football Writer Ralph D.

"Guardiola Tells England's Rose Not to Walk Away From Football - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game. ""The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer,"" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.""I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday.""The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.

"Brazilian Women Unable to Emulate U.S. Footballers in Equality Battle - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Brazil's female footballers have made great strides in growing their domestic game but they lack the organisation to emulate the United States team and demand the same pay and conditions as men, defender Erika told Reuters on Tuesday.The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) this year obliged all first division clubs to create a women's side and are funding them directly, officials said.But their income is still vastly inferior to their male counterparts and Erika said she is envious of the World Cup-winning U.S. squad, 28 of whom sued the U.S. Soccer Federation last month in a lawsuit that includes complaints about wages and working conditions.""I think it is sensational what the U.S. players did,"" she said in a phone interview from Spain, the day after Brazil lost 1-0 to Scotland in a friendly, their ninth consecutive defeat.""We have the strength to do the same in Brazil but we don't have courage or the (people) to guide us.""The U.S. women are a gigantic force. They have won a lot and that makes it easier for them to fight for what they want. We need to be united but we haven't managed that.""Erika blamed that lack of unity on geography. Most of the Brazilian women play their club football outside the country and get together only for international games, which makes organising more difficult.""I think distance is a problem,"" the 31-year-old Corinthians defender said. ""The principal players are based outside the country and that makes it more complicated, if they were all able to be here it would make it easier to develop, and we'd be stronger. ""Sadly, we still think individually.""The Brazilian players nevertheless looked at recent big crowds for women's matches in Spain and Italy – a world record 60,739 people turned out to see Atletico Madrid take on Barcelona last month - as indicative of the growing power of the female game.Women's football has gained a higher profile this year in Brazil, with the CBF paying to help women's teams compete in the 16-team first division and also setting up a second division and under-18 league. ""Without a doubt here has been a huge growth and there is a long way to go,"" Erika said. ""I want to see the kind of crowds we saw in Madrid in Brazil. It inspires us.""Brazil are one of 24 teams who will take part in the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7. (Reporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Christian Radnedge)"

Jalen Hurts has gone from winning a national championship at Alabama to following in the footsteps of back-to-back Heisman winners Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray at Oklahoma.His message as he met the media Wednesday for the first time since his transfer: He's ready for all the pressure and expectations.""I think this whole situation is unique. Everything about it is unique,"" Hurts said at a news conference in Norman, Okla., that lasted slightly longer than 30 minutes. ""For me, I know it's happening to a unique person. I'm not your average Joe. I'm kind of built for these type of situations.""Hurts threw for 5,626 yards with 48 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in three seasons at Alabama, adding 1,976 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns. After losing a 2018 camp battle to sophomore Tua Tagovailoa, Hurts stuck around and cemented his place in Alabama lore when he came off the bench to lead a Crimson Tide comeback against Georgia in the SEC title game.--Save the dates: Clemson and Oklahoma have scheduled a home-and-home football series. But there will be a significant wait.The schools announced that the teams will meet Sept. 15, 2035, in Clemson, S.C., and then again on Sept. 13, 2036, in Norman.Given each team's recent success, it's quite possible the programs will meet outside of the regular season before then.

"Massachusetts Bill Would Ban Tackle Football Until After Seventh Grade - The New York Times
Less than a month after the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislature’s Joint Committee on Public Health this week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.The bipartisan bill, known as No Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.“There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development,” one of the bill’s sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure and public opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.“Should we ban youth soccer too?” asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. “Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldn’t be?”A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, which governs youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are “best left to parents.” To that end, she said, it has created a set of guidelines developed by leaders in athlete development and football.The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. “Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids,” he said.Studies by Boston University and other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer who teaches a legal course on traumatic brain injury and tracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth league’s promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies’ offering low-nicotine cigarettes.“People don’t understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks,” he said. “It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.”Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of the Massachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.“Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground,” he said, “it seems like an overstep of authority.”Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coaches youth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.“I understand the concern,” he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the “knuckle-dragging days” when “you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking” during practice.He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introduced shoulder-tackling techniques developed by U.S.A. Football.Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots’ head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not “a political guy.”“But,” he said, “I’ll definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.”In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, which increasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association adopted new guidelines intended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues were quashed by grass-roots movements led by parents and coaches.When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jersey proposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.That bill is currently in limbo.“Unfortunately, the old boys’ club of politics and football go hand in hand,” said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. “This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.”A similar bill in New York failed, and California’s Safe Football Act was pulled before a committee vote. The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,  did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Maryland’s proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer, was killed in committee.These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.“I really did not expect it to pass,” said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Maryland’s bill.“But I think it’s a conversation we have to have,” she said, “and I don’t think the conversation is over.”Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.“Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem,” he said. “If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.”"

"On Football: Goodell, With Payton's Help, Gets It Right - The New York Times
PHOENIX — Roger Goodell got it right.NFL fans rarely feel that way. Right now, they should.Many times, perhaps most of the time, the NFL commissioner is doing the bidding of the owners. That's led to plenty of criticism of Goodell when it's the guys who run the 32 franchises who deserve more bad reviews than he does.When it comes to league probes, the NFL so often has fallen short — Ray Rice, Kareem Hunt, Saints bounties — that Goodell takes the arrows rather than the investigators who should be blamed.And yes, there are instances, particularly when it comes to handing out discipline, in which Goodell is the correct target.So when the guy uses his power for the good of the game, for the players, the coaches and, indeed, the fans, then praise is due.Two months after one of the most embarrassing moments of his regime — or that of any other commissioner — Goodell pretty much made sure a deeply necessary change to the rules was passed.Don't underestimate the significance of the addition of pass interference, whether flagged or not, to the video review officiating system. Such calls and non-calls now can be challenged by coaches and reviewed by officials. It was passed for one season, by the astounding margin of 31-1. It almost certainly is here to stay, and Goodell is a major reason.""I told the owners we need to get to a place, and I felt strongly we should have OPI and DPI and that we should be able to throw flags (that were not thrown on the field),"" Goodell said Tuesday. ""Everyone in there finally got to understand through a long process and a lot of discussion, everyone wanted to get it right. Some had to remove themselves from long-shared views.""A short-shared view among fans, especially those in the Big Easy, has been that an egregious missed call in the NFC championship game cost the New Orleans Saints a trip to the Super Bowl. Their case was strengthened by this decision.Yet, in a way, this is a more important victory for the Who Dats and for all pro football fans. The sport has become so fast, so complex and so wide open that the officials struggle to keep up.Even worse, technology is so advanced that the errors made in real time become exacerbated when examined in the close-up, super-slow motion shots available to viewers.The NFL needed a leap forward like this. Indeed, it's more like a long Drew Brees to Michael Thomas touchdown pass than an Alvin Kamara run for a first down. Both plays move the ball, but the TD throw can be an instant game changer.Credit Goodell for laying down the law to get the video review rules enhanced. Also credit Saints coach Sean Payton, who helped lead the charge to progress not only because he was the victimized guy with the head set on the sideline for the blown call, but for catalyzing the movement.""There were just a lot of great healthy discussions about our game,"" said Payton, along with Pittsburgh's Mike Tomlin the only coaches on the powerful competition committee that recommends rule adjustments. ""When you are on this committee there is a little bit of a responsibility just to the game and football fans in general.""Anytime, I think, if we have gone through a process like this and with an open heart tried to look at doing what is right, and after much discussion came to a conclusion where ownership, league office, coaches, general managers felt real good about, certainly fans won, knowing that, man, those guys are working hard at the right decision.""___"
"Wood Elected as First Female President of New Zealand Football - The New York Times
WELLINGTON — New Zealand Football continued overhauling its governance after a tumultuous 2018 by electing Johanna Wood as its first female president at their annual congress in Auckland on Tuesday.Wood, who was elected to NZF's executive committee last year for a four-year term, replaces acting president Phil Barry, who resigned last week.Barry himself replaced Deryck Shaw, who resigned in October after an independent review found the executive committee had adopted a 'hands off approach' to governance following complaints by the women's national team about their coach.""We have gone through and are continuing to go through a period of transition,"" Wood said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Both ExCo and the senior management team... are committed to delivering on the recommendations of the independent review.""Wood was serving as an acting vice president until Tuesday's election and was last month elected as the Oceania confederation's member to the FIFA Council, which sets the world governing body's strategic direction.NZF was engulfed in controversy last year with the Football Ferns' women's team complaining about the environment created by coach Andreas Heraf, who eventually resigned. He was also NZF's national technical director.Chief executive Andy Martin also left the organisation and was yet to be replaced. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"

"England's Rose Can't Wait to See Back of Football After Abuse - The New York Times
LONDON — England defender Danny Rose has had enough of racism in the game and said he cannot wait to get out of football amid frustration over the response of the authorities to the abuse.Tottenham Hotspur full back Rose was among the players who were victims of offensive chanting when they played for England in Montenegro last month in a Euro 2020 qualifier.“I’ve had enough,” Rose, 28, was quoted as saying by The Guardian on Thursday. “At the minute, how I programme myself is that I just think: ‘I’ve got five or six more years left in football and I just can’t wait to see the back of it’.“Seeing how things are done in the game at the minute, I just want to get out of it.""Rose feels not enough action is being taken and the disparity in the punishment highlights its ineffectiveness.“Obviously, it is a bit sad (to feel like this) but when countries only get fined what I’d probably spend on a night out in London, what do you expect?” he added.“You see my manager get banned for two games for just being confrontational against Mike Dean,” he said of Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino’s two-match touchline ban for confronting the referee at the end of a 2-1 defeat at Burnley in February.“But yet a country can only get fined a little bit of money for being racist. It’s just a bit of a farce at the minute. So that’s where we are at in football and until there’s a harsh punishment, there’s not much else we can expect.""Rose said he had expected the racist abuse dished out to him and his England team mates Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi during the match against Montenegro in Podgorica.“I played in Serbia about eight years ago and it happened there. So I sort of thought it would be a possibility that it might happen again and it did. “I looked up straight away in the first half and I know the exact time it happened in the first half.“But it didn’t affect my game. I’m a big boy now and I know that three points are obviously not the most important thing when you’re going through something like that, but I just wanted the team to get three points so that we could move on and get out of Montenegro as quickly as possible,” Rose said.England are top of 2020 European Championship qualifying Group A with a maximum six points after their 5-1 win in Montenegro and a 5-0 home victory over the Czech Republic.

Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.“I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy,” said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the school’s Alzheimer’s Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is “good evidence” to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football — and not just those involving concussions — and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.“I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head,” Mez said. “But given the country’s interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.”Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularly  in New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states — Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma — lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.“We’re not doing this as a recruiting ploy,” he said. “It’s just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they won’t have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.”Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coaches seminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.Terry O’Neil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, “is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.”"
"Ahead of Super Bowl, Trump Raises Doubts on Tackle Football for His Son - The New York Times
ATLANTA — Hours before the sport’s biggest game, President Trump joined the growing ranks of parents anxious over tackle football, saying in an interview he “would have a hard time” letting his 12-year-old son play.“I mean, it’s a dangerous sport and I think it’s, I, it’s really tough” if his son wanted to take up the game, Mr. Trump said in an interview with CBS ahead of its Sunday evening broadcast of the Super Bowl.The president’s concerns are at odds with his previous criticism that the N.F.L. has been making the game too soft to avoid concussions and other injuries, and suggest that he is struggling with many of the same questions that parents across the country are asking about the safety of youth tackle football.Mr. Trump said he would ultimately let his youngest son, Barron, who plays soccer, decide if he wanted to play tackle football and would not steer him away from the sport.[Super Bowl 2019: Game time, live updates and scores.]But the president said he had seen reports about the dangers of playing tackle football, and heard that some N.F.L. players were not letting their sons play tackle football.His comments added another wrinkle to his ambivalent relationship with the game he often celebrates, but also laments. His doubts about the safety of the game come five years after President Barack Obama said that if he had a son, he would not let him play professional football.Some studies have suggested that playing tackle football before age 12 puts athletes at a higher risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, but the issue has not been widely studied. In general, there has been growing awareness of C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease many former players have developed from repeated hits to the head.As a result of such concerns, participation in flag football has exploded.Yet while Mr. Obama held a forum at the White House on the dangers of concussions, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said the N.F.L. is being overprotective.In September 2017, for instance, Mr. Trump complained that the N.F.L. was ruining the game because the referees were trying to control unnecessarily rough tackles.“Today if you hit too hard — 15 yards! Throw him out of the game!” he said, adding: “They’re ruining the game! They’re ruining the game. That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game.”At a campaign rally in 2016, Mr. Trump referred to a woman in the audience who fainted, but returned to the crowd.“The woman was out cold and now she’s coming back,” he said. “See? We don’t go by these new, and very much softer, N.F.L. rules. Concussion. Oh, oh! Got a little ding on the head. No, no, you can’t play for the rest of the season. Our people are tough.”Trump also called the N.F.L. “soft” for penalizing helmet-to-helmet hits.In the CBS interview, however, he sounded more cautionary notes.“I hate to say it, because I love to watch football,” Mr. Trump said. “I think the N.F.L. is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son — well, I’ve heard N.F.L. players saying they wouldn’t let their sons play football. So, it’s not totally unique, but I, I would have a hard time with it.”"
"Ex-Football Star Pens Memoir About Wrongful Rape Conviction - The New York Times
NEW YORK — Brian Banks, whose story of being wrongfully accused of rape will be a feature film in August, has a memoir coming out the month before.Atria Books announced Tuesday that Banks' ""What Set Me Free"" will be published July 2. Banks said in a statement that he wants to call attention to ""a flawed judicial system."" The film ""Brian Banks"" stars Aldis Hodge and Greg Kinnear and comes out Aug. 9.Banks, a high school football star at the time he was accused, served more than five years in prison after agreeing to a plea deal on rape and kidnapping charges. He was released in 2007, but had to register as a sex offender. His accuser later recanted her claim and Banks was exonerated in 2012."
"Grab and Go: How Sticky Gloves Have Changed Football - The New York Times
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did."
"Johnny (Lam) Jones, Texas Track and Football Star, Dies at 60 - The New York Times
Johnny (Lam) Jones, a former Olympic gold medal sprinter and swift-footed football star at the University of Texas who never lived up to his promise as a football professional with the Jets, died on Friday. He was 60.His death was announced by the university, which said it came “after a lengthy battle with cancer.” Texas news organizations said he died in a hospital in Round Rock, Tex., north of Austin.Jones learned that he had multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, in 2005. Because he did not have health insurance, former Texas teammates raised money for his medical costs.Jones was phenomenon at his central Texas high school, in the city of Lampasas, running world-class times of 9.21 seconds for 100 yards and 10.14 for 100 meters.After graduating, he competed that summer in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, finishing sixth in the 100 meters and winning a gold medal running the second leg of the United States 4x100-meter relay team.He then enrolled at Texas, where his speed landed him on both the track and football teams. He would go on to become a record-setting All-American sprinter for the university.In his freshman year he ran in the same backfield as another Johnny Jones. To distinguish the two, Coach Darrell Royal gave one the nickname Lam, for Jones’s hometown, and the other the nickname Ham, because that Jones came from Hamlin, Tex.Lam Jones, at 5 feet 11 and 190 pounds, was a wide receiver in his last three years as a Longhorn, 1977-79, and an All-American in his senior year. He scored eight touchdowns of 45 yards or more at Texas and was chosen the team’s most valuable player in 1978.In the 1980 National Football League draft, the Jets traded two first-round picks to be able to move up and make Jones their first pick (and the draft’s second choice overall). He signed for $2.1 million over six years (the equivalent of $6.8 million today); it was pro football’s first million-dollar contract.But his pro career was an injury-ridden disappointment. In his first season in New York, he caught 25 passes but dropped 18. In his second season, his main job was to run in plays from the Jets’ offensive coordinator, Joe Walton, to the quarterback, Richard Todd. The New York Times sports columnist Dave Anderson called him “the Jets’ millionaire messenger.”There were a few highlights for Jones that season, however, including catching a 47-yard touchdown pass from Todd in a playoff-clinching 28-3 victory over the Green Bay Packers at Shea Stadium in New York. (The Jets, in the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, went on to lose to the Buffalo Bills in a wild-card game the next week.)In five seasons (1980-84) with the Jets, Jones suffered a broken collarbone, a pulled hamstring and a torn finger tendon. He spent 1985 and 1986 on the Jets’ injured reserve list. The next year, the Jets traded him to the San Francisco 49ers.“I know how they remember me in New York: I’m the guy they blew the draft pick on,” Jones told The Daily News in 2005. “That’s O.K. I didn’t live up to their expectations, but I didn’t live up to my own expectations, either.”He did worse in San Francisco: The 49ers promptly waived him in training camp. He then joined the Dallas Cowboys, who dropped him after he missed a morning meeting because, the team said, he had been drinking and had overslept.Indeed, he told The News that he had struggled with alcohol and cocaine addictions both during his playing days and afterward.As a pro, Jones caught 138 passes for 2,322 yards and 13 touchdowns. His best season was in 1983, with 43 catches, 734 yards and four touchdowns.“Games and challenges never scared Johnny,” Bill Little, an assistant athletic director at Texas, recalled on a Texas football website in 2004. “People did. Folks thought he was just extremely shy and sometimes rude. Years later, they would diagnose the condition he had as social anxiety disorder.”In 1988, his playing days over and living again in Texas, Jones served a month in jail after pleading guilty to indecency with a child, a 12-year-old girl. The episode was a turning point, he later said, compelling him to seek treatment for his addictions.“I needed to get my personal life in order,” he was quoted as saying. “I came back to live in the real world.”He sold cars and running tracks, made motivational speeches to high school athletes and was active with the Texas Special Olympics.In 1979, Jones donated his Olympic gold medal to the Special Olympics. Years later, he explained why: “I’d never seen anyone stop in a race and help someone who had fallen get up.”John Wesley Jones II was born on April 4, 1958, in Lawton, Okla., to John W. Jones and Mary Jones Dillon. His father was an Army sergeant who was later transferred to Texas.Lam Jones was married and divorced three times. There was no immediate information available about survivors.Jones was philosophical about the up-and-down course his life had taken. He was quoted by Bill Little on the Texas website: “I got to run in the Olympics, got a great education and played for the University of Texas and played for the New York Jets.”“I learned a lot,” he added, “and I had some tough lessons.”"
"When Is a Hacker a Whistle-Blower? In Football Leaks Case, a Hungarian Judge Will Decide - The New York Times
Over the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”"
"Ex-Utah State Football Player Sentenced for Sexual Assaults - The New York Times
BRIGHAM CITY, Utah — A former Utah State University football player convicted of sexually assaulting six women was sentenced Wednesday to 26 years to life in prison during a hearing in which the judge called his actions ""horrendous"" and told his victims he believed them.Torrey Green, 25, was accused by six women of being sexually assaulted while on dates with him between 2013-2015, and jurors convicted him in January of crimes that included raping five women and sexual battery of a sixth.Utah district judge Brian Cannell said during the sentencing in the northern Utah city of Brigham City that he was disappointed that Green never showed remorse, The Salt Lake Tribune reported .""What you did was horrendous,"" Cannell said. ""In the eyes of the law, you are a serial rapist. They didn't want it. They didn't like it.""Green again denied the allegations during the sentencing, echoing the claim he made during the trial that the sexual encounters either were consensual or didn't happen. Green cried while saying he wasn't a ""monster"" as he was portrayed.""I am horrified at the way these women describe my encounters with each of them,"" Green said. ""I don't know why these six believe that I am capable of raping them. This was all consensual. And I am so very sorry that they didn't feel the same.""Green, of Rubidoux, California, signed as a rookie lineman for the Atlanta Falcons in 2016 after his college career ended, but the NFL team dropped him that same year after the allegations surfaced.Most of the sentences imposed Wednesday by for Torrey Green will run consecutively, with some to run concurrently.Skye Lazaro, Green's attorney, asked the judge to give Green five years to life, but prosecutor Spencer Walsh countered that Green should serve time for each crime, or it would be a ""terrible message"" to the victims.""The defendant sexually assaulted six women,"" Walsh said. ""Six separate and unique individuals. Six human beings. Six lives that were traumatized and forever changed.""Before he handed down his sentence, Judge Cannell looked at the six victims seated in the courtroom and said, ""I believe you."""
"Relocated From a Park to a Football Stadium, the Miami Open Emphasizes Luxury - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans.Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross’s Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket.“Larry’s done a great job,” Ross said. “He set the bar high, and it’s all great for tennis. But for us, it’s more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way.”Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go.Rather than see the tournament — and its hundreds of millions in local revenue — uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue.The move wasn’t well received by everyone.“Key Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can’t beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,” said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. “We had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me.”At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts — all permanent — were built on top of parking lots.On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon’s Henman Hill, minus the grass.The change recalls the United States Open’s move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.“This place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,” said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins’ chief executive. “We are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L.”Tournament organizers did not take the word “luxury” lightly. The stadium court — painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue — seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court.Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million.Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis.“There’s a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,” said James Blake, the tournament director.Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls.“I had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,” said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan’s Hudson Yards project. “It’s all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they’re watching for those details.”The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men’s and women’s singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages.But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians.“What we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,” said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG’s parent company. “Key Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we’ve got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we’re the new U.S. Open.”"
"Learning With: ‘Grab and Go: How Sticky Gloves Have Changed Football’ - The New York Times
 Before reading the article: With the Super Bowl approaching, it’s a good time to appreciate the athletic prowess of N.F.L. athletes.Watch the three videos of one-handed catches featured in the article.Which catch do you think was the best or most impressive, and why?Now, read the article, “Grab and Go: How Sticky Gloves Have Changed Football,” and answer the following questions: 1. The article begins, “One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.” Why did David Waldstein, the author, choose a play from 40 years ago to open the piece? Why does he suggest that Smith’s fortune might have been different if he were playing football today?2. Mr. Waldstein writes: “When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex.” In your own words, explain the science involved when a player catches a ball while wearing silicone gloves.3. What properties of the silicone glove are most surprising or interesting to you? How does Mr. Waldstein help the reader visualize how the gloves work on a microscopic level?4. How did Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., test the gloves to determine how much “tackiness” they provide for users? How much stickier is the glove than a human hand?5. Jeff Beraznik first had the idea of a sticky football glove as a football player at the University of Ottawa. How did his pursuit of the perfect glove lead him to Karachi, Pakistan? What does his story tell you about the nature of innovation?6. Why was Stickum, an earlier product used by wide receivers, outlawed by the N.F.L.? How do silicone gloves meet the criteria of the current rule book?7. Odell Beckham Jr. is widely seen as the master of the one-handed catch. How has he influenced other receivers playing the game? How has the one-handed catch changed football?Finally, tell us more about what you think: — What’s your reaction to the article? Are you more or less impressed by the athletic prowess of N.F.L. wide receivers?— According to the article:Do you think athletes should be able to use technology to improve their performance? Or do you think they give some athletes an unfair advantage? Does advanced equipment diminish or strengthen individuals’ talent and the sport over all? Why do you think so?— If you do think technology is acceptable in sports, should there be limits on the amount or type of equipment that athletes can use? Is there any advancement that could be considered “going too far” or cheating? Is it all fair game? Why?"
"Tarik Cohen Makes Football Fun Again in Chicago - The New York Times
LAKE FOREST, Ill. — During practice last Thursday afternoon, Tarik Cohen caught a punt. Still clutching the ball, he proceeded to catch another. And another. And another. And another. And another.And another.By the end of this wacky experiment, Cohen was cradling seven balls — one, roughly, for every role he has with the Chicago Bears.Cohen is — O.K., deep breath — the Bears’ handoff-taking, punt-returning, ball-catching, pass-throwing, mismatch-creating, gasp-inducing, highlight-monopolizing cyborg. A year after becoming the first rookie since Gale Sayers, a former Bear, in 1965, to contribute touchdowns by running, receiving, passing and punt return, Cohen has further obliterated concerns that a 5-foot-6 running back from the humble Football Championship Subdivision would struggle transitioning to the N.F.L.’s rugged N.F.C. North.[Wild-Card Weekend: Our Predictions for the N.F.L. Playoffs]If the quarterback-wrecking edge rusher Khalil Mack embodies a defense that has fueled the Bears’ worst-to-first ascent — as the N.F.C.’s third seed, they’ll face the No. 6-seeded Eagles in the wild-card round on Sunday, their first playoff appearance since 2010 — Cohen personifies the offense installed by the team’s first-year coach, Matt Nagy: creative, unpredictable and, at times, downright fun. Nagy has maximized Cohen’s speed, suddenness and receiving skills by aligning him around the formation, from the backfield to the inside to the outside, turning him into, in effect, Chicago’s offensive version of Mack: the player opponents must stalk wherever he is on the field. He led the team in catches (71), yards from scrimmage (1,169) and all-purpose yardage (1,599), and was voted onto the All-Pro team as punt returner.“He’s got a lot of strengths and not a lot of weaknesses,” Nagy said. “Having him be a part of what we do and what we scheme is a huge advantage.”Soon after the Bears hired Nagy away from Kansas City, where he served for five seasons on Andy Reid’s staff, Cohen heard that last season the Chiefs featured three players who gained more than 1,000 yards: receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce and running back Kareem Hunt. Cohen did not know when or how he would get the ball in Chicago, he said, only that he would.“Get me the ball and get me in space,” Cohen said.That just might be his motto. His 170 touches rank second on the team, behind Jordan Howard, the primary rusher. As a runner, Cohen has the seventh-best breakaway percentage in the N.F.L., gaining 44.4 percent of his 444 yards on carries of at least 15 yards, according to Pro Football Focus. As a receiver, Cohen averages 10.2 yards per reception, most among the 20 backs with at least 40 catches, according to Pro Football Reference.As the position has evolved, a hybridized strain of running back has permeated the league, players as comfortable with, and capable of, lining up in the slot or being split wide as they are rushing 20 times per game. Cohen does not run as often as other versatile second-year dynamos like the Panthers’ Christian McCaffrey or the Saints’ Alvin Kamara, but his proficiency in the passing game — his 175 snaps away from the backfield were the most among running backs — has made him, according to Pro Football Focus’s Wins Above Replacement metric, the second-most valuable player at his position, just behind McCaffrey.“I don’t think there’s anything he can’t do,” Bears running back Benny Cunningham said.The Bears’ vast playbook — Minnesota Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer quipped earlier this season that it contained 800 plays — demands Cohen know entire passing concepts because any week he could line up at four or five different spots. His first-year position coach, Charles London, marveled early on at Cohen’s savvy — how he can see a drawing or a video of a play and master his responsibilities on the field in a repetition or two. His improvement as a blocker has helped Chicago disguise its calls, diminishing tendencies that his alignment might have tipped off.“There’s not really a route — at running back or receiver — that he can’t run in this offense,” London said.That was Cohen’s objective during the off-season, he said, when he devoted two days a week to refining routes that come back to the ball, like curls, during seven-on-seven drills with his former North Carolina A&T teammates. He did not want to be branded as only a deep-ball threat, just as he does not want to be perceived as strictly a perimeter runner, someone unwilling — or worse, not stout enough — to run between the tackles.Further evidence: Ask Cohen his top play from this season, and he mentions not the 70-yard screen against the Jets, the 50-yard catch-and-dash at Miami or the overtime-forcing touchdown toss at the Giants. In his mind, all the feints, cutbacks and bursts that evoke his favorite player, Reggie Bush, do not compare to the punt he fielded midway through the first quarter against New England in Week 7, when he stepped left, cut right, then zipped left again, shedding a tackle at his feet before encountering a defender by the boundary squaring up to level him.The contact was brief. The defender crumpled. Cohen did not.“Somebody so small running somebody big over — it makes everybody’s day,” Cohen said.Cohen is short but, listed at 181 pounds, not small. He is thick and sturdy, with disproportionately enormous hands — size 10⅛ from thumb to pinkie, bigger than those of hulking receiving threats like Kelce, Julio Jones and A.J. Green — that help him do things like, say, hold on to seven balls at the same time.Growing up in rural Bunn, N.C., about 30 miles northeast of Raleigh, Cohen specialized in such exploits. For one, he developed his speed — like another Bears playmaker before him — through unorthodox methods. Instead of running through tall, thick grass, as Devin Hester did, Cohen dodged the pit bulls that he said roamed his neighborhood.“It’s fight or flight,” Cohen said. “Either get going or you’re going to get eat, so you’ve got to get out of there.”He did get out of there — to play football, but barely. Had North Carolina A&T, a historically black university, not offered him a scholarship, Cohen would have joined the Navy.Why?“I knew how to swim,” said Cohen, sitting in the Halas Hall lobby before practice one day last week. “And it wasn’t like people were getting killed in the Navy.”Rather than enlist, Cohen opted to dominate the F.C.S. Across his four seasons at A&T, he rushed for a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 5,619 yards, the 10th-most in the history of what was formerly Division I-AA. But when N.F.L. scouts passed through Greensboro, said Shawn Gibbs, his position coach at A&T, some seemed unconvinced.“They just tried to poke holes in everything he did — like, he’s good, but,” Gibbs said. “The guys that were like: ‘Man, this guy can walk under this table. I can’t take him to my G.M.’ Those were the guys that were frustrating.”It was the Bears’ good fortune that their scout who prowls the Southeast, Sam Summerville, attended a historically black college himself. Before even studying Cohen, Summerville admired him as a fan, watching from afar as he rushed for 295 yards — and touchdowns of 74, 83 and 73 yards — against Alcorn State in the Celebration Bowl.The deeper he probed, the more Summerville believed in Cohen. Not as a gadget player, but as an N.F.L. running back. At Summerville’s urging, the Bears deployed additional scouts to evaluate him, and they, too, grew enamored. Still, as they prepped for the 2017 draft, Summerville expected pushback — for everything from Cohen’s statistics, perceived to be inflated by the lesser competition, to his stature. So he relied on emotion as much as reason to convey why they needed him.In an impassioned plea, Summerville showed his colleagues the clip of Cohen catching two balls while doing a back flip. (Yes, really.) He affirmed that rival coaches feared no player more than Cohen. He explained that of the 350 to 400 players he assessed in the fall of 2016, Cohen was “definitely” his favorite.“It got to the point where some of the other scouts may have been rolling their eyes a little bit, like, ‘this guy’s serious,’” Summerville said. “Every time I opened my mouth about him, or every time a question was asked, they were like, ‘Do you think this guy can do this?’ Tarik can do pretty much everything you ask him to.”The Bears chose Cohen with one of their fourth-round selections — they took another foundational player, safety Eddie Jackson, seven picks earlier — and before he even took a snap, Cunningham exhorted his friends to draft him for their fantasy football teams. Many satisfied customers, he said.Over the summer, Summerville reviewed his reports on Cohen, to check whether reality matched projections. It did not. Cohen surpassed them. One after another after another after another.And another."
"I Quit Watching Football Because It Harms Players. Can I Still Keep Up With My Team? - The New York Times
I have decided to stop watching football given the recent findings about the frequency with which concussions occur and the long-term effects of those concussions on the players. I am not trying to take a stand and change any of my family’s or friends’ opinions, but I do want to feel like I’m doing my part. Can I still follow my team in some way, though? I’m a Jets fan (O.K., maybe I’m not giving up much by not watching), and I really like keeping up with their season. What involvement with the team would be ethical? Can I read up on the team in the newspaper? What if I walk into a restaurant and a game is on television? Is it O.K. if I watch it there? After all, they’ve chosen to play, and maybe I should respect that. Name WithheldA body of research suggests that football causes long-term brain damage in many players. Still, as you point out, the players are in a position to decide for themselves whether they want to run the risks. Those who do well in the sport expect to earn more money and more glory than they would in another endeavor. So you could just think this puts the responsibility on them. If they’re rational, they are, in effect, making the judgment that they are better off playing than not, even with a serious prospect of incurring chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), not to mention other chronic injuries and conditions.That’s not the end of the discussion, though. When it comes to exposing workers to hazards, our views aren’t straightforward. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2016 show 24,650 nonfatal injuries among construction workers, 28,740 injuries among local law-enforcement officers, 80,180 injuries among those for whom driving is part of their job. If you choose to be a roofer rather than a groundskeeper and accept a greater risk of injury for more pay, we’re O.K. with that. But the reason we have OSHA standards is that we think measures to abate hazards should be taken where feasible. The potential for grievous injury is surely part of why people watch Nascar races; we still expect drivers to use six-point harnesses and flame-retardant suits.It isn’t obvious how this principle should be applied to a game like football. Some think that new high-tech helmets will help; others argue that no helmets at all would be safer, because (as in rugby) it might discourage head collisions. Players spend much more time in practice than in actual games, and some think that practice needs to be reformed to avoid the subconcussive impacts that have been linked to C.T.E. There’s more research to be done, more rethinking of the rules of the game. Players who lower their heads and initiate helmet contact can now be penalized, and maybe there’s a way to expand that penalty category. The existing penalties can certainly be increased and made more of a deterrent. Shortening the preseason could help, too. But if you really care about the welfare of football players, you should want not just to turn your back on bad practices but also to advocate for better ones.A utilitarian, who assesses actions by their effects, would point out that nothing you’re proposing to do contributes to that effort. You can avoid newspaper coverage or screens in sports bars, but given your refusal to urge anyone else to refrain from attending or watching games, that gesture will be undetectable to the football authorities, not to mention sports journalists, and puts no pressure on them. (At least in picking the Jets to follow you’ve made it easier to skip every Super Bowl, from which fate seems to have decided they would be excluded for the past half-century.)But again, that’s not the end of the discussion. Might there be a reason to shun a harmful activity even if doing so won’t have beneficial effects? There are two lines of argument to consider here: one associated with Immanuel Kant and the other with Aristotle. A Kantian test for assessing an action is to consider whether it flows from a principle that you’d have reason to want everyone to follow. Let’s suppose everyone’s boycotting football would lead to swift changes to make the game much safer or even bring the sport to an end. (Here, the utilitarian would note that the end of football might lead to worse lives for those who now play the game at all levels and to the loss not just of a lot of pleasure among fans but also of jobs for commentators, stadium staff, officials and the like.) You can still wonder whether that Kantian strategy of the universalized maxim matters if, in the real world, none of your sports-fan friends are going to follow your lead.One reason to refrain from fandom is simply that you may not want to be the sort of person who takes pleasure in a game that is causing serious and unnecessary harm to its players. An approach to ethics that focuses on what kind of person you are — so-called virtue ethics — is often associated with Aristotle. It tends to judge action in terms of character, rather than the other way around, and you hear its echoes in a familiar formula of reproval: “What kind of person would ... ?”Let me offer a final consideration: In following the game, in joining the culture that sustains football, in its current form, as an American institution, you are not causing harm directly — but you are, in a sense, participating in causing harm. You’ve been enlisted in a collective action that you view with disapproval. In this regard, you can be part of the problem, even if the problem would persist if you weren’t.My husband and I are struggling to conceive. We’ve been seeing a fertility specialist and going through cycles of treatment. We started with oral medications, to which unfortunately I stopped responding. We have since moved on to injectable medications. If this doesn’t work, we’ll at some point have to start thinking about IVF. Though I desperately want to have a baby of our own, I’m struggling with whether it is ethical to go through the rather incredible lengths to get pregnant that IVF requires when there are children who urgently need homes. I know that the cost of adoption, and the difficulty of actually successfully adopting a baby, make it likely as emotionally grueling (and more expensive than) as an IVF cycle. Still, the effort would go to providing a home for a baby who needs one. More pressing is the number of children in the foster-care system. We’ve talked about fostering children in the future, but in our minds that would occur after we’d had some experience parenting. I do not feel that right now we could take on the enormous responsibility of foster care. I do feel we are ready for a baby of our own; children in foster care generally need a great deal more than a new baby does.The bottom line is this: Though I want to have a biological child, and my husband definitely does want to go to IVF if it comes to that, I am struggling to wrap my head around going through so much intervention when we could instead take in a child who needs a home. Am I off base here, or do we have a duty to give homes to children who need them when we can’t easily have children of our own? Name WithheldTaking on a child who already exists and needs a home is an enormously worthy thing to do, if you’re confident that you can bond with him or her and create a loving environment. But you don’t have a duty to adopt one. There are many things we each could do — such as being a parent to one of the hundred thousand or so foster children in this country who need a new family — that would improve the world. But morality doesn’t demand that we do all the good we can. If you had a duty to adopt a foster child, it wouldn’t be enormously worthy, just required.Plenty of couples want to conceive but would choose to have no children rather than adopt a foster child. That’s essentially the position you’re in: You don’t feel prepared to provide foster care. It follows that a child you and your husband might have together wouldn’t be depriving a foster child of a home. And you’re not obliged to remain childless."
"The Helicopter Parent Descends on College Football - The New York Times
When Leslie Smith, a high school senior from Miami, made his official visit to the University of Pittsburgh last month, he got an idea before a photo shoot in which he was to pose wearing the Panthers’ football uniform.He asked his mother, Lucretia Chapple, who was accompanying him on his visit, to put on the jersey.His request was too mild for her.“She decided, ‘I’m going to put on the whole uniform,’” Smith said.The result is a pair of pictures of Smith, who will suit up for Pitt more regularly next season as a freshman linebacker, and Chapple, who in years past played basketball and ran track. Both are clad in the school’s blue and gold colors, head to almost-toe (they did not appear to have cleats that fit Chapple). Long hair flows from the back of her helmet.“She looks pretty good in that uniform,” said Smith’s future coach, Pat Narduzzi. “She looks like a player.”Parents of college-age students have long proudly advertised where their students attend school on sweatshirts, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, etc.But football parents — a special species of sports parent — have a new twist on that this year. As national signing day dawns Wednesday, the trend du jour is parents dressing up in uniforms alongside their talented sons.The resulting shots are, of course, posted to Twitter and Instagram, from which they ricochet across the web.“I had buddies coming up to me being like, ‘You know you’re on Barstool Sports?’” said Steve Snyder, who posed alongside his son, Sam, a tight end, during Sam’s official visit to Missouri.There may be no bigger date on the calendar for college football teams than signing day, since personnel overwhelmingly dictates a team’s ultimate success or failure. For the past two years, players have also been able to sign during a brief window in December, as Smith did, but signing day is still when ultimate judgment about coaches’ recruiting is rendered.“For college football, recruiting is the lifeblood,” said Luke Stampini, a recruiting analyst at 247Sports. “If you’re not recruiting well, you’re probably not going to be around for long.”The uniform photo-op arguably reflects broader currents in child rearing. It could be cast as helicopter-parenting — or perhaps the next generation of helicopter-parenting, in which the parent ropes down from the chopper right after his child.“This is the era of ‘we’ parenting, i.e., ‘We have a midterm. We’ve got a game tomorrow. We’re being recruited by top-tier schools,’” Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former Stanford administrator and the author of “How to Raise an Adult,” said in an email.“If the child is wearing a jersey signaling their recruitment status, the we-speaking parent wants that cool jersey, too,” she said, adding, “But where does this intertwined-ness stop?”What the novelty undeniably reveals is a crucial secret to recruiting nowadays. For all the talk that prognosticators may offer about how well a certain linebacker meshes with a certain coordinator’s defensive philosophy or how successful a college program is at developing players for the N.F.L., much of recruiting comes down to the more basic element of feel. Even for top football players, college football is also college, and that means getting the family to sign on, too.“The recruiting process is not just about the player. They can’t recruit the player. They’ve got to recruit the family,” said Jamal Hill, who posed alongside his older brother, Jeffrey, who got to wear Oregon’s neon green uniform as opposed to Jamal’s black one.“It’s a long-term decision,” Hill added. “You’ve got to trust them. Once you start recruiting the whole family, that makes it go more smoothly.”During their campus visits, recruits typically tour not only football facilities but academic ones. Coaches are as likely to shoot the breeze as to draw Xs and Os on a whiteboard, hoping to make recruits — and their families — feel like their college is a suitable home-away-from-home.Steve Ognenovic — whose son Nikolas, a tight end, posed alongside his father at Pitt and Kentucky before signing with the latter — recalled a long visit with Auburn Coach Gus Malzahn. “We spent 20 minutes talking about football,” Ognenovic said. “The rest was about the new addition on his deck, the truck he bought. He’s a regular guy.”The trend can also be a way for coaches to signal to recruits, present and future, what kind of program they are running. For instance, Florida’s second-year head coach, Dan Mullen, appears intent on reintroducing to Gainesville the kind of whimsy one expects from a team whose fans do a gator-chop on game days.In contrast, a Tennessee assistant coach recently spoke out against the practice, tweeting that one of the things he prays for was “that I NEVER have to outfit someone’s dad in full gear for a photo shoot.” It is not shocking that the assistant first worked with Tennessee’s head coach, Jeremy Pruitt, when both were on the staff of Alabama’s supremely buttoned-up Nick Saban, whose recruits are probably less likely to pose alongside mom or dad.So why do some kids and parents want these photographs, which may be compelling but are also a little bit absurd? And why do they make heavy rotation on social media and in the sports blogosphere?The photos are a reminder of the human dimension in college football’s annual meat market. For all the hoopla over which program has signed the best class (spoiler: yet again, it will probably be Alabama) and which team whiffed on a prized in-state offensive lineman, often overlooked is how big a day this is for the prospects themselves, who, like so many other adolescents who are less gifted on the gridiron, are finally completing the large and much-celebrated process of deciding where to go to college.Steve Snyder said that, when a Missouri coach asked if he wanted to put a jersey on, “I thought to myself, how many opportunities am I ever going to get to have an experience like this with my son?”His son ended up signing with Baylor, and, Snyder said, friends and family had already loaded up on Bears gear. “You’re very proud parents,” he said. “Lot of hard work.”"

"White House Welcomes College Football Champions With Fast-Food Buffet - The New York Times
As is tradition, President Trump hosted the champions of college football, the Clemson Tigers, for a celebration of their athletic achievement at the White House on Monday.The food he offered them was far less traditional.Piles of burgers and fish sandwiches from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King, still in their boxes and wrappers, were served on trays in the candlelit dining room. Tubs of dipping sauces were stacked in silver gravy boats. On another table, heat lamps kept French fries and Domino’s pizzas warm. Salads were available, too.It was an opulent setting for fast-food fare. Visiting players are typically offered a meal from the White House kitchen, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the government shutdown necessitated a new menu.“Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed — so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone’s favorite fast foods,” she said.The substitution didn’t seem to bother Mr. Trump, and perhaps even delighted him.“I like it all,” he told reporters before the players arrived. “It’s all good stuff. Great American food.”Mr. Trump has long professed a love for fast food. He values its efficiency and consistency, and as a self-professed “germaphobe,” has said uniform health standards make him more confident in its cleanliness. He used to eat it several times per week.He’s far from alone in loving fast food. About one-third of American adults eat fast food on any given day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, the sight of the fast-food cartons inside the stately White House dining room struck some observers on social media as incongruous — or lacking in hospitality for a celebration. (No players looked particularly dissatisfied as cameras rolled.)It also promoted cuisine that nutritionists warn is high in calories, fat and sodium, and that increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases.Such events, ostensibly a tribute to championship teams, are unavoidably political. Mr. Trump abruptly disinvited the N.F.L. champion Philadelphia Eagles last year after most of the players and coaches said they would boycott the visit. The Golden State Warriors declined to visit after winning the N.B.A. championship last year.With reporters gathered before the players arrived, on a day he stayed inside the White House, Mr. Trump was eager to drive the discussion back to the weekslong government shutdown. After showing off the food spread, he pivoted to making his case for Republican unity and the need for the border wall.“It should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it’s going to happen now, it’s going to happen now,” he said.Without missing a beat, he continued: “Thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy your food.”"
"What We Learned About College Football in the Past Season - The New York Times
The 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way."
"Tim Tebow Takes Another Step With the Mets (and Avoids Sprinklers This Time) - The New York Times
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Ed Hobson stood up in the bleachers along the first-base line at Field 7 in the Mets’ spring training facility Saturday morning, having driven 300 miles to monitor one man.“Hoping to meet St. Timothy,” said Hobson, an assistant chief at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “We even have a four-foot alligator in front of our house. We named him Tebow because he’s the greatest Gator of all time.”He was referring, of course, to Tim Tebow, the former football player and current Mets farmhand. Hobson, a University of Florida alumnus like Tebow, had never seen him in the flesh, but he wore a T-shirt emblazoned “Team Tebow.” Hobson’s 6-year-old son, Liam, wore a replica of Tebow’s old No. 15 Florida football jersey.They were on a family pilgrimage. The night before, they hopped in a Honda Odyssey at their home near the Georgia coast to observe the latest stop on Tebow’s baseball journey. Father and son moved closer to the chain-link fence as Tebow made the first steps in his transition from a Class AA All-Star to training for the Syracuse Mets in Class AAA.Tebow, 31, strode into this third spring training with a confident gait, intent on not repeating past missteps. Last February, Tebow failed to make it past a sprinkler head during drill work and sprained his ankle. The injury worsened as a result of Tebow’s refusal to rest, and he collected just one hit in 18 at-bats, all as a designated hitter, in seven spring games.“I didn’t play one snap of outfield,” he said Saturday before catching his slip into football vernacular.Forgive Tebow. In the gig economy, he has remained on the go. During the fall and winter, he returned to work as a college football analyst for ESPN. Still, he swung in batting cages on college campuses between on-camera appearances. On the day of the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, he performed his television duties in the morning, went to Tulane University for batting practice and then returned to the stadium for the game. In a suite, he discussed his swing with his hitting coach, Jay Gibbons, the former Dodger and Oriole who travels with Tebow.“When you give me enough time, I’m going to just make up that ground, those tiny inches every day,” Tebow said. “That’s my mind-set: Just keep working; get a little bit better.”Though Tebow has been out of the N.F.L. since 2015 — and had not appeared in a regular-season game since 2012 — football still calls. In recent weeks, Tebow turned down an offer to play for Coach Steve Spurrier’s Orlando Apollos in the Alliance of American Football, a nascent league populated with former N.F.L. players like Tebow, who played three seasons. Before reporting to Mets camp, Tebow also walked down the red carpet at the premiere of “Run the Race,” a faith-based movie he co-produced with his brother, Robby.He maintained, though, that neither film nor football could lure him away from the diamond now.“No way could I stop and not give this the chance after everything I’ve worked for,” he said. “This is what I’m in now, and I’m all in.”Tebow commenced his latest campaign in the batting cage. He then ran down fly balls in the outfield, backpedaling and making over-the-shoulder catches. When he walked to home plate with his bat, he received hugs from Omar Minaya, the special assistant to the general manager; Brodie Van Wagenen, the general manager; and Fred Wilpon, the team owner. On pitch after pitch, Tebow, who batted .273 with the Class AA Binghamton Rumble Ponies last summer, turned his hips and connected with the ball. Seven of his hits cleared the right-field fence.“It’s raw power,” Manager Mickey Callaway said. “It’s real. The bat moves through the zone pretty swiftly. He’s got to continue to work on handling certain zones, but he puts the barrel on the ball, and it goes a long way.”Tebow also could not help but weigh in on the recent story that transcended both of his sports. While on assignment for ESPN, he met Kyler Murray, the Oklahoma quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy last season after being picked by Oakland in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft. Murray recently announced his decision to play football professionally, instead of baseball. Tebow, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, understood his position better than most.“I think this was a really tough decision for him,” Tebow said. “He loves two sports, and I can really relate to that. And he went with something that he’s been really good at lately and dominating in. When we talked about it, and we did talk about that, I just gave him the advice to follow your heart. Whatever you’re passionate about.”He recalled telling Murray: “You know what? Don’t do it for your agents, or your friends and sometimes necessarily even your family. Do it for what’s on your heart, and don’t let other people define you. You’re going to have all these coaches that you look up to and everybody else that’s going to tell you what they think, but what’s most important is following your heart and your passion.”Reminders of Tebow’s past life greeted him on the other side of the fence after his first workout. One spectator held up a photo of him celebrating with football teammates at Florida. Another held out a Jets jersey with his No. 15 stitched into it. Tebow scrawled his signature for children as he tucked his yellow birch bat with “John 16:33” — a Scripture passage about taking heart and finding peace — marked on the barrel beneath his arm.Anticipation grew for Donna Taaffee, a fan, as she watched him approach.“He’s getting closer!” she said. “Oh my goodness, he’s getting closer!”Tebow smiled as he passed. He then shook the hand of Hobson, whose son held out a baseball and pen for Tebow to sign. Tebow obliged.Hobson joked about catching up later on with Tebow, who recently got engaged to Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, the 2017 Miss Universe pageant winner.“My co-worker and I are going to crash his wedding,” he said."
"Will the Rose Bowl Stand in the Way of a Bigger College Football Playoff? - The New York Times
PASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”"
"N.B.A. By the Numbers: The League That Never Sleeps - The New York Times
With all of the trade drama surrounding Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis, the N.B.A. intruded on the N.F.L.’s run-up to the Super Bowl as we have not seen since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on football’s so-called Championship Sunday in 2006.Now that the Super Bowl is over and even more of North America’s sporting consciousness is there to be seized by professional basketball’s tireless headline-makers, here is our best advice: Buckle up.What follows is a by-the-numbers look at what the N.B.A.’s 73rd season has served up so far — and what the next five months hold.Through Sunday’s games, only the Milwaukee Bucks were on a 60-win pace. The Bucks’ Eastern Conference-leading record of 38-13 projects to a 61-win campaign — which could keep this season from being the league’s first since 2000-1 without a 60-win club.There are realistically 11 teams battling for the Western Conference’s eight playoff spots, after the new calendar year began with 14 teams in the conference — all but Phoenix — in the race. Dallas, New Orleans and Memphis have dropped off in January, prompting all three teams to focus more on trades than the standings.The consensus top three in the Most Valuable Player Award race coming out of Super Bowl weekend are Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Houston’s James Harden and Denver’s Nikola Jokic. According to the Basketball-Reference.com M.V.P. Award Tracker, Antetokounmpo awoke Sunday with a 37.8 percent chance of winning — far ahead of Harden’s 21.1 percent.Harden has scored at least 30 points in 26 consecutive games, good for the third-longest such streak in N.B.A. annals behind Wilt Chamberlain’s streaks of 65 and 31.The league’s trade deadline (Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern) is three days away. This is the second season since 1978-79 (as far back as reliable N.B.A. record-keeping goes) that the deadline falls before the All-Star Game.The New Orleans Pelicans have made two trips to the playoffs — winning only one series — in Davis’s first six seasons with the team. Davis requested a trade on Jan. 28.It took 54 days for the Minnesota Timberwolves to find a trade they liked for Jimmy Butler after Butler’s request to be dealt became public Sept. 18. Butler was snubbed by East coaches in All-Star voting, but the potential ceiling for Philadelphia’s rugged new star threesome was evident Thursday night at Golden State, when Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Butler and Company brought a halt to the longest winning streak of the season — after the Warriors had won 11 in a row.Minnesota is 21-18 since the trade that sent Butler and Justin Patton to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 — and 6-6 since firing Tom Thibodeau, the coach/team president who made it, on Jan. 6. Ryan Saunders, Thibodeau’s 32-year-old replacement, has many admirers around the league, but the Wolves are a long way from convincing skeptics that the deal (to bring in Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick) was sufficient for a player of Butler’s caliber.Thibodeau is one of three coaches to be fired this season — after nine coaching changes in the off-season. The other coaches to lose their jobs since opening night: Cleveland’s Tyronn Lue and Chicago’s Fred Hoiberg.There were 20 teams, entering Sunday’s play, attempting at least 30 3-pointers a game. This is poised to become the first season in N.B.A. history that the leaguewide average per game (31.4) will finish in the 30s.With coaches calling for more 3-pointers than ever before and greenlighting shots earlier and earlier in the 24-second shot clock — along with a new rule that resets the shot clock at 14 seconds on offensive rebounds — teams are averaging 100.0 possessions per 48 minutes leaguewide. The last N.B.A. season in which that figure finished in triple digits was 1988-89 (100.6).Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton, Orlando’s Nikola Vucevic, Philadelphia’s Simmons and Denver’s Jokic will make their All-Star Game debuts Feb. 17 in Charlotte, N.C. The All-Star player draft, in which the captains LeBron James and Antetokounmpo will fill out 13-man rosters by picking players playground-style, is Thursday at 7 p.m. — just four hours after the trade deadline passes. (D’Angelo Russell of the Nets, who was named later as a replacement for Indiana’s Victor Oladipo, who is injured, will also be making his All-Star debut this year.)Four teams are in contention for the league’s worst record: Phoenix (11-43), Cleveland (11-42), Chicago (12-41) and, of course, the Knicks (10-42). The teams that finish in the bottom three will share a 14 percent chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in June in the first year of the league’s revised lottery system.San Antonio sits a surprising fifth in the West, at 32-22, in its first season since trading Kawhi Leonard to Toronto in July. The Spurs are bidding for a record 22nd consecutive playoff berth, a streak that began in Gregg Popovich’s first full season as Spurs coach in 1997-98.At 27-25, Sacramento is on course to post its first winning record since the 2005-6 season. But the Kings will have to leapfrog at least two teams to stop the league’s longest playoff drought (12 seasons). The Suns (nine seasons) and the Orlando Magic (seven) are on course to extend their own playoff droughts.The Lakers’ playoff drought will hit a hard-to-believe six seasons in a row if James cannot save Los Angeles over its final 29 games. James just missed 17 consecutive games with a strained groin — the longest injury absence of his pro career — and is at risk for missing the postseason for the first time since his second N.B.A. season, in 2004-5.Carmelo Anthony finally became an unrestricted free agent on Sunday after clearing waivers nearly three months after the Houston Rockets sent him away in November after just 10 games together. The Rockets traded Anthony to Chicago on Jan. 21; the Bulls, who needed a roster spot, waived him Friday without him spending a single second with the team.In the seven games Golden State has deployed a lineup of DeMarcus Cousins, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, that group is averaging 127.1 points per 100 possessions in 54 minutes. Call it a small but ominous sample size.Oddsmakers in Las Vegas have the Warriors as overwhelming favorites to win their third consecutive championship and fourth in five seasons. According to ActionNetwork.com, Golden State is -225 to win it all, meaning that you would have to bet $225 to win $100. Boston, Milwaukee and Toronto are next in line at +1,000, meaning that a $100 bet would win $1,000 if any of those teams won the title.One scribe’s ranking of the top 10 players who could be unrestricted free agents July 1: Durant, Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Thompson, Butler, Kemba Walker, Cousins, Middleton, Marc Gasol and Tobias Harris.The N.B.A. playoffs start April 13."
"Jason Witten to Return to the Cowboys After a Year as a Broadcaster - The New York Times
Jason Witten, the ironman Dallas Cowboys tight end who retired from the N.F.L. and joined “Monday Night Football” last year, announced Thursday that he would return to the team. By the time the season starts, he will be 37.“The fire inside of me to compete and play this game is just burning too strong,” Witten said in a statement. “This team has a great group of rising young stars, and I want to help them make a run at a championship. This was completely my decision, and I am very comfortable with it. I’m looking forward to getting back in the dirt.”The Cowboys were 10-6 last season with a wild-card playoff win. But their top tight end, Blake Jarwin, had only 307 receiving yards. Dallas missed the playoffs in Witten’s last season.When Witten retired in May, he said of his decision, “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.”He made 11 Pro Bowls, including the one in his final season, and caught 1,152 passes for 12,448 yards, both Cowboys records. He ranks fourth in the N.F.L. in career catches behind Jerry Rice, Tony Gonzalez and Larry Fitzgerald. He was also known as a strong run blocker.Though he played 16 games in every season except his first, his statistics dipped in his final years. In his last season, he had 63 catches and 560 yards receiving, the lowest figures since his rookie season.Witten signed a four-year, $29.6 million contract extension with the Cowboys in 2017 but retired just one year later and joined a reimagined “Monday Night Football” booth on ESPN. He worked alongside Joe Tessitore, the play-by-play voice; Anthony McFarland, an analyst; and Lisa Salters, who reported from the sidelines.ESPN had hoped to replicate the magic happening at CBS. A year earlier, CBS had hired Witten’s quarterback with the Cowboys, Tony Romo, and made him the network’s lead football analyst. Romo was an instant hit and received near-universal praise for his ability to predict plays.But from the start, the Tessitore, McFarland and Witten booth struggled. Witten often stumbled over his lines — his most notable moment was when he said that the N.F.L. had gone “left wing” in its protection of quarterbacks — and sometimes spoke in platitudes. McFarland, instead of sitting in the broadcast booth, provided commentary from an odd cranelike contraption on the sideline that ESPN called the Booger Mobile.Witten’s performance was savaged by sports media critics, who wondered how long ESPN would keep the booth together. “‘Monday Night Football’ has a big problem: Jason Witten,” read one Boston Globe headline. Witten and Jay Rothman, the show’s producer, asked for patience, and Rothman insisted Witten’s job was safe.In a statement Thursday, ESPN thanked Witten for his contributions and said, “We understand Jason’s desire to return to the Dallas Cowboys.”ESPN said its plans for the 2019 “Monday Night Football” booth had not been determined."
"The Year the N.F.L. Bounced Back - The New York Times
ATLANTA — After the N.F.L.’s best season in years, Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, got his chance to crow on Wednesday afternoon ahead of its showcase event.“This season has demonstrated that there has never been a better time to be a part of the N.F.L.,” Goodell said. “Our game is getting better and better, and our engagement and popularity is unmatched in today’s media landscape.”Under Goodell, the N.F.L. has tried to be everywhere all the time. The combine, the draft and the minicamps have become manufactured events unto themselves; there are now games on Thursday nights and some, played in London, early on Sunday mornings; and most games have remained on network television even as other sports have largely moved their games to cable and now streaming.A year ago, the strategy was under stress. Then the emergence of a new crop of young stars and a largely controversy-free season combined to drive up television ratings and produce a spectacular weekend of conference championships, capping a winning streak that began with a surprisingly fervent auction for rights to the league’s least popular slate of games.Coming off the 2017 season, after television ratings had dropped 17 percent over the previous two years, the league entered the media market trying to sell the rights to “Thursday Night Football.” CBS and NBC had both said they lost money showing Thursday games, and they weren’t willing to pay much more than the $450 million combined they were paying each year.Then, as in 1993, when an audacious bid for N.F.L. rights ignited a scramble that sent their value soaring, Rupert Murdoch came to the rescue. Fox agreed to pay $660 million annually to show “Thursday Night Football.”Murdoch’s market-resetting bid came shortly after he agreed to sell the vast majority of his empire to Disney, leaving him with a significant need for marquee programming on his network. Also, there was real competition from a tech company.Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s chief media and business officer, said in an interview in September that Fox did not submit the highest bid. A tech company did, he said, though he would not reveal which one.“We turned down higher bids,” he said. “When you put a game exclusively on digital, are you growing the distribution and availability, or are you limiting it, and to the extent how much? And for us, we weren’t sure we wanted to do that yet.”In other words, the N.F.L. stuck to its foundational game plan to be everywhere and accessible. After two seasons of turmoil, the league opted not to break away from its longstanding strategy, but instead doubled down on it.Plenty of dangers still lurk. Football’s concussion crisis threatens the viability of youth football. Colin Kaepernick’s collusion case against the league drags on, suggesting he has a chance to win, and attendance was down to its lowest level in eight seasons. Instead of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady or Rams Coach Sean McVay, the biggest topic ahead of the Super Bowl remains atrocious officiating. The league’s collective bargaining agreement with its players expires in two years, and negotiations will be tough.But Rolapp’s big bet paid off. Every time slot for N.F.L. games, including Thursday night’s, earned higher television ratings this season, a total gain of 5 percent.Incidents of violence against women continued to plague the league. The Kansas City Chiefs cut the Pro Bowl running back Kareem Hunt during the season after video showed him shoving and kicking a woman. The New York Times later reported that the N.F.L. failed to question Hunt about the incident during an interview earlier in the year.The San Francisco 49ers cut Reuben Foster after his second arrest on domestic violence charges in 2018, and three days later he was claimed by Washington, a move that garnered substantial criticism. TMZ also published video of Washington safety Montae Nicholson punching out a man.But Goodell and the N.F.L. limited their unforced errors. There was nothing like the drawn-out legal battle over deflated footballs in 2015 and 2016. And once the N.F.L. realized the opposition it would face if it pushed ahead with a rule mandating players on the field to stand during the national anthem, the league backed off.Young players like Patrick Mahomes, Baker Mayfield, Mitchell Trubisky and Saquon Barkley became stars in 2018, pointing the way to a post-Brady world. High-profile quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck returned to form. High-octane passing offenses took over the league.It all came together in the conference championship games, which featured the four highest seeds and the four highest-scoring teams. Two veteran quarterbacks, Drew Brees and Brady, took on the best young quarterbacks, Jared Goff and Mahomes, in high-scoring shootouts that went to overtime.David Berson, the president of CBS Sports, which will televise the Super Bowl on Sunday, said fewer off-the-field stories were getting attention “because the on-field product is so compelling.” Whether Berson is correct or whether the league simply had a year with fewer controversies ultimately does not matter all that much to the league’s media partners because, as Berson put it, “The focus is on the football, and the football is really exciting.”There were blown calls and rules controversies, of course. The N.F.C. championship game hinged on an egregious no-call, and Brady and the Patriots also benefited from a questionable ruling and a rule that did not allow Mahomes — probably the league’s most valuable player — to get his hands on the football in overtime. But the arguments garnered more attention for the game, which was just what the league wanted.The question now is whether this fundamentally violent sport can be made safer. Before the season, the N.F.L. introduced a rule barring players from using their helmets as weapons when tackling. Six weeks into the season, its enforcement was essentially abandoned, underscoring how difficult it is to legislate between acceptable and unacceptable levels of violence.According to league statistics, concussions were down 29 percent in 2018, to 0.5 per game from 0.7. Jeff Miller, the N.F.L.’s executive vice president for health and safety, cautioned on a recent conference call that “there is no finishing line” when it comes to player safety, but touted the work being done to get players to wear better helmets and to present teams with targeted interventions to prevent concussions.The league’s own concussion data show that the number of concussions each year fluctuates, and that previous reductions were reversed in following seasons. The N.F.L. has also not been able to reduce the instances of A.C.L. and M.C.L. tears, ligament injuries that commonly end players’ seasons.The youth tackle football participation rate has been dropping for a decade, and now the high school tackle football participation rate is declining, too. Just one insurance company is willing to cover professional football leagues for head trauma, according to ESPN, and youth football leagues and school districts are facing insurance premiums that they are struggling to afford.In the off-season, the N.F.L. is likely to receive a ruling in the Kaepernick collusion case. His grievance, which was filed 15 months ago, still hasn’t been heard. It remains difficult for collusion to be proven, but if Kaepernick wins, he could be awarded tens of millions of dollars, and evidence uncovered in discovery and depositions could become public.Attendance in 2018 fell to its lowest level since 2011. This drop will be rectified in part in 2020 when the Los Angeles Chargers move from a 27,000-capacity soccer stadium to a 70,000-capacity football stadium, but Washington, Tampa Bay and Cincinnati all suffered big drops.The N.F.L. operates on two planes: the day-to-day of small crises and opportunities, and the issues that could take a bite out of the $15 billion-a-year league. Most things fall into the first bucket, with no chance of harming a league whose revenue inches upward each season because of television contracts signed earlier in this decade.Over the next decade, the N.F.L.’s ability to handle the changing media and technology environment and the mounting health and safety challenges is likely to determine whether it reaches its goal of $25 billion a year in revenue by 2027 and remains at the pinnacle of American sports.Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons, is confident the league will continue to prosper. He believes the N.F.L. will receive even more money when contracts to telecast Sunday and Monday games expire after the 2021 and 2022 seasons because of “the number of ways the product is distributed these days,” he said.But the root of Blank’s confidence is the league’s longstanding strategy. “The core of it is still going to be over-the-air free television,” he said. “That’s not going to change.”"
"Gronk Cruises Away from N.F.L., Leaving a Big Hole - The New York Times
There have been a host of terrific nicknames in football history, but has there ever been one better than Gronk?Yes, it’s simply the abbreviation of a last name, but in this case it seemed to symbolize the essence of the player: a no-nonsense syllable as forceful as a crunching block to seal the end on a sweep, as dynamic as a leaping touchdown grab over a hapless defender.Gronk even sounds whimsical or playful, which could not be more fitting.The man behind the nickname, New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, announced his retirement on Sunday. At 6-foot-6 and nearly 270 pounds, he always seemed larger than life, but nine years in the N.F.L. will cut anyone down to size. After he had surgeries to his back, arm and knee, even a great nickname couldn’t save Gronk, who gingerly, and wisely, walked away weeks before his 30th birthday.Everyone from his teammates to the Patriots’ hierarchy hurriedly lobbed praise at one of the best tight ends to play the game. And a league lacking in colorful characters suddenly has one fewer.Wide receiver Julian Edelman referred to Gronkowski as, “the other goat” (as in, greatest of all time). Coach Bill Belichick celebrated Gronkowski’s “unmistakably positive energy.” Tom Brady, in an Instagram post directed at Gronkowski, said the Patriots were “almost unbeatable when you were on the field.”Indeed, Gronkowski transformed the position, an achievement that will one day make him a certain Hall of Fame inductee. It wasn’t just Gronkowski’s uncommon mix of size and speed; he played with an inimitable combination of acrobatic athleticism and reckless abandon.With Gronkowski scoring 79 touchdowns in his career, it’s hard to single out one that typified his style of play, but a 19-yard catch-and-run against the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011, Gronkowski’s second season, revealed the kind of mettle he brought to every snap.Lined up in the backfield, Gronkowski grabbed a 1-yard pass from Brady, then stormed up the right sideline, where he evaded three tacklers and vaulted toward the goal line. While in the air, a low hit flipped him upside down, but he still kept his forward momentum, landing precariously in the end zone on the back of his neck. Gronk wobbled to his feet, then performed his signature spiking of the football.The Patriots won 34-3.And then there were the off-the-field antics. He danced on the field and on concert stages, chugged beers thrown to him during victory parades, impishly mugged for cameras behind the back of President Obama when the Patriots were feted at the White House. There were television and movie appearances, major roles in pro wrestling extravaganzas, and party after party where Gronk always seemed to materialize in character as the eternal goofball.Along the way, Gronkowski’s colorful personality brought life to the button-down Patriots and N.F.L.That kind of energy will be hard to replace. With pun intended, today the N.F.L. feels a little deflated.Gronkowski’s retirement may also signal another beginning of the end for the Patriots’ ever-expanding reign. It always seems like folly to forecast the impending demise of the Brady-Belichick Patriots. But Gronkowski was unlike any other tight end, and he leaves a gaping hole for New England.It is true that the Patriots’ offense is notable for how it can morph week to week and season to season. Still, stellar tight end play has been a constant to Belichick’s success, and in Gronkowski, the coach had a weapon who could be a devastating blocker, a third-down possession receiver and a downfield threat mixed into one.Good luck finding another talent like that before Brady’s career concludes.Gronkowski’s unmatched value was on full display in his last football game, the Super Bowl against the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots’ offense was hopelessly out of sync as drive after drive stalled short of scoring. To provide stability, New England turned to its running game, with Gronkowski’s punishing blocks often leading the way.Then, near the midpoint of the fourth quarter, with the game tied, the Patriots ran the same play three times in a row. It was primarily a pass play, but because Gronkowski was one of two tight ends in the huddle before each snap, the Rams had to defend the threat of a rushing attempt by leaving their base defense on the field. That meant one fewer defensive back to cover Gronkowski if he dashed downfield.Which is what happened. On the last of the three plays, Gronkowski shifted into the slot like a wide receiver and the Patriots had the mismatch they sought when Rams linebacker Cory Littleton trotted over — at the last second — to cover Gronkowski.As he had so many times before, Brady lofted a precise pass into a small opening in the defense and Gronkowski dove to make the catch inside the Rams’ 5-yard line.On the next play, Gronkowski sealed the left end with a powerful block on defensive end John Franklin-Myers, and running back Sony Michel dashed just off Gronkowski’s right hip for the go-ahead score in the Patriots’ 13-3 victory.Gronkowski briefly celebrated with teammates in the end zone after the score. Then he slowly, and somewhat laboriously, jogged off the field.About 20 minutes later, the Patriots were draped in confetti at midfield with music blaring along a makeshift stage. Belichick turned at one point and yelled, “Gronk!”Duly summoned, Gronkowski grinned at his coach, who smiled back and said: “You’re a hell of a player.”"
"Gang Green? Now the Jets Are Gang (Gotham) Green - The New York Times
The Jets, a football team that has been an N.F.L. punch line for years, asked a comedian to be the master of ceremonies at a loud, flashy event to unveil the team’s new uniforms on Thursday.J.B. Smoove, who has been a suffering Jets fan for decades, stood on the stage at Gotham Hall in Manhattan and urged the star players who were modeling the new threads to wear them proudly and become accustomed to them.“Get comfortable,” Smoove said to quarterback Sam Darnold. “These are your damn pajamas.”When a team finishes last in three consecutive seasons, and has not made the playoffs in eight, sometimes the best approach is to make cosmetic changes and laugh about it. This, after all, is a team that counts “The Butt Fumble” among its most memorable moments of the last several years, so maybe a change was in order.Yet, aside from Smoove, the Jets were very serious — even solemn, at times — about this new endeavor, treating the unveiling of the new uniform at an event space on Broadway much the way a major tech company introduces a fancy new device.There was a D.J., flashing lights, a celebratory video, cheerleaders and, of course, fans chanting J-E-T-S. It was as close as the Jets get to a parade these days.They said that work on the new uniforms began in 2014, which is a long time for anything to do with fashion. Christopher Johnson, the chairman and chief executive, quipped that it took longer to come up with the new duds than it did to build the team’s current stadium in New Jersey.But he noted that it was the perfect moment for a new look. The Jets, who were 4-12 last year, have a new coach, Adam Gase; a talented, second-year quarterback in Darnold; and several other new players, including the star running back Le’Veon Bell. The new uniforms, he said hopefully, signaled a new era for Gang Green.There was also talk of “brand identity” and a “refreshed logo,” the kind of marketing jargon that all teams use when they hope fans will buy items with the new look. (Within minutes of the unveiling, the new uniforms were featured on the home page of the N.F.L.’s website and its shop.) There was even a reference to work on the new design being “an extraordinary process,” as if it included some historic feat of engineering.“You will see the vision behind the process, including the thought, energy and excitement it took to make this change a reality,” Johnson said. “Our fans asked for this change. So did our players. It was time for a new uniform, time for a new look.”That look that fans allegedly asked for consists of a brand-new color (if that is possible) that the Jets call Gotham Green. Besides sounding like a name for a small park in Manhattan, the tint looks like a slight variation of the green it replaced.A more significant change is the new black uniform, with a hue dubbed Stealth Black, that all the players seemed to like a lot.Gone are the trademark vertical stripes on the shoulders. They were swapped out for pointy horizontal stripes that come around the shoulders and aim underneath the neckline, toward the center N.F.L. logo, which sits above the words “New York” in capital letters. It is becoming ever more popular for teams to put their nicknames on jerseys, but the city of origin is not common.The pants, both white (make that Spotlight White) and green, have the same kind of pointy stripes made popular when the Denver Broncos changed their uniform design in 1997. The straight dual stripes that gave the previous Jets uniforms a classic flavor are gone, and with them goes the traditional old logo, too.The Jets traded in the white helmet and the green NY logo that dates back, with slight variations, to the days of Joe Namath and Don Maynard. (Broadway Joe, by the way, was right there on Broadway on Thursday to sanction all the changes.)The new helmet is shiny (Gotham) green with a white logo that has the word “Jets” above a small football, a nod to the football in the old logo. (The Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the only teams with a football in their helmet logos.)When the players, including Jamal Adams, Leonard Williams, Quincy Enunwa and Darnold, were brought on stage to showcase the new look, they danced and posed and later echoed the team line that the new look is bold, innovative and fresh.“I think that a lot of old school people are going to have it grow on them,” Enunwa said and added, “It feels like a new team, in a way.”That is the point. But the Jets are only the most recent N.F.L. team to change uniforms. Some have had more success than others. The Patriots changed their uniforms in 2000, and in their second season in a darker blue color, they won the first of six Super Bowls in them.“I think that’s just a coincidence,” Darnold said. “But no, maybe it’s a telltale sign. If we don’t play well, the uniforms are going to look crummy. If we play well, then they are going to look awesome.”"
"After an N.F.L. Career, Keith Rivers Is Exploring Another Field - The New York Times
“Art gave me something to segue into,” said Keith Rivers, a former N.F.L. linebacker, at his art-filled house in Beverly Hills. “I’ve really gotten serious as far as studying, going to shows, going to all the museums I can.”Mr. Rivers, who is 32, is throwing himself into art and culture in a way few people can. He plans to move to Paris this summer and use it as a base of operations for an immersive year of learning that will include studying French and trying to visit every art museum in Europe. “That will be my art history,” he said.In the meantime, for research, he has a tall stack of old art magazines and catalogs flagged with Post-its that he referred to frequently during a recent conversation about his collection.During his rookie season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2009, Mr. Rivers bought his first piece — an Andy Warhol Electric Chair print — after a trip to the Museum of Modern Art with a woman he had been interested in when he was studying at the University of Southern California. “She was an art history major and explained Oldenburg to me,” he said. “I got curious.” She married someone else, but the curiosity remained.Since he retired from football in 2015, after also having played for the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills, Mr. Rivers has deepened his pursuit of contemporary art and owns work by Rashid Johnson, Kerry James Marshall, Kara Walker, Tony Lewis, Sonia Gomes and Arjan Martins, among others.Works with strong graphic punch dominate his walls. Raised eyebrows and furrowed foreheads peer from a large piece by John Baldessari. A text-based canvas by Barbara Kruger proclaims, “You drive a hard bargain.” Glenn Ligon’s hot pink and yellow lettering on a red canvas spells out a Richard Pryor joke. In a Cyprien Gaillard piece, the cartoon face of Chief Wahoo — the logo of the Cleveland Indians — is superimposed on a pristine American landscape.“It calls out the paradox of rooting for this mascot, a caricature of a Native American, and how outdated caricatures live on through marketing,” Mr. Rivers said.“So many guys get done with football, and they have nothing; that became their sole identity,” he said. Art has “given me a whole new structure.”These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why did you give up football?I’d been injured a lot. My interest was shifting toward things like art. If you’re not fully into football, it’s not the sport to play because you can really get hurt.How did you initially get interested in art?In high school, a girlfriend of mine was in a photography class. She’d pull me out of class sometimes to go take photos. In 2017, I was walking in Amsterdam with that same friend, who lives there, and she reminded me of that fact. I almost cried. I said, “Oh my God, you planted a seed for this passion.”How would you define the focus of your collection?At the moment I’m drawn toward art that has political meaning because of the times that we’re in. Issues of identity and language are highly important to me. There’s an element of race in the collection.That [canvas spelling out the date “Mar.3.1991”] is by Juan Capistrán, who was raised in South-Central. It is done in pig’s blood and is Rodney King day.John Edmonds does this “Hoods” series, which I just had to have. I grew up about 5 to 10 minutes away from Trayvon Martin’s murder. You can’t see anybody’s face in these photographs. With a hood, you don’t know who anyone could be from the back.Do you do a lot of research before you buy, or do you go with your gut?A little bit of both, depending on the price. Like the Glenn Ligon, I did extensive research for the best work that I could obtain. This is Lubaina Himid, the first black woman and the oldest person to win the Turner Prize. I had read about her in The New York Times, and then when I was at Basel [the art fair] this year, a friend came up and said, “You’ve got to come see this artist.” I was able to buy it quickly because something clicked.Are you involved with museums in any formal role?I’m on the executive committee for the Young Patrons Group at the Hammer Museum. It’s an opportunity to get people who are interested in art but may be intimidated. This is a great group to tear down some of those walls."
"How to Tackle Someone - The New York Times
“If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldn’t hit that door with your head,” says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. “Keep your head and neck out of the equation,” Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground — if you’re slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. “Your power comes from your legs and feet,” Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponent’s thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxer’s. Maintain momentum after contact.Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. “The technique is not skill-specific, and it’s not age-specific,” Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isn’t just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: “Some coaches love winning so much they’re willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad they’re willing to lose.”"
"Opinion | What Time Is the A.F.C. Championship Game? - The New York Times
I’m pleased that the New England Patriots made it to the A.F.C. championship game again this year. On Sunday, they’ll play the Kansas City Chiefs at 6:40 p.m., and the winner will advance to the Super Bowl.I’ve been a Patriots fan my entire life, long before they were good enough to loathe. But I won’t be watching football this weekend. I haven’t watched a single pass or tackle all season.I don’t remember much about last year’s A.F.C. championship game between the Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars. But I’ll never forget the sound.The Pats were down 14-3 with 1:23 left in the second quarter when the tight end Rob Gronkowski tried to catch a long, lofted pass from the quarterback, Tom Brady. He almost had it. But the Jags’ safety, Barry Church, hit Mr. Gronkowski just as he was pulling it down.Their hard plastic helmets hit each other with such force that — even through the tinny speakers on my television — it sounded like a rifle shot. You can see and hear the collision here.It still echoes in my ears. As the sound of the hit faded into a commercial break, I realized with absolute certainty that I couldn’t watch football anymore. There aren’t enough yards to gain or Super Bowl rings to win that are worth the cost.To use a euphemism from the era before we knew about brain damage, Mr. Gronkowski “got his bell rung.” Shaken by the impact, he struggled to his feet, wobbled and was helped off the field with a concussion. Mr. Church was fined $24,309 by the N.F.L. for an illegal hit.“I hope he’s all right,” Mr. Church said after the game. “If you go low for the knees, you are considered a dirty player, and if you go high, they throw the flag at you. It’s a bang-bang play, and I was just trying to play football.”“It’s football,” Mr. Gronkowski later told the press. “It is what it is.”And that’s the problem.The first research into the link between football and traumatic brain injury was published in 2005. Since then, the science has become impossible to ignore. In 2017, The Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of the autopsies of the brains of 111 deceased former N.F.L. players, whose relatives gave their bodies up for study. The group was not a random sample, yet 110 showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to concussions. Research published in November estimated that a minimum of 10 percent of all professional football players would develop C.T.E. at some point in their lives. Professional athletes are well compensated for their dangerous job. But the pipeline is a problem. It can take more than a decade of hard hits to make it to a college team or the pros.Research published in The Journal of Pediatrics last month found that concussion rates for youth football players were higher than previously reported. In all, some 5 percent of all youth football players receive concussions each year, a figure that may sound low, but compounds with each additional year of play. In 2017, a study found that playing football before age 12 doubled the risk of problems with behavioral regulation, apathy and executive functioning. It tripled the risk of elevated depression.It’s little wonder that lawmakers last year in New York, Illinois, California, Maryland and New Jersey introduced bills to ban or restrict youth tackle football.All this isn’t the snowflaking of the next generation of American men. It’s physics. Technology — in the form of, say, better helmets — will not save the game. Researchers note that helmets don’t prevent all concussions and might be making the problem worse, by giving players a false sense of invincibility.The dangers of the game are clear to the insurance companies that cover youth and professional leagues. An investigation published by ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” this week found that the insurance market for youth football is “fundamentally altering the economics of the sport, squeezing and even killing off programs faced with higher costs and a scarcity of available coverage.”“People say football will never go away, but if we can't get insurance, it will,” Jon Butler, the executive director of the youth football program Pop Warner, is reported to have said. The report said that the N.F.L. is also having problems finding companies willing to insure against head injuries.With no safe way to play — short of flag football — it’s little wonder that participation in youth football is on the decline. Some high schools have dropped the sport altogether, while state legislatures are passing and updating concussion laws to ensure schools that do field teams take the issue seriously. Every state now has a concussion law on the books.Nor is it surprising that some younger N.F.L. players are calling it quits. Mr. Gronkowski, now 29, reportedly considered retirement after last season. Reports say he’s considering doing so after this one, too.There are still Newton deniers, who contest his laws of physics, which explain how the human brain slams into the interior walls of the skull during a concussion.“Your body gets used to the hits,” the Patriots’ Tom Brady told a sports radio show last month. “The brain understands the position that you are putting your body into, and my brain is wired for contact. I would say in some ways it has become callous to some of the hits.”Mr. Brady’s former teammate, Ted Johnson, spent 10 years in the N.F.L. and told The Times in 2007, at age 34, that he was suffering from symptoms characteristic of early Alzheimer’s disease as a results of concussions. “There's something wrong with my brain,” he said.Mr. Johnson called Mr. Brady’s recent remarks about concussions “irresponsible.” “I’ll be honest, and I love Tom, it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit,” he said.Despite all these concerns, there’s little indication that football will be dethroned as America’s favorite sport. Television ratings, which have taken some hard hits of their own over the past few years, have rebounded this season. And the Super Bowl might be the most communal experience the country has in 2019.This Sunday, I won’t begrudge my father, who’ll watch the game delayed on DVR, so he doesn’t have to endure commercials to get to the 11 minutes of action. Nor my cousin, who’ll bet money on the game. Seeing the occasional Patriots hat or jersey on the street is a nice reminder of the tribe I’ve parted ways with. Because as long as I can hear the sound of Gronk getting his bell rung, I’ll find something else to watch. "
"Long Before Alabama, the South Had Sewanee - The New York Times
Long before Alabama — and now Clemson — rose as proud football powers, the 1899 University of the South football team, familiarly known as the Sewanee Tigers, provided a blueprint for Southern college football domination. Alabama and Clemson would surely crush the Tigers, but the copyright for how to dominate an era of college football would probably belong to Sewanee, not Alabama or its opponent in Monday night’s national championship game, Clemson.[Alabama vs. Clemson: Follow our live coverage from the national championship game]The idealization of the football player in the South? The idea of tying a Southern university’s identity to football? They go back at least as far as Sewanee. The pursuit of money to keep a college football program greased for greatness? That is another trademark at least 119 years old.The Crimson Tide can capture their sixth national title in 10 years with a win over Clemson on Monday in Santa Clara, Calif. Clemson beat Alabama two years ago, and this is the third time the two teams have met for the championship in four years.But Sewanee, Tenn., a small town on the Cumberland Plateau, created the template for the flush, modern, Southern football powerhouse, and it has been used time and again in the past 60 years, reaching its apotheosis at Alabama under Coach Nick Saban. Sewanee was led by one of the first forward thinkers of Southern football, Luke Lea (pronounced LEE), its 22-year-old team manager. The equivalent of an athletic director today, Lea put together a five-game, six-day, 2,300-mile trip by train through the South because he needed money to finance the 1899 team, and barnstorming was the only way to get it.While most college teams were playing four or five games a season, Sewanee played 12. Lea scheduled moneymaking games against the University of Texas and Texas A&M at the front end of the trip and games with Tulane, Louisiana State and the University of Mississippi on the back end.“Luke Lea’s canniness and caginess is what made that program possible,” said Woody Register, a history professor at the University of the South who has researched the 1899 team. “It connects him to generations of program designers.”Lea, who became a United States senator at age 32, is considered the first to come up with the idea of having trainers on road trips to take care of the players and massage their weary legs back into playing shape. He created a team that was a merciless bully: The Tigers were 12-0 and outscored opponents, 322-10. Sewanee could not pass the football, as per the rules of the day, and it would be no match for Alabama or Clemson. The team was also entirely white. The first African-American student to graduate from Sewanee, Nathaniel Owens, entered in 1966 and graduated in 1970. He was an outstanding football player. Nonetheless, Norman Jetmundsen Jr., a Birmingham lawyer who is putting together a documentary on the Sewanee team, is certain today’s elite teams would be impressed with the Tigers.“They played 35 consecutive minutes a half on both sides of the ball with no substitution, and they played with serious injuries,” Jetmundsen said. “They played five games in six days on that train trip and won them all by shutout. Who wouldn’t be impressed by that?”In a chapter of a book on the history of Sewanee, Register wrote that the 1899 team “formed part of the university’s heritage.” The professor said that Benjamin Lawton Wiggins, the university’s vice chancellor at the time, in particular, rallied students around the notion that football should be a part of the Southern male’s identity. At the time, the South was desperate for cheer, and Sewanee’s success was seen as a response to the aristocratic Northerners of the day, who thought they owned the game. Football was something Southerners could excel at, especially in the aftermath of defeat in the Civil War and economic depression, said George Rable, an American historian.“The 1890s were a rough time for the nation economically, but especially for the South,” Rable said. “Football provided some comfort and sense of achievement.” The Tigers lived by the notion that football players required a roughneck quality and a deep resolve. Jetmundsen said halfback Henry Seibels, who was known as Diddy, suffered a gash on his head in the game with Texas, but continued playing when the wound was covered with quick-setting plaster. Lineman Wild Bill Claiborne played with an eye patch, ostensibly to protect an injury. He would look across at his opponent, gesture to the patch, and declare: “This is what happened in the last game. Let’s see what happens today.”Fullback Ormond Simkins wore heavy knee braces as he battered into the line. His legs were eventually amputated below the knee because of football injuries.When the Southeastern Conference was created in 1932, Sewanee was a charter member, even though its days of being a powerhouse were long over. Inclusion was a tribute to the 1899 Tigers, a team for which Alabama’s Saban is a worthy descendant. Saban was the first coach in the SEC to consistently adopt a season-opening game in a neutral, big city for money and exposure when Alabama played Clemson in Atlanta in 2008. Now, marquee matchups at the start of the season are a regular occurrence across college football. Saban is also the primary fund-raiser for football facilities on campus, which are among the best nationally. He knows what Lea did — success requires money. “There is a connection between then and now because there is a significant money element at the center of the sport, and money is an unavoidable element of the game of college football,” Register said. “To have a mighty program, and be the champions of the South, which was their real aspiration, that required money.”Saban has been a catalyst for football programs, Clemson among them, to add layers and layers of support staff, more than a century after Sewanee added trainers. And the Crimson Tide (13-0) are as merciless as they come. They outscored opponents by 33.1 points a game this season, the biggest margin in the country. Clemson was second at 30.6. Alabama and college football, in general, have become symbols of pride in the New South. As in 1899, Rable said, “there is still a sectional quality to the football” that has its roots in the sentiments created by the Civil War. If a team from the Southeastern Conference is throttling a team from another conference, he added, “you can hear chants of ‘SEC, SEC, SEC.’”The ghosts of the Sewanee Tigers, nicknamed the Ironmen, would surely approve."

"Opinion | The Super Bowl That Trump’s America Deserves - The New York Times
I’m not really sure why they’re bothering with a Super Bowl this year. Sure, a bunch of people will make a boatload of money, tens of millions of us will reflexively tune in and we’ll find rare common ground over how cheesy the halftime show is. But are we believers anymore? Will we really see the winner as the winner — or just as the charmed survivor of a grossly tarnished process? Be it the New England Patriots or the Los Angeles Rams, the team will have an asterisk after its name. And that asterisk is a big fat sign of the times. I’m referring, of course, to the miserable officiating that’s arguably the reason the Patriots beat the Kansas City Chiefs and the Rams beat the New Orleans Saints, leading to the matchup in this coming Sunday’s season-finale game. The Rams in particular were blessed by the referees, who failed to note and penalize a glaring case of pass interference in the climactic minutes. I needn’t describe what happened. Footage of it has been replayed as extensively and analyzed as exhaustively as the Zapruder film.And it has prompted an intensity of protest, a magnitude of soul searching and a depth of cynicism that go well beyond the crime in question. That’s where the feelings about the Super Bowl and the mood of America converge.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] We’re still reeling from a presidential election that was colored if not corrupted by unfair advantages, undue meddling and disrespected rules, and here we have a Super Bowl that’s colored if not corrupted by unfair advantages, undue meddling and disrespected rules. Many fans are rejecting its legitimacy — sound familiar? There are conspiracy theories afoot.Americans are so down on, and distrustful of, major institutions and authorities that we’re primed to declare their fraudulence, and the National Football League and the Super Bowl are on the receiving end of that. They’re not fresh targets, not by any stretch. But this time we've lost all sense of perspective. The missed pass-interference call in the clash between the Rams and Saints was certainly egregious, but every football game is a compendium of good and bad breaks; luck is always a factor and often the deciding one. The Saints had home-field advantage, and their fans created enough noise to addle and even paralyze the Rams on offense. The Saints also made errors galore, blowing the possibility of a lead too commanding to be erased by poor officiating. On a recent episode of his podcast, the sports commentator Bill Simmons methodically broke down the game en route to this conclusion: “I really thought the Rams were better.” He added that “if that’s a neutral field, I think the Rams win.”That the Rams did win, with an assist from somnambulistic referees, has not gone over well in New Orleans. The Louisiana governor wrote a letter of condemnation to N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. The New Orleans City Council is considering a formal resolution declaring the outcome an “injustice” and demanding that the N.F.L. thoroughly review its rules. One of Louisiana’s senators has called for a congressional hearing on the matter.Several Saints ticket holders have filed lawsuits against the N.F.L., variously claiming that they have endured mental anguish, lost the enjoyment of life and been defrauded by the league. A movement in New Orleans to boycott the Super Bowl involves the staging of competing events, vows by many bars not to show the game and pledges by many other bars to show, instead, the 2010 Super Bowl, in which the Saints beat the Indianapolis Colts. The team’s fans, in other words, can choose an alternative reality. Again, sound familiar?Outside Louisiana, there have been murmurs about the fact that four referees in the Rams-Saints contest live in Southern California: Was a secret pro-Rams bias at work? There has also been angst about the speed of players now, the intricacies of the rule book, the ease of instant replay and what all of that portends. “What if this was the moment that blew all of our commonly held notions about officiating to pieces and made us really, truly question whether the game in its current state can really be adequately overseen by referees at all?” asked Conor Orr, epically, on Sports Illustrated’s website.On Deadspin.com, Tom Ley went further, writing that football today “requires you to sit on your couch for three hours and spend the whole time questioning if what you saw is really what you saw.” The referees, the videotape and the fans have conflicting perceptions and wind up telling diverging stories — not just about the pass-interference bungle but about a roughing-the-passer penalty on a Chiefs player who, to my eyes, did nothing more than fail to blow Tom Brady an air kiss at the end of the play. That decision, too, was possibly game-changing, graduating Brady to a Super Bowl in which he may not belong.Football has never been entirely fair, any more than life is. In the past, the Patriots were caught spying on other teams; the Saints were punished for deliberately trying to injure opposing teams’ players. Critics gasped and the band played on. Maybe the same will happen this time.Or maybe the post-truth era has found its post-truth sport."
"Warren Wells, Star Receiver With a Derailed Career, Dies at 76 - The New York Times
Warren Wells, a former wide receiver who became one of the most feared deep threats of the vaunted Oakland Raiders of the late 1960s, but whose career ended after he served a season-long prison sentence, died on Thursday at a hospital in Beaumont, Tex. He was 76.His death, after a heart attack, was confirmed by his son, Gary Stewart.Wells joined the Raiders in 1967, during the waning years of the American Football League, when the team was a perennial playoff contender. Under Coach John Rauch and later John Madden, and with Daryle Lamonica and occasionally George Blanda at quarterback, the team was known for its long-bomb offense.Wells, who stood 6 feet 1 inch and weighed a little under 200 pounds, was a cornerstone of that offense, with soft hands, slick moves and breakaway speed. His presence on the field also helped free up other talented receivers, like the Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff.“It was fantastic to watch him play,” Biletnikoff was quoted as saying in a memorial to Wells on the Raiders’ website. “He has speed, he could run routes, he was so smooth, he could get on top of defensive backs so quick.”Wells helped the Raiders reach three straight A.F.L. title games, from 1967 through 1969, and the first American Football Conference championship game after the A.F.L. merged with the National Football League in 1970.During Wells’s four seasons with Oakland, he caught 156 passes for 3,634 yards and 42 touchdowns and was twice chosen for the Pro Bowl. His best season was 1969, when he led the A.F.L. in receiving yards (1,260), touchdowns (14) and yards per catch (an astonishing 26.8).Wells had numerous highlight-reel plays. One came when the Raiders were down by 6 points with seconds left in a game against the Jets in December 1970. Lamonica threw 33 yards to Wells, who was surrounded by three Jets defenders in the end zone. One defender tipped the ball, and Wells snagged it for a touchdown. The Raiders won, 14-13, after Blanda kicked the extra point with one second on the clock.But Wells’s success on the field became overshadowed by his problems off it. He was charged in a sexual assault case, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was placed on probation in 1969.After the 1970 season, he got into a fracas at a bar in Beaumont that violated his probation. He missed the 1971 season while serving a prison term for the probation violation, and though he tried to return in 1972, he was no longer in playing shape.“Warren just isn’t ready to play professional football at this time,” Madden, the Raiders’ coach, told reporters.Over the next few years, Wells was charged with drunken driving and disturbing the peace. He never played another professional game.Wells was born on Nov. 14, 1942, in Franklin, La., to Julia and Henry Wells and grew up in Beaumont. His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a mechanic. He went to Hebert High School in Beaumont and attended Texas Southern University before being picked by the Detroit Lions in the 12th round of the 1964 N.F.L. draft.Wells played in nine games for the Lions in 1964 and, after the season ended, was drafted into the Army. He spent two years serving in Alaska and joined the Raiders after his tour.In addition to his son, Gary, he is survived by a sister, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.Wells dealt with dementia and alcoholism for years after his professional career and was cared for by his son and other family members, including Wells’s sister-in-law, Consetta Wells; a nephew, Wyron Wells; and a niece, Raquel Wells-Joseph.Gary Wells said that his father finally gave up alcohol for good years ago. Wyron Wells said that Wells’s brain was being checked for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found in a number of former football players.In 1999 Wells told The Associated Press that he had to “look toward the future and quit looking back” in order to reclaim his life.“I need to forget about that period, what happened in Oakland, and get my life straight,” he said."
"In the Case of Kyler Murray, the A’s Bet Big and Lost - The New York Times
The Oakland Athletics were overjoyed to choose Kyler Murray with the ninth pick in the baseball draft last June.“We just don’t see athletes like this on the baseball field very often,” their scouting director, Eric Kubota, said then, praising Murray’s instincts despite his relative lack of baseball experience. “He’s just a tremendous athlete, which can translate to the baseball field in a lot of ways. He has a chance to really be dominant on both the offensive end and from a defensive standpoint.”Kubota said the risk of Murray’s playing quarterback at the University of Oklahoma was worth taking.“Frankly, we’re kind of excited to be an Oklahoma fan for 12 games,” he said.Everybody knows what happened next. Those 12 regular-season games led to the conference title game and the Orange Bowl, and by the end, Murray had more than 5,000 all-purpose yards, 54 overall touchdowns, a Heisman Trophy — and a new career path.Murray announced via Twitter on Monday that he was “firmly and fully committing my life and time to becoming an N.F.L. quarterback.” His statement made no mention of baseball, the A’s, or the $4.6 million deal he reached with them last June, with the promise to play only baseball after the 2018 college football season.The A’s were the first team to hold formal workouts for pitchers and catchers on Monday — they started earlier than other teams, to prepare for a season-opening series in Japan with the Seattle Mariners on March 20 and 21 — and Murray will not be joining them. He will return $1.29 million of his $1.5 million signing bonus, according to ESPN, and will not collect the remaining $3.16 million that he was due to be paid next month.He had been assigned a locker in the clubhouse, and on Monday morning, Oakland officials had expressed hope that Murray would soon slip into his No. 73 jersey.Bob Melvin, the A’s manager, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Murray would choose baseball, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Yet, realistically, those hopes had been dimming since Murray declared for the N.F.L. draft on Jan. 14. The A’s retain his rights should Murray ever reconsider, but they will get no compensation pick for his defection. They gambled and lost — but baseball lost even bigger.Murray teased the possibility of playing both sports in a photo he posted to Twitter in November, re-enacting a ubiquitous Bo Jackson photo from the 1980s by posing shirtless with football pads on his shoulders and a baseball bat behind his back.But Jackson, of course, did not play quarterback, an all-consuming position that leaves no room for distraction. To maximize his appeal to teams — and his potential for success — Murray chose football exclusively, which most likely will bring him more money, at least at first, and definitely offers a quicker path to glory.The sports are fundamentally different in their development processes, of course. Almost every baseball player logs years in the minors, riding buses to remote outposts for a punishing daily test that is at least as much mental as physical. A first-round N.F.L. quarterback is typically hailed as the instant savior of his franchise.Murray’s predecessor as Heisman Trophy winner and Oklahoma quarterback, Baker Mayfield, needed one month to establish himself as the starter for the Cleveland Browns. He sat the first two weeks, came off the bench in Week 3 and was starting for good by Sept. 30. What’s more appealing to a 21-year-old athlete: the Mayfield plan, or a summer trying to hit sliders for an A’s affiliate in Beloit, Wis., or Stockton, Calif.?Murray’s uncle, Calvin Murray, offers an example of the uncertainties of life as a baseball prospect. The San Francisco Giants chose Calvin Murray with the seventh overall pick in the 1992 draft. He played more than 1,600 professional games, but fewer than 300 in the majors. The player taken one pick before Murray did just a bit better. His name was Derek Jeter.We’ll probably never know what Kyler Murray could have been as a baseball player. He could always try the sport again if football fizzles, as Tim Tebow is doing with the Mets. But baseball, as an institution, does not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like Murray, whose bonus potential was limited by the strict draft-slotting system instituted in 2012.The draft system has always incentivized losing, to some extent — in 2009 and 2010, the Washington Nationals plotted a new course by taking Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper first over all in consecutive drafts. But by awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to teams — with the worst team getting by far the largest allowance — the new rules have greatly encouraged protracted rebuilding.The Houston Astros understood this better than most, and became a perennial power by using the system to their advantage. They have spawned so many imitators that a record eight teams tallied 95 losses last season.The players’ union has been dismayed by this trend, which has lessened demand — and therefore salaries — for veteran free agents. Murray’s case shows another regrettable consequence. Perhaps if the A’s had been able to offer more money to Murray last June, they could have kept him off the football field entirely.Instead, their $4.6 million bought only a half-measure, allowing Murray one final fling with an old flame. As it turns out, he fell truly, madly, deeply back in love. The A’s get their ring back, but baseball is left at the altar."
"How Boring Was the Super Bowl? The Punts Got Exciting - The New York Times
ATLANTA — “It’s getting exciting now,” Jim Nantz of CBS said in mock excitement in the second half of the Super Bowl on Sunday night.He was talking about a punt.Los Angeles Rams punter Johnny Hekker’s 65-yard roller set the record for longest Super Bowl punt, and through three quarters, with a score of a 3-3, it truly was the most exciting play.Nantz’s CBS broadcast partner, Tony Romo, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, had been the subject of much news coverage leading up to Sunday, mostly for his ability to predict plays and for the infectious enthusiasm he brings to his work.But by the time of Hekker’s punt almost halfway through the third quarter, the game’s dullness seemed to have broken even him.“This is hard to watch,” Romo said. “I mean, this is how many punts in a row?”For the Rams, it was the eighth consecutive possession ending in a punt. As Hekker’s kick from the end zone tumbled to the Patriots’ 29-yard line, Nantz mused that it could set the record.“Oh, you’ve been waiting for a stat like that,” Romo teased him.“That’s it!” Nantz yelled. “That’s the highlight of the game.”Hekker turned out to be the closest thing to a star the Rams could muster. A squad that finished the regular season as the second-highest-scoring team in football finished the Super Bowl without a touchdown, in a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots.The collapse of the offense was not missed by the players who participated in the losing effort.“Last time I checked, defense wins championships,” C. J. Anderson, the Rams’ backup running back, said after a game in which his team managed just 57 total yards in the first half. “That saying has been in football for a long time.”The game, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in N.F.L. history, was hardly one to remember for the Patriots offense, which plodded along to 407 yards and just one touchdown, but it offered no shortage of ways to sum up the Rams’ offensive ineptitude.■ The Rams ended all of their drives with punts until Greg Zuerlein kicked a field goal with 2 minutes 11 seconds left in the third quarter. Even that one could hardly be described as an offensive triumph, as Zuerlein, nursing a heel injury, had to connect from 53 yards out. In all, the Rams’ drive chart looked brutal: punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, field goal, punt, interception, missed field goal.■ Todd Gurley, who led the N.F.L. with 21 total touchdowns this season, ran for just 35 yards on 10 carries and caught one pass for minus-1 yard. His plus-size backup, Anderson, ran for 22 yards on seven carries. Anderson credited the Patriots’ gap control with stopping both him and Gurley. “Obviously neither of us got going,” Anderson said, “so you’ve got to give it to New England on that.”■ Partly as a result of that stymied running game, Jared Goff, the team’s superstar third-year quarterback, spent the entire game running for his life. He may have been sacked just four times, but he was hit by a Patriots defender on 12 other plays. The constant pressure resulted in nearly all of his throws being rushed.■ It was the first time since Coach Sean McVay took over the team that the Rams were shut out in a first half, and it was just the second time in 36 games (including the playoffs) that they were held without a touchdown.■ Los Angeles never ran a play in the red zone. The team’s best effort got it to New England’s 27-yard line before Goff threw an interception that essentially handed the win to the Patriots.■ The Rams converted just 3 of 13 third-down plays.■ They were held below 300 total yards for just the second time this season.■ They were penalized for 65 yards and rushed for just 62.In all, that collection of offensive atrocities led to Hekker’s punting the ball nine times for 417 yards, only the third most in Super Bowl history, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. Baltimore’s Kyle Richardson set the record with 430 in the Baltimore Ravens’ win over the Giants in Super Bowl XXXV. That game resulted in a whopping 852 combined punting yards, making this game’s 632 combined yards seem pedestrian.Hekker’s effort gave Nantz a record to tout, and it gave the punter’s family something to watch. But for the Rams, who came into the week as the leaders of the N.F.L.’s offensive revolution, the game offered little beyond disappointment."
"Robert Kraft Pleads Not Guilty to Prostitution Charges - The New York Times
Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the N.F.L.’s New England Patriots, has pleaded not guilty in Florida to charges of soliciting prostitution.The plea, on two first-degree misdemeanor charges, were submitted in writing to the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach County, not in person. Mr. Kraft requested a nonjury trial. The plea was filed Monday and made public on Thursday.Mr. Kraft was charged with two first-degree misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution. He was one of 25 people charged by the state attorney. If convicted, Mr. Kraft would face up to one year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service. However, at a news conference on Monday, the state attorney, Dave Aronberg, said that first-time offenders rarely spent time in jail.Mr. Kraft has a scheduled court date of March 27 in Florida. He is not required to be present and most likely will be represented by his lawyer, Jack Goldberger.The plea was not a surprise. When news of the charges against Mr. Kraft broke last week, a Patriots spokesman said, “We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.”Mr. Kraft could also face discipline from N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell has broad powers to penalize not only players but also league executives and team owners. Mr. Kraft can be fined up to $500,000 and suspended for several games, which would mean he would have to stay away from the team’s practice site and stadium. If Mr. Goodell seeks a harsher penalty, he would need the approval of the other owners.A few owners have been penalized in prior years, but those punishments were for felony convictions. While Mr. Kraft’s legal case is less severe, and the charges could be reduced or dropped, the league could still punish him for “conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football.”The league has tried to address criticism that it has been too lenient with players accused of domestic abuse. Teams, too, have been criticized for mistreating their cheerleaders. The N.F.L. has also supported efforts by law enforcement agencies to combat human sex trafficking.Mr. Kraft has also donated heavily to My Life, My Choice, a nonprofit organization in Boston that supports girls who were exploited by the commercial sex industry.The police said they had captured Mr. Kraft on video during two visits to a storefront massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla., a 30-minute drive from Palm Beach, where Mr. Kraft stays when he is in Florida.According to the affidavit, he visited the parlor on Jan. 19, arriving in a Bentley driven by a chauffeur. Hidden-camera recordings showed Mr. Kraft entering the massage parlor, and a woman massaging his genitals.The next day, Mr. Kraft returned in a different chauffeur-driven Bentley for a 14-minute visit that included another sex act, according to the affidavit. Later that day, he flew to Kansas City, Mo., where the Patriots beat the Chiefs in the A.F.C. championship game to earn a berth in the Super Bowl.Two weeks later, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, to win their sixth Super Bowl title under Mr. Kraft’s ownership, which began in 1994."
"Patriots Owner Robert Kraft Faces Biggest Test of His Power - The New York Times
Two Fridays ago, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, was in Los Angeles, one of his homes away from home.He started the day at Nate and Al’s, the Beverly Hills delicatessen where he occasionally dines with friends, including Larry King and Steve Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants. Later that day, he was supposed to play golf with Al Michaels, the longtime host of “Sunday Night Football.”Kraft never made it to the first tee at the Bel-Air Country Club. During the morning he received word that the police 2,600 miles away in Florida were charging him with two counts of soliciting a prostitute at a massage parlor in Jupiter. Since then, authorities have revealed that Kraft is one of hundreds of men facing solicitation charges as part of a case that also encompasses suspected human trafficking in South Florida.[Read more: Behind Illicit Massage Parlors Lie a Vast Crime Network and Modern Indentured Servitude]Suddenly, Kraft’s off-season, and perhaps his status as one of the most influential N.F.L. owners, had been turned upside down.It is telling that he received the news while in Los Angeles, the capital of the entertainment industry. In the quarter-century since he bought the Patriots, Kraft has been at the center of countless business decisions affecting the league, from labor agreements to franchise sales to the commissioner’s compensation. But Kraft has also left his mark by forming friendships with the leaders of the media companies that pay billions of dollars to televise N.F.L. games.Those contracts account for about half of the N.F.L.’s estimated $14 billion annual revenue. As the chairman of the league’s media committee, Kraft has become the N.F.L.’s seemingly indispensable owner, as anyone who holds that position usually is, and he has been expert at getting networks like CBS and Fox to pay previously unimaginable rights fees, and making them feel as if they were lucky to do so.“He is a clever negotiator,” said David Hill, the former chairman of Fox Sports. “He could look at what the broadcaster needed and gauge what they felt they could pay but still leave something on the table so you don’t feel like you were gouged.”Now Kraft may have compromised his stature within that most exclusive of American business clubs. In addition to any league punishment, he faces up to one year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service — though since this would be a first-time offense, prosecutors said, he is unlikely to spend any time behind bars if convicted.On Feb. 25, Kraft pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges. A date in court, where he is likely to be represented by his lawyer, is scheduled for March 27.Kraft’s behavior has come under scrutiny before. He has admitted to meddling in football decisions and alienating his coaches in his early years of owning the Patriots. In 2008, he apologized after his team was fined $250,000 and lost a first-round draft pick because of allegations in 2007 that the Patriots videotaped their opponent’s offensive or defensive signals. Coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000. In 2013, Kraft claimed he was “duped” by Aaron Hernandez, the Patriots tight end who was convicted of murder and later killed himself in prison.In ownership circles, Kraft is known to act as a kind of shadow commissioner, forming close relationships with sponsors, vendors, media companies and even the N.F.L. Players Association, and pursuing back-channel communications that can sometimes circumvent his fellow owners and league officials.His influence, though, has limits. Many owners tolerate Kraft’s freelancing because he gets results and tries to keep other owners in the loop. But their tolerance runs thin when his team is accused of wrongdoing, as happened in the Spygate scandal and in 2015, when the Patriots were accused of deflating footballs before the A.F.C. championship game. In those cases, owners were not unhappy when the commissioner penalized the team.Numerous former and current league executives and Kraft’s ownership brethren declined to comment on the record for this article, as did Kraft. Even privately, many of them were reluctant to criticize him for the solicitation charges, which they consider a personal matter.It is possible, though, that the arrest could diminish Kraft’s standing among the owners just as his skill sets and relationships are needed.The league’s television contracts are up for renewal in two years, and the N.F.L. would like new players like Amazon to jump into the fray. Negotiations are likely to be complicated as the league and networks figure out how to value rights for streaming and other new technology. Kraft lost a major ally in Leslie Moonves, his longtime friend, who was forced to step down as chief executive of CBS in September after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct.If Kraft is concerned about his own allegations, he is not showing it. While he has not spoken publicly about the charges, which the police said stem from video recordings of him, Kraft has been seen in public, including at a pre-Oscars brunch on Feb. 23 where he was photographed with Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive.When Kraft returned to Boston the next day, he was spotted hugging Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after they got off a private jet.Amid the solicitation case in Florida, it is unclear how involved Kraft will be in league business in the coming months. The N.F.L. is preparing not only for talks with television networks but also for negotiations with the players’ union, whose contract expires at the end of next season. Kraft also sits on the finance and compensation committees, and the management council, which represents the league in labor talks.Kraft can be an affable but cunning negotiator, and both his business and people skills were hard to miss in 2011 during negotiations over the collective bargaining agreement. Several owners pushed the league to take a hard line and exploit their leverage over the players’ union after a court ruling in their favor, but Kraft was among a contingent of owners leading negotiations in Washington who saw an opening to push the talks across the finish line. While Kraft shuttled back and forth to Boston, where his wife, Myra, was dying of ovarian cancer, he maintained a direct line of communication with leaders of the players’ union.After the two sides reached a deal, Jeff Saturday, a member of the union’s executive committee, thanked Kraft. “Without him, this deal does not get done,” he said at the time.ESPN, where Saturday works, said he was not available for an interview. But nearly all of Kraft’s associates contacted for this article said Kraft was a careful listener who asked questions and had a knack for proposing solutions. While he does have a temper, they said, he rarely loses it.Kraft has spoken often about the need to put league matters over personal ones. In November 2017, he was interviewed with his oldest son, Jonathan, onstage at a sports industry conference in New York. In a thinly veiled criticism of Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ owner, Kraft urged owners to act as partners and not perceive themselves as “bigger than the league itself.” Jones had threatened to sue Kraft and other owners who wanted to extend Commissioner Roger Goodell’s contract.“It’s more important,” Kraft said, “that the people running the league do the right thing for the league than for any one franchise.”"
"This Super Bowl Is Not Everyone’s Bowl of Chips - The New York Times
Some cities are not all in on the Super Bowl this year. And those places include the city where the game is being held and the city that one of the two teams calls home.But which city is offering up the most indifference to Sunday’s matchup between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams? There are four chief candidates.St. Louis was the home of the Rams for 21 years, but more recently not the home of the Rams for the past three years. Fans there are still angry their team left after the 2015 season. Few are excited about the Super Bowl, and fewer still expect to root for the Rams.“Since the Rams left, I’ve watched little to no football. If it’s on a television, I look elsewhere,” the former Rams fan Dan Buffa wrote in an essay on KSDK titled, “Why I Won’t Be Watching the Super Bowl.”Fans are especially bitter about the way the Rams’ owner, Stan Kroenke, a Missouri native, left town with the team: with a flurry of dismissive comments about the city’s economic prospects. In an objection to a plan to finance a new stadium in St. Louis, he wrote: “Any N.F.L. club that signs on to this proposal in St. Louis will be well on the road to financial ruin, and the league will be harmed.”And to many onetime Rams fans, it seemed as if the team didn’t turn on the real effort to win until the move. Sure, the St. Louis Rams went to two Super Bowls, winning in the 1999 season. But after 12 straight seasons at .500 and below in St. Louis, the team waited till it got to Los Angeles to fire Coach Jeff Fisher and bring in the young genius Sean McVay, who brought immediate success.St. Louis fans don’t feel much good will toward the Patriots, either, since that was the team that beat St. Louis in its last trip to the Super Bowl, in 2002. That Rams team, known as the Greatest Show on Turf, was a 14-point favorite. And many former Rams players, including Marshall Faulk, have contended that New England cheated by filming the Rams’ walk-through the day before the game.“Is there anywhere in the rule book that both teams can lose?” a fan named James Heredia asked CBS.Falling a game short of the Super Bowl is painful. When a major reason is a blown call, it stings even more. The agony of losing the N.F.C. conference championship game to the Rams has led many Saints fans to turn their back on the big game.Don’t believe us. Believe the governor.“I’ll be honest — I don’t know anyone who has interest in watching the game in our entire state,” Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana told USA Today. He added the opinion that “it was the worst call in the history of the N.F.L.”It was only two weeks ago, but to refresh your memory: Late in a tied game, with the Saints driving, Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman slammed into New Orleans receiver Tommylee Lewis. It looked like pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet hit, or both. But there was no call, the pass was ruled incomplete, and the Saints had to settle for a field goal. The Rams had time to match that field goal, then won in overtime.On Wednesday, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., acknowledged the officiating crew messed up on the play.The loss, combined with the recent trade request of the Pelicans star Anthony Davis, led Jeff Duncan of The Times-Picayune to write: “With the notable exception of the fall of 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, I can’t think of a worse period in our city’s sports history.”Eater New Orleans offered a list of “12 Places to Avoid Super Bowl LIII,” bars and restaurants that promise not to show the game on any of their televisions. In some cases, they will instead show a replay of the Saints’ championship from nine years ago.Nola.com has 25 reasons not to watch the Super Bowl, but “could come up with 325.”There’s enough disdain in New Orleans that fans are using words like “boycott” and saying they hope they can help hold the Super Bowl ratings down to a record low. But even mass participation is unlikely to make a decisive impact: The New Orleans area has a population of a little over a million, and the Super Bowl regularly draws more than 50 million.O.K., it’s overstating it a little to say Los Angeles isn’t excited about going to the Super Bowl. After all, thousands of fans waited in long lines this week for a pregame rally.But while other cities virtually stop when their team makes the big game, Los Angeles has reacted with a comparative shrug.After only three seasons back in town, the Rams haven’t sunk into the city’s bones the way, say, the Packers and the Steelers have in their football-mad hometowns.And, hey, LeBron James just came back to the Lakers after missing five weeks with an injury.The Los Angeles area, home to roughly 13 million people, has 11 major professional sports teams and prominent college programs. Many residents came from somewhere else, and brought their allegiances, perhaps even to the Patriots, with them.Some fans chose other teams during the two decades the N.F.L. was absent from Los Angeles. As Philip Nowlen told The New York Times’s California Today newsletter, “The years without a team led me to fan commitments to the 49ers and the Pats. Maybe after time passes … maybe.”While the Rams drew a robust 72,000 fans a game this season, playing in the cavernous Coliseum meant they were  at 77 percent of capacity, 31st of the 32 teams in the N.F.L.Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald got some attention this week by proclaiming that L.A. is “a football town now.” But his avowal is less interesting than the fact that he was asked about it at all. No one asked Tom Brady if Boston planned to follow this year’s Super Bowl.It hasn’t even been two years since the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead over the Patriots and transformed a third-quarter Super Bowl score into a lasting slur.So perhaps Atlanta can be forgiven if it is greeting anything about any Super Bowl — especially a Patriots-involved Super Bowl — with only so much good cheer.Yes, downtown and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are glimmering under a global spotlight, and the city, rightly proud of its hospitality tradition, is eager to show it can be the flawless host of a Super Bowl it worked so hard to earn. Mercedes-Benz Stadium, just two seasons old and already a crown jewel of Southern sports, will be on display for all to see.“Everything I’ve been getting so far is superpositive,” said Jessie Tuggle, the beloved linebacker who played his entire professional career for the Falcons and retired after the 2000 season. “I think people like being around people, and there are so many people around. They just love the N.F.L. experience.”And yet. Cue a new round of gripes over traffic. Trigger even more critiques of the Falcons’ middling performances of late, and wonder how so many Super Bowl events seem so out of reach for so many football fans. Stir the complaints over the halftime show, and how and why Maroon 5 landed the biggest gig in a city with one of the country’s richest music scenes.It is even a moment when Atlanta’s prized export, Coca-Cola, is a target for trolling by Pepsi, a major N.F.L. sponsor that has made no secret of its pleasure over a big week in one particular city. (“Look who’s in town for Super Bowl LIII,” read one Pepsi advertisement outside a Coke-sponsored shrine to Coke.)But even with all of that — the Pepsi flowing, the traffic slowing, the Falcons sputtering, Maroon 5 just being Maroon 5 — hey, at least the Saints aren’t playing.

"For Odell Beckham Jr., a Departure as Stunning as His Catches - The New York Times
On Nov. 23, 2014, in a nationally televised Sunday night game against the Dallas Cowboys, Odell Beckham Jr., then a Giants rookie, leapt high in the end zone, twisted as he arched backward, fought off a defender and made a fingertip, one-handed touchdown grab that seemed unfathomable even in slow motion replay.The next day, Beckham’s acrobatics had physicists, mechanical engineers and sports scientists scratching their heads.“It was a bit like Spider-Man,” said Jim Gates, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland. “A near superhuman activity.”In that moment — in just the seventh game of a nascent pro career — Beckham’s place in N.F.L. lore was cemented.Within months, he had won the league’s Offensive Rookie of the Year award, played in the Pro Bowl and became the youngest player ever to grace the cover of the omnipresent Madden N.F.L. video game. Beckham’s No. 13 jersey quickly became the hottest-selling football apparel nationwide. He was the new face of the storied Giants franchise.It is hard to believe that a little more than four years later, Beckham has been brusquely jettisoned from the team. On Tuesday, the popular, if sometimes mercurial, Beckham was traded to the Cleveland Browns for Jabrill Peppers, a safety with a modest record of N.F.L. achievement, and two draft picks (the 17th and 95th of next month’s draft) that, while valuable, are not likely to yield a star of Beckham’s magnitude.Beckham’s mystifying departure may be a window into a new N.F.L., in which players and teams can transition from seemingly amicable partners — Beckham signed a five-year, $90 million  contract extension with the Giants about six months ago — to rivals on opposing sidelines faster than ever before.Star players were once bound to teams for many years because restrictive guidelines made unfettered free agency hard to achieve. There is more movement in the modern N.F.L., and even Beckham’s contract, which at the time made him the highest-paid wide receiver in football, did not mean that the Giants wanted him around for long. Still, Beckham’s trade did not happen in a vacuum. In the last week, Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell, whose offensive production in Pittsburgh made them prospective Hall of Fame players, moved on from the Steelers.Beckham, 26, surely played a role in his exit. He embarrassed himself and the team with his mano-a-mano slugfest with Josh Norman, which contributed to a 2015 Giants loss. His end zone celebrations could be profane, and his antics on the sideline self-aggrandizing. As the leader of an ill-advised, overnight Florida boating trip when the team was preparing for a rare playoff game — followed by an inferior performance in a loss at Green Bay — he continued to demonstrate a level of immaturity.A television interview last fall in which Beckham did not show support for quarterback Eli Manning and seemed to question his teammates’ effort produced more hand-wringing in the Giants offices at the highest levels, including ownership. A portion of the Giants fandom also began to sour on Beckham because of his volatility.In today’s N.F.L., some teams choose to abandon their hefty investments in players who are distractions rather than wait for those players to become such problems that they must be moved. Or team executives ditch the player before he tries to force a trade, as Brown did, and in that way maintain their trading leverage.The real surprise in the Beckham case is that it was the staid Giants who chose to push their most talented and popular player out the door — and to do it in his prime. The Giants are historically much more conscious and concerned about fan reaction to their transactions. But not in this situation. Beckham was dispensable, even if it meant that the tens of thousands of Giants fans with one of Beckham’s replica jerseys hanging in a closet — many of them prized fans under the age of 35 — were thunderstruck by Tuesday’s deal.The Giants fan base is already reeling, and not just because its team has had one winning season since 2012. Beckham’s trade is just one of several recent purges of the team’s roster that have left many fans confounded and angry. There are, for example, only three players remaining from the team’s Week 1 starting lineup in 2016.Moreover, if there is a clear path that the Giants are following, indeed if there is a plan at all, it’s not easily deciphered.Yes, the Giants are in a rebuilding mode. But they will have to rebuild with financial constraints. About $16 million of Beckham’s salary will count against the Giants’ 2019 cap, and more startling, that’s less than half of the $32.5 million on this year’s salary cap ledger for players who are not here anymore: The Giants also recently traded or cut players like cornerback Eli Apple, defensive end Olivier Vernon, defensive tackle Damon Harrison and offensive lineman Patrick Omameh.And Manning is due about $23 million next season. That total could be reduced if Manning is cut in a few days, before his bonus is due. If that happens, it may provide some clarity on the front office’s apparent overall strategy of tearing down everything to start over. But losing Manning on top of Beckham may leave some Giants loyalists apoplectic. If not catatonic.In the end, Beckham’s exit underscores another relevant pattern: Every Giants first-round draft choice from 2013 to 2016 has either been traded or released by the team. Of the 70 players the Giants selected from 2008 to 2017, only six remain.More than any other factor, that is why the Giants have lost 24 of their last 32 games and have not won a playoff game in seven years. With his magical pass-catching skills, Beckham was once seen as a Giants savior. The team and its fans now have to find a new one."
"N.F.L. Players Union Says Retiree Benefits Are a Priority - The New York Times
ATLANTA — The executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association, DeMaurice Smith, said Thursday that the union would push for more generous benefits for all retired players in the coming negotiations over the collective bargaining agreement, which expires after the 2020 season.The union has been criticized for not doing enough to improve the pensions and health insurance for older retired players. Eric Dickerson and a group of other former stars sent a letter to Smith, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, and David Baker, the president of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, saying they would not attend the annual induction ceremony until all members of the Hall of Fame receive health insurance and a salary.In September, another group of prominent former players formed a nonprofit group called Fairness for Athletes in Retirement, or FAIR, that has a single goal: to gain pensions equivalent to those of players who retired after 1993. Before 1993, pension contributions were far less than for players who retired after that year.Smith said that helping retired players had always been a priority, noting that in 2011, the league and the union established the Legacy Fund, which provided $620 million to improve the pensions of players who retired before 1993.“We have always reached back and improved pensions,” he said. “I think it’s smart that former players understand that we can accomplish more in improving benefits. This is a union that is never going to select a certain group of players over another group of players.”Dewey McClain, a former player and an executive committee member at the Players Association, added, “There are roughly 25,000 former players, and we need to take care of all of them.”Improving retiree benefits will be one of many issues facing the union as it braces for negotiations to renew its labor deal. During the last negotiation, in 2011, the owners locked out the players, and the work stoppage lasted about four months.The union has been diverting royalties from its deal with Electronic Arts, the maker of the “Madden NFL” series of video games, into a fund to be used in case of another lockout. Smith declined to say whether the union would sue the league if it diverted money from its media contracts into its own fund, a step the union took in 2011. But he did say negotiations were not a pretty process.“It is one of the messiest, nastiest things you could ever do,” he said.The union wants to increase the share of players contracts that are guaranteed, but Smith said that was not necessarily something that could be achieved through the coming negotiations. Rather, it could be gained more quickly by players demanding it in contract negotiations.The union’s executive members were encouraged that Kirk Cousins, a quarterback on the Minnesota Vikings, was able to sign a fully guaranteed, three-year $84 million contract last off-season.“Would we love guaranteed contracts? Yes,” said Mark Herzlich, a member of the executive committee. “Is it something we will ask for? Yes. Is it the sole thing we will ask for? No.”"
"Chargers’ Defense Stifles Ravens in Wild-Card Playoff Win - The New York Times
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Ravens’ startling charge into the playoffs was spurred by something perhaps even more surprising: a radical, run-first style of offense led by the rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson.Baltimore’s unconventional style of attack in the midst of a pass-happy N.F.L. era rescued the Ravens, who won six of their final seven regular-season games. And the most impressive victory in that stretch was a 12-point romp over the Chargers in Los Angeles in Week 16.In the end, however, the defeat of the Chargers was the Ravens’ undoing in their rematch here Sunday in an A.F.C. wild-card playoff game.In the week leading up to Sunday’s contest, the Chargers dissected the videotape of the Ravens’ Dec. 22 triumph in Los Angeles until every play and, more important, the alignments before every play were committed to memory. The Chargers’ defensive coaches schooled the players on every Ravens tendency and tried a daring lineup that included seven defensive backs instead of the usual four or five.The study and the strategy worked. Until a late rally in the final minutes, Baltimore’s new-look offense had just 3 points and three first downs. Jackson was challenged and confounded into a dreadful performance as Los Angeles built a commanding lead and held on to upset the Ravens, 23-17.“We had better reads on their formations, and we saw things coming,” Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa said in the winning locker room. “It really was kind of a blessing to have played them and seen them just a few weeks ago.”The Chargers’ defensive approach forced Jackson into three fumbles — one of which he lost — and an interception. He was sacked seven times.“You could see we were frustrating them,” Los Angeles cornerback Casey Hayward Jr. said. “They were confused. What had been working for them was not working.”Or, as Chargers Coach Anthony Lynn said when asked if the Ravens had appeared flustered: “If you’re used to running the ball for 300 yards and you get only 80, yeah, you get flustered.”Los Angeles, which has won its last seven road games, will travel to New England to face the Patriots in a divisional-round game Sunday at 1 p.m.For the Chargers, the rare alignment of seven defensive backs, which replaced bulky linebackers with smaller, fleet defenders, was a risk. But it was intended to thwart Jackson’s advanced rushing skills.“Lamar is so fast, we wanted our fastest guys defending him, even if it meant smaller guys,” Lynn said. “We didn’t know if it would work, but we wanted to take a look at it.“We were definitely ready to move onto a different defensive grouping if it didn’t work. But it did.”Indeed, it was effective immediately and set the tone for the game. On the first play from scrimmage, Jackson kept the football and tried to dash around right end. He was tackled for a 1-yard loss by safety Derwin James.Recalling the play, Lynn smiled broadly.“The first time we played them, we played their game,” he said. “Today, we played our game.”For the Ravens, the loss brought a sudden end to a season marked by drastic change. The longtime Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was overtaken by Jackson, who remains the franchise’s top quarterback moving forward. John Harbaugh, whose job as Baltimore’s head coach had seemed in jeopardy until the late surge by the Ravens, still may not remain.Flacco did not comment on his future Sunday, although he insisted that he did not think he should have replaced Jackson as the Ravens fell behind Los Angeles by 17 points. Harbaugh also declined to discuss his own future in detail.“No one can say what tomorrow is going to bring,” Harbaugh said. “We’ll see. I have every expectation to be here as long as they want me here.”The victory was also a subtle but authoritative accomplishment by the veteran Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, who was appearing in his 10th postseason game. Rivers, who completed 22 of 32 passes, coolly and carefully led the Los Angeles offense on six scoring drives against the N.F.L.’s top-ranked defense.Rivers did not throw an interception and was sacked just once. And while the Chargers lost one fumble, they were otherwise judicious with the football and exhibited the kind of ball-control offense that had been Baltimore’s bread and butter in its charge to the playoffs.Advancing cautiously for most of the game, Los Angeles kicked four field goals to take a 12-0 halftime lead. In the third quarter, a Chargers turnover and a blocked punt by the Ravens gave Baltimore a brief surge of momentum. But the Ravens could turn the miscues into only 3 points when a fumble recovery by C. J. Mosley led to a 33-yard Justin Tucker field goal. After the Ravens’ Buck Allen partially blocked a punt and gave Baltimore good field position, the possession led only to a 50-yard field-goal attempt that Tucker missed.On the ensuing Chargers possession, a 28-yard pass from Rivers to Mike Williams, followed by a 14-yard run by Melvin Gordon, set up a third down from the Ravens’ 1-yard line. Gordon was tripped and fell just before the goal line; the play was ruled a touchdown until it was overturned by video replay.On the subsequent fourth-down play, Gordon bulled into the end zone. The Chargers completed a 2-point conversion to extend their lead to 20-3.At this point, fans at M&T Bank Stadium began chanting Flacco’s name. Jackson remained in the game, but his presence elicited a chorus of boos from the crowd. That displeasure intensified when Jackson was twice sacked on a three-and-out series.But on the next series, Jackson awakened and tossed a 31-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree with 6 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. On the Ravens’ next possession, Jackson connected with Crabtree again, throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass that cut the Chargers’ lead to 23-17 with 1:59 left.The Ravens did get the football for a final series, but their comeback ended when Jackson was stripped of the football as he was preparing to pass. The fumble was recovered by the Chargers’ Melvin Ingram, who dominated the Ravens’ offensive line throughout Sunday’s game. Ingram had seven tackles and two sacks.“This was and was not a typical game for us,” Rivers said afterward. “Because we’ve had all kinds of victories — ugly ones, pretty ones, good games offensively and good games defensively. That’s just us. But mostly, I think we’re a pretty good team.”"
"The Jets and the Gregg Williams Gamble - The New York Times
After a 4-12 season, the Jets were expected to overhaul their staff. But few expected the team to land perhaps the most controversial figure in the N.F.L. coaching ranks.Enter Gregg Williams, the Jets’ new defensive coordinator, whose credentials include a Super Bowl ring with the New Orleans Saints in 2009; a surprisingly positive run as the interim coach of the Cleveland Browns this season; and, not to be forgotten, a role as the face of one of the ugliest scandals to tarnish the image of the N.F.L. in the last decade.For the Jets, mired in one of their trademark periods of borderline irrelevance, he has been brought in to reform an undisciplined defense and counterbalance Adam Gase, the newly hired coach, who at 40 is one of the league’s youngest, most innovative offensive minds.Williams’s reputation as a firebrand, however, carries significant risks for a franchise frequently plagued by off-field distraction.Williams was at the heart of the scandal known as Bountygate, in which the Saints, with Williams as ringleader, offered payouts to players who injured opponents, according to a league investigation. The scandal resulted in plenty of hand-wringing over the sport’s relationship with brutality when it was trying to convince the public that it was taking seriously the mounting concerns about head injuries.In March 2012, Williams received an indefinite suspension, the harshest of the penalties doled out, which included a one-year suspension for Saints Coach Sean Payton. Williams was reinstated in 2013.In the years since, Williams, 60, has worked his way back into the defensive coordinator role seemingly without having lost much of his brashness or bravado. On HBO’s “Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Cleveland Browns” this past summer, Williams became something of a celebrity among Browns supporters, who took to his intensity and vulgar tirades. Williams liked to end defensive huddles with the phrase, “Come get some.”“He’s not here to make you feel comfortable,” said the former linebacker Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who played for Williams in New Orleans and St. Louis. “He’s willing to ruffle your feathers.”Williams is indeed a throwback to the era of football coach as force of nature. Gase’s introduction to the Jets was judged by some as notably subdued. But Williams thunders into a locker room like a gale.In Cleveland, where he was defensive coordinator for two seasons, he warned parents about bringing young children to training camp because of his propensity to yell obscenities. He admonished reporters for slouching in chairs. He trash-talked the matinee-idol quarterback Baker Mayfield.Dunbar said practices were intensified by Williams’s insistence that any loose ball be treated like a turnover, at all times.“Anytime a ball hits the ground, he wants you to pick it up,” Dunbar said. “Anytime a ball is overthrown, he wants you to act like it was an interception and return it.”Dunbar added that players eventually became “conditioned to go after the ball.”It strikes some as just the sort of Type A personality that can light a fire under the Jets, who struggled under Coach Todd Bowles.“They need a guy that can come and crack the whip — teach them football but also be very demanding,” said Bart Scott, a former Jets linebacker who is now a co-host of “The CMB Show” on WFAN. “He can teach them and give them the tools to be successful in different situations.”The Jets have declined to make Williams available for interviews until after Gase’s full staff has been assembled. Gase also hired Dowell Loggains from the Miami Dolphins to be offensive coordinator, and kept the special-teams coordinator Brant Boyer.In a recent interview on a Pro Football Talk podcast, Gase said he had known Williams for more than a decade.“He did his time,” Gase said of Williams and the scandal in New Orleans. “He’s gotten a second chance, he’s done it right, he’s gone and worked extremely hard to do things the right way, and for me or anybody else to hold that over his head, to me, is wrong.”Many Jets players expressed enthusiasm after Williams was hired. Safety Jamal Adams, at the Pro Bowl in Orlando, said he had already been watching videos of Williams’s teams on YouTube.“He’s the best in the business,” Adams said. “I’ve had so many players hit me up to tell me how much I’m going to love Coach Gregg.”One former player who may not share such sentiments is Peyton Manning, who recommended Gase, his former offensive coordinator in Denver, to the Jets. Williams once told a Nashville radio station that he wanted his defenders to put “remember me” hits on Manning, then the quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts.Williams will probably bring at least one significant change to the defensive scheme. The Jets have used a 3-4 (three down linemen, four linebackers) base defense since Eric Mangini arrived in 2006. But Williams is known for his 4-3 format, which emphasizes speed rushers on the outside, something the Jets do not exactly have right now.The team does have more than $100 million in cap space, so there should be flexibility to acquire a defensive end or two to fit Williams’s vision, which relies on the blitz.“They’re going to be probably the most aggressive defense in the N.F.L.,” Dunbar said. “He’s going to bring pressure. He’s going to manufacture pressure.”The Jets tried this approach under Rex Ryan, who took them to two consecutive A.F.C. championship games. It worked until it didn’t. Ryan coached the Jets for six years and was fired after the 2014 season, when he went too 4-12.Williams’s demanding personality will be an adjustment for some players. Dunbar said another difficulty is how much information he throws at his players so they understand more than just their role in the defense — he wants them to know the whole orchestra, not just its parts.“He wants his players to be more like coaches on the field than just robotic players,” Dunbar said. “He wants them to play with instinct and be able to call what they feel.”To Scott, that is the type of coach the Jets need, controversy aside.“He was the best hire available,” Scott said. “You have talented pieces. They just don’t know how to be great.”"
"Bob Kuechenberg, 71, Dies; Gritty Guard With Champion Dolphins - The New York Times
Bob Kuechenberg, a six-time Pro Bowl guard in the National Football League, two-time Super Bowl champion and member of the only N.F.L. team to achieve a perfect season, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, died on Saturday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 71.His former wife, Marilyn Nix Kuechenberg, said the cause was a heart attack.Kuechenberg joined the Dolphins as a free agent in 1970, the future Hall of Fame coach Don Shula’s first season, and played for them until 1983. He was part of a daunting offensive line that included guard Larry Little and center Jim Langer, both enshrined in the Hall of Fame.The New York Times sportswriter Red Smith quoted Kuechenberg in 1975 on his strategy for neutralizing defenders, in this case the Chicago Bears tackle Wally Chambers. “I just fight him,” Kuechenberg said. “As long as he’s beating on my head and not the quarterback’s, it’s all right with me.”Kuechenberg (pronounced KOOCH-en-berg) started every game for the 1972 Dolphins, who went 17-0, beating the Washington Redskins, 14-7, in Super Bowl VII at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He started 16 games during the 1973 season and playoffs when the Dolphins repeated as champions, blowing out the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7, in the Super Bowl at Rice Stadium in Houston.The Dolphins overcame the vaunted Vikings defense, known as the Purple People Eaters, on the ground — the Dolphins’ quarterback, Bob Griese, attempted only seven passes — in no small part because of Kuechenberg’s work up front against Alan Page, the Vikings’ Hall of Fame defensive tackle.In a statement after Kuechenberg’s death, Shula said his performance in Super Bowl VIII “was one of the keys to our victory.”Kuechenberg was tough, even for an N.F.L. offensive lineman. He played with a fractured forearm in the Dolphins’ second Super Bowl victory, completed a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers with a broken ankle and played much of the 1977 season with two fractured bones in his back.An eye injury ended Kuechenberg’s career after the 1983 season, during which he blocked for the rookie quarterback Dan Marino.Kuechenberg played in 196 games with Miami, a team record that was later broken by Marino.“He gave you everything he had every single snap, and that dependability extended throughout his career, missing only a few games during that time,” Shula said.Robert John Kuechenberg was born on Oct. 14, 1947, in Gary, Ind., to Rudy and Marion Kuechenberg. He told The Palm Beach Post in 2005 that his father had been an iron worker, middleweight boxer, rodeo clown and human cannonball.He grew up in Hobart, Ind., and graduated from Hobart High School in 1965 before studying economics and playing football at the University of Notre Dame.Kuechenberg told The Palm Beach Post that his father (“the toughest guy I have ever known”) had motivated him to play through pain.“I’m the only one that I know of who made it in the N.F.L. whose father accused me of being a pussycat for taking the easy way out,” Kuechenberg said, referring to his college education and football career. “He basically said, ‘Either graduate from Notre Dame or get in the cannon.’”“So a broken arm? That’s no big deal.”He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1969 and was chosen by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the N.F.L. draft. But he was released by the Eagles and then the Atlanta Falcons in his first season, which he finished with the Chicago Owls of the Continental Football League before joining the Dolphins.He married his high school sweetheart while he was at Notre Dame. They later divorced.After retiring from the N.F.L., Kuechenberg ran fine arts and luxury real estate businesses. He also renovated houses in Florida with Ms. Nix Kuechenberg, whom he married in the early 1970s; one restoration was of a historic multimillion-dollar mansion on Star Island in Miami Beach. That marriage ended in divorce, as did his two subsequent ones.His survivors include two children from his first marriage, Bryan and Eric; two from his second marriage, Nicholas and Alexandra Kuechenberg; one from his third marriage, Brandon; two grandchildren; and six siblings.Kuechenberg was a repeat finalist for the Hall of Fame, in Canton, Ohio, but has not been elected to it.“I’ve coached a lot of Hall of Fame players, including a number of offensive linemen, and Kooch was as good as any of them,” Shula said. “I hope one day he gets that ultimate recognition by being enshrined in Canton. It’s an honor long overdue.”"
"Opinion | The Meaning of Tony Romo, Super Bowl Psychic - The New York Times
The Super Bowl arrives and, with it, so many questions big and small. Is Tom Brady part cyborg and maybe even immortal? Will the Los Angeles Rams be hamstrung by the knowledge that they got this far by the grace of several sleepwalking referees?How frequently will Tony Romo see the future? And might our fascination with that speak to a longing that reaches far beyond football?But first a quick primer on Romo, CBS’s dependably psychic commentator. Over the course of two seasons analyzing National Football League games from the broadcast booth, he has provided more than the usual blather and banter. He guesses what will happen next: blitz or no blitz, run or pass, involving this wide receiver or that tight end. He doesn’t do this for every play, but he does it repeatedly. And if he were picking stocks on Wall Street, he’d be a gazillionaire.Romo hit peak prognostication when he announced the game two weeks ago in which Brady and the New England Patriots eked past the Kansas City Chiefs, earning yet another trip to the Super Bowl. He made 15 specific forecasts. Thirteen were correct. On the two occasions when the team on offense bucked Romo’s soothsaying, “the results were poor — one play ended with an incomplete pass, and the other with a turnover,” noted Zach Helfand in The New Yorker. “It seemed that, even when Romo was wrong, he was right.”Romo, 38, previously spent more than a decade as a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. He was great but he wasn’t great, and with him as its leader, the team never went all the way. In a twist that’s testament to second acts in American lives, he’s doing something as a star for CBS that he never did as a star for the Cowboys: going to the Super Bowl. I suppose that’s fitting, because he’s more than great in his current gig. He’s peerless. And he’s a sensation.So much so that after the Patriots-Chiefs game, reporters for The Wall Street Journal studied 46 hours of television footage from this past football season to review the 2,599 plays that Romo had provided live commentary for. Not even the Nixon Tapes got scrutiny like that. The Journal found 72 instances when Romo prophesied what a team was about to do. The team did what he said 68 percent of the time.“A broadcasting phenomenon” is how The Journal describes Romo. Twitter calls him Romostradamus. Football fans gush about Romomania. And this is obviously about more than the novelty of his crystal ball.It’s about the rarity of his unquestionably deep knowledge in an era when so many of the people who put on the trappings of authority and peddle pearls of wisdom don’t actually have the goods. When so many opinions come with a swagger inversely proportional to their worth. When social media, cable channels, webcasts, podcasts, blogs and more have created an environment in which everybody’s an expert and nobody’s an expert — in which it’s sometimes impossible to tell.With Romo you can tell. His verified foresight proves his genuine insight.As I’ve savored his genius and reflected on its appeal, I’ve flashed back to some comments that President Obama made to The New Yorker’s top editor, David Remnick, for a lengthy article in late November 2016 about his waning days in office. Obama was obsessed with the chaotic nature of this new information ecosystem. “Everything is true and nothing is true,” he told Remnick. “An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers’ payroll.”I also flashed back to another article, by Amy Zegart, that appeared in The Atlantic the following summer. It defined the “three paradoxes disrupting American politics,” the first of which was “more information, less credibility.”“The volume of data is exploding, and yet credible information is harder to find,” Zegart wrote. “Why? Because the barriers to entry are so low.” You don’t need a printing press, a book contract or the approval of some gatekeeper to have your say and share your thoughts. You just need an internet connection. And while there’s obvious benefit to that — judgment and permission aren’t the exclusive province of a discriminatory elite — there’s obvious danger, too. Good filters disappear with the bad ones. Cyberspace is at once a smorgasbord and a junkyard.Romo’s habitat — network television — is old-fashioned, but that’s not what distinguishes and recommends him. His seriousness sets him apart. I don’t mean his style, which Helfand likened to “that of a 10-year-old who’s really into dinosaurs showing his uncle the T. rex exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History.” I mean his content. He played football recently and has studied it closely, so he understands what the athletes are thinking, what the coaches are plotting, what makes sense on third down and what doesn’t. He uses the days between the games that he’s announcing to bone up on the teams that will come under his gaze, even interviewing their members. While he comes by his charisma naturally, he makes it a point to be informed.How refreshing, and what an excellent reminder he is that hugely successful athletes aren’t just physically gifted; they’re mentally tough, and many are smart. Their sports pivot on intricate strategy as much as brute strength. To the agile thinkers go the spoils. Ever listened to one of those LeBron James news conferences right after a basketball game? He remembers and can deconstruct every second of it. It’s all there in his brain.Romo found glory aplenty on the football field, but he began to find even greater glory the minute he stepped off it in late 2016, with a farewell speech that was like the climactic monologue in one of those sports movies that has grown men working every last muscle and tendon in their faces not to cry.“I just want to leave you with something I’ve learned in this process,” he said, referring to his quarterbacking years. “I feel like we all have two battles or two enemies going on. One with the man across from you. The second is with the man inside of you. I think once you control the one inside of you, the one across from you really doesn’t matter.”Emotional intelligence along with clairvoyance: That’s no everyday combination. But then he’s no everyday oracle. You can tune in to the Super Bowl to marvel at Brady, chuckle over the commercials and gripe about the halftime show. Or you can come for Romo. He alone is lure enough. "

"How Offense Took Over the N.F.L.  - The New York Times
The 1,371 touchdowns scored in the 2018 N.F.L. regular season were the most for a single season in the 99-year history of the league. Quarterbacks threw more touchdown passes than ever. For the first time, both teams in a regulation game scored 50 or more points. Dozens of individual and team offensive records fell as players raced up and down the field, apparently to the delight of fans, because the N.F.L.’s television ratings spiked substantially.Fittingly, and not surprisingly, the four teams that remain in the hunt for a berth in the Super Bowl — the New Orleans Saints, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots — scored the most points this season.But the recent offensive explosion in the N.F.L. didn’t just happen in the past year, nor did productive, pass-happy, fast-paced offensive schemes materialize in a vacuum. Instead, for roughly four decades (or the life span of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady), a series of innovations, minirevolutions, bold strategies from pioneering coaches and the purposeful rule changes by the N.F.L. led to the unprecedented 2018 season.And it was on this path that the four starting quarterbacks in Sunday’s conference championships games — two in their 40s and two in their early 20s — were also shaped.Here is a timeline of how the N.F.L. dragged itself from its low-scoring past to one of its wildest seasons ever.The N. F. L. makes it illegal for defenders to make significant contact with a wide receiver once he is more than 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The league also loosens its restrictions on offensive linemen, allowing blockers to extend their arms and open their hands while protecting the quarterback on pass plays.Capitalizing on the new rules, Don Coryell, in his first year coaching the San Diego Chargers, installs a downfield-pass-oriented offense that spawns disciples for years to come. The offense, known as Air Coryell and helmed by quarterback Dan Fouts, now a Hall of Famer, leads the N.F.L. in passing from 1978 to 1983.The new rules enacted in 1978 have a vast effect. In 1980, teams pass the football 47 percent of the time, compared with just 38 percent in 1977. The number of points scored per game jumps to 41, from 34.4 in 1977.Behind the innovative short-passing  scheme of Coach Bill Walsh, the San Francisco 49ers win their first Super Bowl. Walsh’s complex, horizontal offense relies on multiple wideout sets and ever-changing backfield formations. Called the West Coast offense, Walsh’s system is copied leaguewide after the 49ers win the Super Bowl two more times in the 1980s.Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche institutes a radical no-huddle offense, and his Super Bowl-bound Bengals lead the N.F.L. in points, yards gained, first downs and yards per passing attempt. Before each snap, quarterback Boomer Esiason, the league most valuable player, reads the defense and alters the play call, presaging the elaborate presnap adjustments made by Peyton Manning and Brady years later.The University of Houston brings the run-and-shoot offense into the football mainstream. The pass-first scheme, popularized by Mouse Davis at Portland State in the late 1970s, is predicated on the quarterback and his four receivers reading and reacting to coverages. The Cougars set 26 N.C.A.A. records, and Andre Ware becomes the first black quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy, throwing for 4,699 yards and 44 touchdowns.Buffalo unveils its famed K-Gun offense in a 30-23 victory against Philadelphia. Operating out of the shotgun, quarterback Jim Kelly calls plays without huddling, spreading the ball in three-receiver sets. Behind its electrifying offense, Buffalo advances to its first of four consecutive Super Bowls.The N.F.L. renews its emphasis on prohibiting defensive backs from jamming receivers more than 5 yards downfield, and passing statistics climb.In his senior year, Brees leads Purdue to last-minute upsets over Ohio State and Michigan, helping the Boilermakers clinch their first Big Ten title in more than 30 years. Brees, who threw for 3,668 yards with 36 touchdowns and just 12 interceptions, sets two N.C.A.A. records, 13 Big Ten records and 19 Purdue records. But because he operated a spread offense, his passing statistics are devalued by N.F.L. analysts, who remain uncertain of his pro potential. Brees’s height (6 feet) is also expected to hurt his prospects.In the fourth quarter of New England’s 10-3 loss to the Jets, linebacker Mo Lewis levels Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe near the sideline, knocking him out of the game with a sheared blood vessel in his chest. Bledsoe plays one more series before being replaced by Brady. Bledsoe never regains his starting job for New England.Five months after replacing Bledsoe, Brady wins his first Super Bowl, 20-17, over the favored St. Louis Rams, whose league-leading offense was called The Greatest Show on Turf. New England advances to the Super Bowl after winning, 24-14, in Indianapolis in a game with leaguewide ramifications. After the Patriots followed Coach Bill Belichick’s orders to hit Colts receivers hard every chance they could, the N.F.L. responds by having officials emphasize defensive holding and illegal-contact calls, forcing defenders to be cautious about touching receivers beyond 5 yards.Texas Tech’s Air Raid offense system, developed by Coach Mike Leach, gains renown when the Red Raiders score 70 points in victories over Nebraska and Texas Christian. Texas Tech’s Kliff Kingsbury becomes the third college quarterback to throw for 10,000 yards. Part of the ingenuity of the Air Raid offense is its simplicity (there are eight basic plays) and its sophistication (there are countless outcomes based on options that stress ball distribution, spacing and tempo).In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which forces the Saints to spend the 2005 season on the road, the franchise regroups by hiring Sean Payton as coach and, two months later, signing Brees, a free agent, to a six-year contract. Payton, an aggressive play-caller, and Brees, the most accurate quarterback in N.F.L. history, embark on a fruitful partnership. It produces a Super Bowl title three years later, 118 regular-season victories (second among quarterback-coach combinations to Belichick and Brady in the Super Bowl era) and a template, 11 years later, for a young coach and his quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams to follow.On the Patriots’ 15th offensive snap of the season, Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard lunges at Brady as he releases a pass, causing the quarterback’s left leg to bend awkwardly. The unpenalized hit leaves Brady with two torn knee ligaments. After the season, the N.F.L. adjusts more rules, accelerating the passing explosion. The league bars defenders on the ground from lunging at a quarterback’s lower legs and agrees to assess a 15-yard penalty for hitting defenseless receivers in the head, a move that further allows them to catch the ball over the middle without fear.Brees sets a season record with 5,476 passing yards, and Brady surpasses 5,000 for the first time. Brady develops a strong on-field rapport with Rob Gronkowski, who in his second season epitomizes the new breed of tight ends,  who create unsolvable matchup problems with speed and size. Travis Kelce of the Chiefs is another such tight end. Reid, who had developed a reputation as a quarterback whisperer, is named head coach in Kansas City. He was an offensive assistant  in Green Bay in the 1990s, when Brett Favre led the Packers to two Super Bowls and won three league M.V.P. awards. By 1999, Reid was coach in Philadelphia, where he promptly drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb, who led the Eagles to five N.F.C. championship games. Four years after joining the Chiefs, Reid is instrumental in the team’s decision to focus much of their predraft attention on Mahomes.Goff enrolls at California to play for  Coach Sonny Dykes, who assisted Leach at Texas Tech, where Dykes coached Welker. Running the Bear Raid — Cal’s version of the Air Raid — Goff, as a true freshman, sets several program passing records.At Whitehouse High School in Texas, Mahomes passes for 3,587 yards with 41 touchdowns and four interceptions while running the Air Raid offense. Mahomes throws for 597 yards in his final game before heading to Texas Tech to play in the Air Raid system once again.Five months before Manning breaks the season record for touchdown passes (55) and passing yards (5,477), the N.F.L. draft indicates where the league is trending. For the first time since 1963, no running back is taken in the first round. It happens again in 2014.In what may have been a response to how Seattle’s defensive backs stifled Manning’s Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl, the N.F.L. emphasizes enforcing illegal-contact rules in the secondary for the first time in seven years. As a result, illegal-contact penalties soar, to an average of 3.31 per team from 1.19 in 2013, according to  nflpenalties.com. Defensive-holding penalties also increase, to an average of 7.34 per team from 5.66. Offenses capitalize on the new rules, throwing more touchdown passes (804) and completing a greater percentage of passes (62.6) than ever before.The Rams, seeking to better develop Goff, hire Sean McVay as coach. At 30 years 11 months 19 days, McVay becomes the youngest coach in the N.F.L.’s modern era.Brady wins his fifth Super Bowl, as the Patriots overcome a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons. He completes 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earns him Super Bowl M.V.P. honors for the fourth time.Under McVay’s tutelage, Goff blossoms, completing 62.1 percent of his passes for 3,804 yards and 28 touchdowns, as the Rams morph from the lowest-scoring team in the N.F.L. to the highest. McVay’s offense, heavy on play-action and screens and condensed alignments for receivers, is built for misdirection. His preferred personnel grouping — three receivers, one running back, one tight end — rarely deviates, but McVay confuses opponents by changing tempos, alignments and motions. Many of the Rams’ passing plays resemble runs, and vice versa. The Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 Super Bowl victory over New England is an inflection point in the offensive revolution. It features the most combined yards in an N.F.L. game (1,151), and Brady throws for a Super Bowl-record 505 yards. The signature moment — a trick play called Philly Special — reinforces the appreciation of coaches’ ingenuity at the lower levels. The Eagles plucked the play from the 2016 Chicago Bears, but, according to The MMQB, it originated at a South Carolina high school in 2011 and had also been run by, among others, Clemson and Westlake High School in Austin, Tex. — the alma mater of Drew Brees and Eagles quarterback Nick Foles.The N.F.L.’s latest attempts to regulate safety have an intended consequence of protecting its most valuable assets, its quarterbacks, and serve as prelude to a record-shattering season. The rule changes generate celebration from offensive players and fury from defenders, who are barred from initiating contact with their helmets by lowering their heads. The league emphasizes to officials that defenders cannot use their body weight to land on the quarterback as they are bringing him to the ground — or, well, ever, really. It also clarifies what constitutes a catch, acknowledging that players do not have to control the ball to the ground.The aerial explosion enveloping the N.F.L. sends teams scurrying for coaches who can mold desultory offenses into the next Chiefs, Patriots, Rams or Saints. Coaches, in other words, like McVay. Eight jobs open, and of the six hires that have been announced, five have offensive backgrounds, including Green Bay’s Matt LaFleur, who spent the 2017 season as McVay’s offensive coordinator, and Arizona’s Kingsbury, who developed Mahomes at Texas Tech. The Cincinnati Bengals are expected to hire Zac Taylor, Goff’s quarterback coach, after the Rams’ season ends. "
"Foxboro(ugh!): Where Visiting N.F.L. Teams Hate to Play - The New York Times
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — In the N.F.L. community, one word might be feared more than any other: Foxborough.It is where the rosy Super Bowl dreams of visiting teams die a frosty death each January. It is where the New England Patriots, before a raucous southeastern Massachusetts home crowd, rarely lose a playoff game (this century’s postseason record there is 19-3). It is where N.F.L. road teams are not only defeated, but rejected under peculiar circumstances. See: Deflategate, Tom Brady and the tuck rule.How did out-of-the way, small-town Foxborough, of all places, come to be synonymous with heartache in N.F.L. cities from coast to coast while blossoming into a shrine to comprehensive Patriots glory?The Patriots, after all, came to Foxborough in 1971 only because no one else wanted them. It helped that the stadium land, 30 miles south of Boston, was free.[N.F.L. Playoff Coverage: Patriots Dominate Chargers to Reach A.F.C. Championship Game] Foxborough (population: 17,000) remains firmly rooted in its pre-Patriots past, with dairy cows visible from the top of Gillette Stadium. More than that, Foxborough is the oddest place to bear witness to recurring N.F.L. history, simply because no one here can agree on how to spell the town’s name.Since 1778, by decree, in all authorized documents and on all town buildings, it has been spelled Foxborough. But almost immediately after that became official, many institutions in the town — banks, businesses, even the local newspaper — decided it was easier to go by Foxboro. In a quintessential example of New England persistence, the argument has endured for centuries: There are now signs with both spellings throughout the village.However the name is spelled, Foxborough residents know their little municipality is renowned far and wide.“I’ve done training across the country,” Tom Buckley, the town’s deputy fire chief, said. “When I’m asked where I live, I never mention the Patriots. I just say Foxborough. And instantly, everyone starts talking to me about the Patriots and how they always win there.“Does that happen with any other N.F.L. team? I mean, I don’t know where the Miami Dolphins play, even though I know it’s not Miami.” The Patriots, unbeaten in their last eight home playoff games, will put that streak on the line Sunday afternoon against the Los Angeles Chargers in an A.F.C. divisional playoff game. The Patriots, who have won five Super Bowls since the 2001 season, have had, for them, an uneven season, losing five of eight away games. But they were the only N.F.L. team to be 8-0 at home, a substantial source of pride in Foxborough.“In the town, we feel like we bring a different type of energy at those home games,” David Tynan, a longtime Foxborough resident, said on Wednesday outside the town’s primary grocery store. “Game days are like holidays. By kickoff, the streets are quiet — you’re either at the stadium or inside watching the game.”Because there are few hills, trees or other buildings near Gillette Stadium, the landscape is windswept in January and bracing, with temperatures typically in the 20s. The Patriots intentionally built their practice facility adjacent to the stadium, and they almost always practice outside,  acclimating to the elements in a way that their playoff opponents — from mostly warmer regions — cannot. The atmosphere in Gillette Stadium is also especially hostile to visiting teams, as Patriots home crowds are considered among the most vociferous in the N.F.L.Rich Noonan, a lieutenant in the Police Department and a fifth-generation native of Foxborough, recalled the town’s blue-collar origins and said area fans “were protecting their home turf.”Noonan laughed, and added: “But so much has changed. When I was a kid, they couldn’t give away tickets. They opened the stadium gates at halftime and let anyone in.”Indeed, the Patriots’ earliest days in Foxborough were as undistinguished as their first 11 years as the vagabond Boston Patriots of the American Football League. Beginning in 1960, those unheralded Patriots practiced on grassless high school fields and played games at Boston University, Harvard University, Boston College and Fenway Park. With the A.F.L.-N.F.L. merger in 1970, the Patriots needed a sizable stadium as a permanent home, and after talks with Boston city leaders repeatedly broke down, Billy Sullivan, the team’s owner, welcomed an offer from Bay State Raceway, which donated land next to its facility for a 60,000-seat stadium.The Patriots won their first game at the stadium in 1971, although thousands of ticket holders never saw a single play because they were stuck for the entirety of the game in gridlock traffic that crammed Route 1, the only access road to the stadium.Shortly after the first game, the local health board closed Schaefer Stadium because of malfunctioning toilets. Various solutions were tried, including an exercise that enlisted hundreds of volunteers to flush all of the stadium toilets simultaneously — a tactic referred to as Super Flush in the local news media. Fans came up with another name for the site: the Toilet Bowl.“It was a nightmare at times,” Jack Authelet, the Foxborough town historian, said. “The stadium would be closed, it would get a reprieve for one game, and then there would be another closing. Another last-minute reprieve would allow a game to be played, then it would close again. This went on week after week.” When the games did go on, the crowds drank heavily, so much so that Foxborough prohibited the stadium from hosting “Monday Night Football” because of the  tumult that ensued after dark. And when the Patriots were not playing, the stadium hosted dozens of rock concerts, where pervasive drug and alcohol use caused nearby hospitals to fill with patients.Foxborough, with a pastoral common at its center, was wondering what it had gotten itself into. But over time, and with some prudent strategizing, the traffic problems diminished. Restrictions on events were imposed to make them safer and calmer. The Sullivan family lost control of the team, and the stadium was renamed Foxboro Stadium — not Foxborough — and by 1994, the businessman Robert K. Kraft had bought the team. Kraft knew he needed a modern stadium, and in 1998 seriously flirted with taking the Patriots to Hartford. Eventually, a deal was struck to build what is now Gillette Stadium, next to the site of the old stadium. The Patriots won their first Super Bowl in an upset months before Gillette Stadium opened in 2002. The last game at Foxboro Stadium was a controversial, come-from-behind, overtime playoff victory known as the Tuck Rule Game, in which an apparent New England fumble became an incomplete pass and saved the day for the Patriots. The home Foxborough magic was born.“All of a sudden, we had the Super Bowl champions and a real professional stadium,” said Mike Kelleher, a lifelong Foxborough resident and the town’s incoming fire chief. “That’s when everything changed around here. Before a 1 o’clock game, we would see every parking lot totally full with tailgaters by 10 a.m.”The vibe was transformed. The home victories became a badge of honor for the locals.“Now you hear it all the time: This is Foxborough; the Patriots don’t lose here,” said Waylon Krueger, who moved from Buffalo three years ago. “It’s a given. Look, I’m a Bills fan. I wish we had that.”Hosting the Patriots has also been enormously helpful for the town’s municipal budget, even though the stadium site is just a sliver of Foxborough along commercially dense Route 1, where Kraft’s holding company constructed a mall next to the stadium.Foxborough receives a portion of each ticket sold to events at Gillette Stadium, which amounts to $2.5 million to $3 million annually, according to the town manager, William Keegan. That total is at least doubled by other taxes generated by the Patriots’ presence in town. In addition, the Patriots make six-figure charitable donations annually to Foxborough.In the last 10 to 15 years, the town’s demographic makeup has been altered. Foxborough has had an influx of home buyers with corporate jobs who commute to Boston and Providence, R.I., which is a little more than 20 miles to the south. Larger homes have sprouted on tree-lined streets, some of them aimed at housing millionaire football players employed nearby.More than half the Patriots’ roster lives in Foxborough, and many other players live in surrounding towns.“I’m impressed with the intensity of the fan support in Foxborough; it’s almost like a college football town,” said Patriots center David Andrews, who lives in town. “And people make us feel welcome. They invite us to their homes for the holidays.”Because it is inescapable, Andrews has noticed the town’s dual spelling. But he would not wade into the 241-year-old squabble over it. The dispute may not rise to the level of  bar fights, but there are strong opinions.“You spell it long or you spell it wrong,” said Buckley, whose firefighter’s uniform has a Foxborough patch.Authelet, the town historian, supports the longer spelling as well. But the license plate on his car reads: FOXBRO.Massachusetts allows personalized plates to have no more than six letters, so he did the best he could.A few years ago, Authelet was waiting in his car at a stoplight in Philadelphia when another car pulled alongside. The driver honked his horn and held up a sign.“The guy had written on a piece of paper: Cheaters,” Authelet said, well aware of the rules controversies christened Spygate and Deflategate that have dogged Coach Bill Belichick’s team through the years.“That kind of reaction happens; it’s a fact,” Authelet said with a smile. “But most people tell me that I live in a sports lover’s paradise where the home team almost always wins.“A lot of towns would like to trade places.”"
"Will Defense Doom the Chiefs in the Playoffs? - The New York Times
KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The last time the Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs, the day broke sunny and mild, with barely a breeze. On his drive to Arrowhead Stadium that January morning in 2004, Kansas City quarterback Trent Green, hoping that a rainy chill would greet the visitors from a domed stadium, rued the weather.“I knew we would have to score a bunch of points,” Green said.The Chiefs, the highest-scoring team in the N.F.L., did: 31, a nick above their season average, and never punted. Neither, though, did the Colts. With Peyton Manning operating in ideal conditions, they scored 38.If what’s past is prologue, especially for a franchise with a postseason ledger as ghastly as Kansas City’s, then the Chiefs who will face Indianapolis in the divisional round on Saturday at Arrowhead are at risk of continuing a trend that doomed them 15 years ago.The team that wrecked the N.F.L. with an offense so potent that it recalibrated how football is played in 2018 — scoring the most points and gaining the most yards and throwing the most touchdowns — also fielded one of the worst defenses that has ever made the playoffs.[Read our predictions for the divisional round.]The Chiefs’ defense finished last or second-to-last in passing yards (4,374), total yards (6,488) and yards per rush (5.0). The Chiefs gave up the most first downs ever, with 419. And though they ranked 24th in points ceded, with 421, only three other teams since 1990, when the playoffs expanded to include six teams from each conference, gave up that many and still advanced to the postseason.According to Pro Football Reference, only 13 of the other 173 teams to reach the playoffs since 1990 have fared worse than the Chiefs in at least one of those statistical categories, including Green’s group from the 2003 season, which allowed 5.2 yards per carry. Aside from Kansas City, the only others to earn a No. 1 seed were Green Bay and New England in 2011, and neither won the Super Bowl. In fact, only one of the 13 — excluding the 2018 Rams, who allowed the most yards per rush this season — won a championship: the 2006 Colts, whose strong pass defense offset their generosity against the run.Plus, they had that Manning guy.The Chiefs have a guy, too — Patrick Mahomes — and that’s a pretty strong counterargument. But it’s not an impenetrable one, as losses to the Chargers (Kansas City led by 14 with less than nine minutes left) and the Seahawks (Seattle ran for 210 yards) proved.It’s difficult identifying a historical analogue to the 2018 Chiefs, a team of such extremes. The closest might be the 2011 Packers, whose leading receiver, Greg Jennings, recognized the similarities at once. Like the Chiefs, Green Bay created a load of turnovers — a league-high 38 — while also scoring the most points. The Packers also gave up more passing yards and total yards than Kansas City did this season.“The defense recognized it more than even we did as an offense,” Jennings, now an analyst for Fox, said of the imbalance. “What needed to be done was what we did. We recognized it and we had to make up for it.”The Packers went 15-1 before sputtering in their first playoff game, against the Giants, whose offensive coordinator, Kevin Gilbride, as could be expected, cared only about Green Bay’s schemes and personnel and not its defensive rankings. He said those were skewed by all the yardage they allowed when leading. Three weeks after exploiting the Packers’ blitzes, the Giants sustained long drives that “were almost as important as scoring,” Gilbride said, to batter New England’s defense in the Super Bowl. Both defenses, he said, outclassed the Chiefs’.“Oh, no question,” said Gilbride, who has analyzed Kansas City’s game film as part of his prep work for NBC’s broadcasts. “I think they’re vulnerable.”The Chiefs, for their part, seem aware of their inadequacies, especially in the secondary and at linebacker. Gilbride noted how the team’s defensive coordinator, Bob Sutton, has tried concealing them with deception, by mixing coverage schemes or calling more two high safety looks, intended to protect them against deep passes.Their strength is their pass-rush, which registered 52 sacks, and that just might be their path to glory. This season has demonstrated that the Chiefs’ defense need not always play well — it needs to play well only at certain times.Forcing turnovers and pressuring the quarterback are more important than preventing yardage. The Eagles’ Super Bowl victory against New England offered convincing evidence; the teams combined for a single punt, and the game turned on Philadelphia’s only sack, producing its only takeaway. The Chiefs’ 54-51 loss to the Rams this season, in a game with three defensive touchdowns, reinforced it.“Maybe you’re not playing as well as you’d like on defense,” Sutton said, “but you know, hey, we can rise up here and we get a stop here and a stop here, our offense can take care of this.”The offense has been so productive that the Chiefs have been ahead for 64.8 percent of the time they’ve been on the field — and by 11 points, or two possessions, more than half that time. They’ve played a staggering 799 defensive snaps when leading — 100 more than the next closest team, Chicago, according to Pro Football Reference.When trailing, offenses tend to throw more often, and against defenses willing to keep the play in front of them by conceding yardage. Green, an analyst for CBS, characterized Sutton’s philosophy as “bend don’t break,” though the Chiefs’ defense broke in their playoff loss last year, allowing three second-half touchdowns to Tennessee. And in their playoff loss two years ago, allowing 171 rushing yards to Pittsburgh but not a touchdown. And in their playoff loss five years ago, allowing 35 second-half points that erased a 38-10 third-quarter lead.That fiasco came against the Colts, too, but in Indianapolis. Reflecting on the Chiefs’ flop 15 years ago, Green blamed the offense — he missed some throws, a penalty negated a touchdown, a lost fumble erased Priest Holmes’s 48-yard run. He emphasized that he never once believed that the defense would constrain them.“We felt we could score on anybody,” Green said.Same with these Chiefs. They tallied at least 30 points in 12 of 16 games and averaged 32.4 at Arrowhead, where they closed the season by throttling Oakland, 35-3, in a performance that safety Eric Murray said felt “more cohesive” and “less segmented.”Murray said he was encouraged, but he will not know for sure until Saturday, when the Chiefs embark on a journey that, if it ends with confetti falling on them at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta, will have defied nearly 30 years of statistical trends.Green still lives around here, and curious, he checked the game day forecast the other night: snow showers, mid-30s, 10-to-15-m.p.h. winds. He said he turned to his wife and laughed.“I was like, ‘Why couldn’t we have had this weather back then?’”"
"Colin Kaepernick Is Silenced by a Settlement, but His Knee Spoke Volumes - The New York Times
So a compelling two-year run of American political and cultural theater comes to a deeply unsatisfying conclusion. Colin Kaepernick, a once brilliant young quarterback, chose to take a knee for his beliefs and endured apparent blackballing by the most powerful sports league in North America.It would be churlish to criticize this man for taking an unspecified financial settlement and signing a nondisclosure agreement with the National Football League after he had accused the league’s teams of colluding to keep him out. He sacrificed for his beliefs and with a dignified use of free speech, that grandest of American traditions, he came to personify a coming of political age across several sports.He persevered despite sprays of vitriol from this nation’s president, Donald J. Trump, who in 2017 used the specter of this black man to stir resentments.“Wouldn’t you love to see one of those N.F.L. owners, when someone disrespects our flag, to say: ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’ ” Trump told a crowd in Alabama.It was catnip for the vastly white crowds that roared in disgust over Kaepernick.It is galling that Kaepernick and his former teammate Eric Reid, who joined him in the protest and legal action, must remain mum about the corruptions of the industrial complex known as the N.F.L. The owners almost certainly conspired to blackball Kaepernick, ensuring that he would never throw another pass in the league.As he sought to sign on with a new team for the season after his protest began, and less than five years after he had taken the 49ers to the Super Bowl, owners came up with ever more pathetic excuses for refusing to sign a quarterback so swift and so strong of arm.Now he can say nothing about that travesty. It feels a bit like the Freedom Riders integrating a lunch counter and agreeing not to talk about it.I called Ira Glasser, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union who is also a deep-dyed sports fan. He resolutely declined to second-guess Kaepernick for surveying the ruin of his career and probably taking a large chunk of money.“He was a star who burst upon the scene explosively, and maybe he extracted as much justice as he could from this situation,” Glasser said. “But it does leave a stain on the N.F.L. that ought not to be eradicated in the public mind.”Kaepernick did not burn a flag or even hold a proud fist aloft. It’s a measure of the subtle nature of his protest that fans and sportswriters went three preseason games before they noticed that, oh yeah, Kaepernick was sitting out the national anthem.When they asked the young quarterback about it, he talked about police brutality and too many dead black Americans: “To me this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.”In the next game and thereafter, Kaepernick took a knee instead, at the suggestion of a military veteran. Yet the whirlwind of anger somehow gained in force.In the first weeks of that season, I flew to San Francisco to draw his measure. To step into the 49ers postgame locker room was to find a remarkably composed man with the support of many teammates. He walked out of the shower that night and slipped a form-fitting shirt over a lithe, tattooed torso. Then he turned to a bristling array of microphones and cameras and calmly answered every question.Are you proud, a reporter asked him, of your role in stirring players around the N.F.L. — several knelt or raised fists Sunday during the various anthems — to protest? Kaepernick, a new arrival to the world of political activism, shook his head. No airs, man, no airs.“No, no,” he said. “This movement wasn’t for me. As I’ve researched these things, as I’ve seen more and more, it’s not right.”He spoke instead of how social media and reading and looking at photographs online had driven home to him how many blacks were dying at the hands of the police.“You see things instantly, day after day, and it’s hard,” he told us before citing some of the casualties. “For me, I couldn’t see another hashtag Sandra Bland, hashtag Tamir Rice, hashtag Walter Scott.”“At what point,” he continued, “do we take a stand?”It was dissent, yes, and as unthreatening and American as you could find in a country so often given over now to partisan furies. As Glasser, the civil libertarian, said to me Friday, “If that’s not acceptable to this country, what is it that we are supposed to be fighting for?”Colin Kaepernick the football player may soon move into history’s mists. Kaepernick the human rights activist, the man Amnesty International named an ambassador of conscience, may just be coming into his own.You hope only that this young man walked away with a mother lode from the league without shame."
"Aaron Donald Doesn’t Look Like a Defensive Tackle. So He Reinvented the Position. - The New York Times
ATLANTA — The Rams selected defensive tackle Aaron Donald with their second first-round pick in 2014, No. 13 over all, which means that 11 other teams, after assembling draft boards and consulting scouts and analyzing a trilogy’s worth of film of his demolishing offensive linemen, decided against taking a player whose dominance has since redefined his position.“I think,” said Mike Waufle, the Rams’ defensive line coach at the time, “people were scared of his size.”Donald is 6-foot-1 and, coming out of the University of Pittsburgh, was listed at 285 pounds. That is enormous in human terms, but smallish for a defensive tackle, whose function in a 3-4 defense is to blot out the sun.Not everyone with the Rams coveted Donald, but Waufle was undeterred. He had long prized speed over size, and from the start, he viewed Donald as an outlier, grading him as the best prospect he had seen since 1998, his first season coaching in the N.F.L. Donald generated so much power that he reminded Waufle of the Russian boxer Ivan Drago in “Rocky IV,” who punched a computerized meter with such force that Drago’s manager remarked, “Whatever he hits, he destroys.”In his first season, Donald was selected as the top defensive rookie. Last season, he was defensive player of the year. After registering 20.5 sacks this season, the most ever by a defensive tackle, Donald will almost certainly repeat.The Rams’ ascent to a Super Bowl berth against the New England Patriots on Sunday from 4-12 buffoonery in 2016 reflects a certain harmonic convergence — the confluence of foresight, audacity and good fortune, with Donald embodying it all.Coach Sean McVay, a brilliant communicator whose football acumen pushed the Rams to the forefront of the league’s offensive frenzy, has already spawned a coaching tree, and the team has traded precious draft picks to acquire volatile personalities who have meshed in a cohesive locker room. But before all that, the Rams had the conviction to draft Donald. In 2014, he was an excellent defender. In 2019, he is the avatar for defensive disruption.With N.F.L. teams eschewing downfield passes for underneath routes, and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady averaging a mere 2.18 seconds per postseason throw in the pocket, according to Pro Football Focus, interior pressure is ever more critical. And no one plows into the backfield faster than Donald, a player New England Coach Bill Belichick called “pretty much unblockable.”“If he keeps this up,” the Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle said, “he can change the game almost like a Lawrence Taylor.”Randle transformed the position, too, playing at 6-1 and 285 pounds, but in a different era, when teams prioritized space-choking interior tackles to stop the run and tended to harass quarterbacks from the outside. Of the 54 instances in which a player had at least 16.5 sacks in a season since the statistic was first tracked in 1982, 50 came from defenders who didn’t play tackle, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Randle never quite reached that total, topping out at 15.5. But contemporaries like La’Roi Glover and Warren Sapp did, and Randle viewed them, and himself, as misfits, fueled by the perception that they weren’t fast enough to play linebacker, big enough to play offensive line or nimble enough to play running back.Across 14 seasons with Minnesota and Seattle, Randle amassed the most sacks by a defensive tackle in N.F.L. history — 137.5 — by destroying quarterbacks and game plans much as Donald does now, just with less time to get to the quarterback. Donald had a league-leading 106 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. The next closest player, Fletcher Cox of Philadelphia, had 95.“When you get that interior pressure, they can’t run the sweep, the center can’t pull,” Randle said. “When you’re in the inside, you may not get there, but you’re in the quarterback’s face, and he can’t see because the pressure’s there. He sees you, and he’s more conscious of you. You’re right there in front of him.”When watching Donald, Randle notices how his feet, hands and eyes work in concert, with a first step so quick that it can be mistaken for reflex. Donald’s arms allow him to get leverage on taller linemen — plural, considering the double teams he faces — beneath their pads, taking away their strength.“Some guys at that position are top-heavy with skinny little legs, or are big down below but have nothing up top,” Dewayne Brown, who has helped train Donald since 2009 in their native Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview. “He’s built like a block, totally proportional.”A secret: Donald may be listed at 285 pounds, but, he said Tuesday, he has been playing at 270, maybe 265. (The Rams’ other defensive tackle, Ndamukong Suh, is listed at 6-4 and 307 pounds.) Over texts, Waufle calls Donald a male model and tells him he’s pretty. Donald’s father, Archie, asked Brown to remind his son that he’s not a bodybuilder. In a photo he posted to his Instagram story Monday, a shirtless Donald is shown flexing, muscles bulging, his abdominal muscles clearly defined. Celery has more fat than he does.“He’s got, like, an eight-pack,” Rams defensive tackle Michael Brockers said.In the off-season, Brown helps Donald refine his speed and agility with 45-minute workouts laden with core exercises and resistance training, like the drill he performs wearing lateral resistors on his ankles. As someone drops a tennis ball eight yards away, Donald must sprint to grab it before it bounces a second time. Go on, try it.To increase his strength, Donald works with Dave Andrews, the strength and conditioning coach at Pitt, who called him “a genetic mutant” and “a ball of dynamite.” Andrews challenges him with exercises in which he provides Donald with resistance throughout the entire movement to isolate a particular muscle group.“It’s no different than when they’re in hand-to-hand combat on the field, and they’re manually trying to resist what he’s doing,” Andrews said. “Most likely, it takes two, maybe three guys, to slow Aaron down. You can imagine what it’s like in the weight room. Like, good luck. I walk out in a full sweat.”Donald has long been strong and thick; as an adolescent, he would wake before dawn to lift weights with his father. But Donald was “real chunky,” Brown said, when he first encountered him as a junior at Penn Hills High School.That season, Greg Gattuso, then the defensive line coach at Pitt, attended a Penn Hills game to scout one of Donald’s teammates. He had heard of Donald but had never watched him. Before leaving, Gattuso offered him a scholarship.With each successive season at Pitt, Donald had more tackles for loss. His senior year, nearly half of his 59 tackles — 28.5 — came behind the line of scrimmage. At the N.F.L. scouting combine, Donald ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 seconds, faster that year than Raiders quarterback Derek Carr (6-2, 214), Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy (6-3, 243) and Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (6-3, 251). His 10-yard split, which gauges short-area quickness, was a solid 1.65 seconds.From afar, Waufle yearned. As defensive line coach for the Giants, he replaced interior linemen with speedier ends to overwhelm Brady and unbeaten New England in Super Bowl XLII. He said he studied more game tape of Randle than Randle himself.Waufle wanted a Randle of his own.On draft night, Waufle was working on a project in his office when, around the eighth pick or so, he glanced at the television and noticed Donald was still available. He cycled through scenarios in his head.He thought Detroit, picking 10th, would grab him. He thought the Giants, picking 12th, would, too. When the Rams were on the clock, he sneaked into the draft room, hoping for good news. When he got it, he nearly yelped inside.The next time he saw Donald, told him something he had never said to another player: Don’t listen to anything I say.“We’ll get you lined up, and you just go, man — you just go,” Waufle said, relaying their conversation. “And he did. He tore the league up.”Waufle left the Rams when McVay was hired, after the 2016 season, but his successor, Bill Johnson, marvels daily at Donald.“What makes him different is no different than what makes a racehorse so great,” Johnson said. “They’re just sort of made to be, I guess. I don’t know. If I knew, I’d be cloning it.”Donald’s trajectory might have made teams reassess their evaluations of him. It might have even made them more likely to consider undersized defensive tackles in the future — imitation and flattery, and all that. But there is only one Aaron Donald, and to the dismay of every other team, but most of all New England this week, he plays for the Rams."
"N.F.L. Will Experiment With Replay Reviews of Pass Interference - The New York Times
PHOENIX — The N.F.L., in a first, will allow challenges on pass interference next season, whether flags were thrown by referees or not.The rule change, approved by a 31-1 vote of the league’s owners on Tuesday, came about two months after a controversial non-call on an apparent pass interference play influenced the outcome of the N.F.C. championship game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints.Many Saints fans, believing that the non-call led to their team’s loss, refused to watch the broadcast of the Super Bowl between the Rams and the New England Patriots.For one year only, coaches will be able to ask for a video review of possible pass interference plays, whether they have been called on the field or not. Those reviews can come in the first 28 minutes of each half. In the last two minutes of the halves, only replay officials may request a review.Sean Payton, the Saints coach, said statistics showed that pass interference plays, whether offensive or defensive, were the fouls that had the biggest effect on game.“We have essentially expanded replay to include two more plays,” he said.The N.F.L. has never had a review option for possible penalties that did not draw a flag from the officials.Rich McKay, the president of the Atlanta Falcons and chairman of the competition committee, said that a league review had shown that of the 50 most impactful calls made incorrectly last season, half had come on defensive pass interference plays. The highest number of penalties that were not called were on offensive pass interference, he said.McKay said he expected teams to propose that coaches be able to challenge other plays on which penalties are not called.“I don’t think we should be scared of replay being expanded,” he said.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the change was an attempt to address the furor over the non-call in the Saints-Rams game.Allowing challenges and video reviews of more plays will not make officiating perfect, he added. But “don’t let perfect get in the way of better,” Goodell said.Coaches will still have two challenges per game, and will still get a third if their first two are approved.Among other rule revisions, the league has now banned all blindside blocks, not just on defenseless players. Those blocks lead to about two-thirds of the injuries on punt returns, McKay said.Troy Vincent, a former player who is now the league’s executive vice president for football operations, said banning the play would make the game safer.“The blindside block, it ends careers,” he said. “To have that removed out of our game is significant.”"
"Colin Kaepernick and the N.F.L. Settle Collusion Case - The New York Times
The quarterback Colin Kaepernick ignited impassioned debates over race, activism and free expression after protesting police shootings of black men by kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” at National Football League games in 2016.The president tweeted his anger at him and dozens of other players who also knelt in protest during the national anthem. Some fans boycotted games over the players’ actions, and some boycotted the N.F.L. with the belief that Mr. Kaepernick, who failed to land a job the next season, was being blacklisted for his leadership in the movement.Now, two and a half years later, Mr. Kaepernick and a former teammate, Eric Reid, have reached a surprise legal settlement with the N.F.L., which they had accused of colluding to keep them out of the league.In a terse joint statement issued on Friday afternoon, the league and the players’ lawyers said that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that “there will be no further comment.”A confidentiality agreement means that, for all the debate and discussion the case generated, it ended with a silence that left hanging whether the league admitted there was any collusion and whether Mr. Kaepernick would ever play another down.Yet there most likely will be further discussion, as people debate whether Mr. Kaepernick was right and what enduring lesson the owners and league might draw from the saga.“The most important thing is he started a really important conversation that we’ve been having for a couple of years, and the people who were willing to have that conversation have learned some things,” said Michael MacCambridge, the author of “America’s Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation.”He added: “I suspect even if Kaepernick knew how long it would take he might have done it differently. But he took a social stand and he was willing to suffer the consequences of that.”Mr. Kaepernick, 31, who played for the San Francisco 49ers and took them to the Super Bowl after the 2012 season, has not played in the N.F.L. since the 2016 season, when he began the kneeling campaign. (At first he sat during the anthem, but a former player who is a military veteran suggested he kneel instead to make his point while respecting the American flag.)He filed a grievance under the league’s collective bargaining agreement in October 2017, months after failing to find a job, and his lawyers have been busy gathering evidence and testimony from numerous N.F.L. owners and league executives.The case seemed headed to a ruling this spring by an arbitrator, until the abrupt statement on Friday that left the sports world guessing on whether the league paid the players and how much.After protesting while playing for the 49ers, Mr. Reid, 27, also went unsigned for a period before playing most of last season for the Carolina Panthers. This week he signed a three-year contract with the team.It is unclear whether Kaepernick will continue trying to play professional football again.The settlement of their case was another unpredictable twist in a saga that began in August 2016 when Mr. Kaepernick, an African-American little known as an activist, began his protests during the anthem. He said the gesture was meant to draw attention to racism and police brutality against people of color.Several players across the league joined him in kneeling during the anthem, generating a national discussion over it and leaving the league flummoxed over how to respond. Last year the N.F.L. instituted a policy that said players could remain in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem, but that if they were on the field they would have to stand.But that policy was suspended after the N.F.L. Players Association filed a grievance, and it was never enforced.The sideline protest movement seemed to lose momentum, and few players knelt during this past season. Mr. Kaepernick has said little, reserving most of his comments for his social media accounts. During the Super Bowl this month he posted on his Instagram account pictures of athletes and celebrities wearing jerseys supporting his cause.On Friday, he only retweeted a statement from his lawyer, Mark Geragos.Mr. Kaepernick emerged from the protests as both a polarizing figure and a cultural symbol. Last year, Nike signed him to a lucrative endorsement deal even though he remained out of the league and largely silent, not typically what a brand wants from an endorser.A year before, Nike executives had decided to end their contract with Mr. Kaepernick, before being talked out of it. But with Mr. Kaepernick’s growing stature in the civil rights movement, the apparel company decided to make him a face of its “Just Do It” campaign, debuting a commercial narrated by Mr. Kaepernick during the opening game of the N.F.L. season.Legal experts have said collusion cases are notoriously difficult to prove, which makes it highly unusual for the league to settle a case like this. It is possible Mr. Kaepernick’s lawyers had gathered enough persuasive evidence and testimony from owners, league officials and football experts that Mr. Kaepernick stood a reasonable chance of persuading the arbitrator hearing the case to rule in his favor.Frank Hawkins, a former senior vice president of the N.F.L., said he thought the league was probably more worried about embarrassing statements from owners getting out through a hearing than about losing the case.“People say stupid things, things get taken out of context,” he said. “So I think there was a reasonable potential for embarrassment and it is something that if they could settle it at a reasonable cost, they would probably just think it was worth paying nuisance value.”Had Mr. Kaepernick won his case in a full hearing, he would have been eligible to receive the money he might have earned if he were signed as a free agent. In addition, he may have received double that amount in punitive damages. In his final year with the 49ers, Mr. Kaepernick earned more than $14 million.Carl Tobias, an expert on civil litigation who teaches at the University of Richmond School of Law, said that parties settle for all sorts of reasons, even when they believe they may prevail in court. But the N.F.L., he said, most likely wanted to move on from the issue rather than risk an adverse ruling that could, among other things, taint negotiations over the league’s collective bargaining agreement, which will expire in two seasons.“I think the N.F.L. just wanted to get this behind them and not have this threat hanging over them,” Mr. Tobias said. “I think they’d pay whatever they’d get away with to stop the hemorrhaging and the negative light on the league.”According to the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the union, the burden is on the player to prove that owners actively conspired against him.“That is often difficult to do because parties typically don’t leave a written record of their illegal maneuvering,” said William Gould, who was chairman of the National Labor Relations Board at the time of the Major League Baseball strike in 1994.Mr. Kaepernick, however, received a favorable ruling in August when the arbitrator overseeing the case, Stephen B. Burbank, dismissed the league’s attempt to have the case thrown out, allowing lawyers for Mr. Kaepernick to question owners and league officials in a format similar to a trial.It was anticipated that Mr. Burbank would rule on the case in the coming months, and as of last week lawyers for Mr. Kaepernick were still preparing for final hearings in front of Mr. Burbank, according to a person with knowledge of the preparations.Even though Mr. Kaepernick has not played in more than two years, and his play had grown erratic in his last months on the field, his name had continued to surface every time an N.F.L. team signed a new quarterback. Many of these quarterbacks had less experience or statistically did not seem to measure up to him.Mr. Kaepernick’s name also continued to be invoked at major N.F.L. events, including the Super Bowl this month, when musicians said they would not perform during halftime out of sympathy for his case.The Associated Press reported this week that a new league, the Alliance of American Football, spoke with Mr. Kaepernick but that he wanted at least $20 million to consider playing in it.Mr. Kaepernick’s collusion case at times also exposed a bit of a rift between himself and the players’ union. Mr. Kaepernick hired his own lawyers for the case instead of going through the union, and the union’s statement on the resolution said it was informed of the settlement by the N.F.L. and was unaware of the terms."
"Missed Call Dooms Saints, Thrills Rams and Pains New Orleans - The New York Times
NEW ORLEANS — The Saints’ locker room at the Superdome was consumed by silence. Players dressed quickly before departing. A mountain of shoulder pads formed at the center of the room, next to a couple of yellow duffel bags labeled “PLAYOFFS.” Defensive tackle David Onyemata pulled on black jeans with designer rips that revealed skinned knees.When running back Mark Ingram was asked for his reaction to the moment that had freshly defined the N.F.C. championship on Sunday afternoon, he stared at the floor in front of him and shook his head. When he finally spoke, it came out a whisper.“I can’t say any words,” he said.The topic of the day, and one that will probably linger like a noxious cloud over football-crazed New Orleans for years, was a noncall that had helped the Los Angeles Rams secure their Super Bowl berth with a 26-23 overtime victory over the Saints. On a cold day outside, the crowd left the building bubbling with rage. Most of the players tried to exercise at least some restraint.“Nothing you can do about it now,” wide receiver Tommylee Lewis said.The play in question happened late in the fourth quarter of a tie game. On third-and-10 at the Rams’ 13, Saints quarterback Drew Brees lofted a pass toward Lewis, who had run a wheel route out of the backfield toward the right sideline. But well before the ball arrived, Lewis was clobbered by cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who had his back to Brees and to the airborne ball — and later acknowledged that, yes, he had probably committed a pass-interference penalty.“I just know I got there before the ball got there, and I whacked his ass,” Robey-Coleman said.The only problem: The official closest to the play did not penalize Robey-Coleman for pass interference. It came as a shock to just about everyone, including Robey-Coleman, who recalled hearing the official yell, “Incomplete!” Per league rules, judgment calls like pass interference are not subject to video review.“I got up and I looked around, and no laundry,” Robey-Coleman said, referring to the absence of a yellow penalty flag.Had the official thrown one, the Saints would have been awarded a first down, allowing them to run down the clock before attempting a winning field goal (or even scoring a touchdown). The Rams probably never would have gotten the ball back.Instead, the Saints had to kick a field goal on fourth down that put them ahead by 23-20 with 1 minute 41 seconds to play in regulation. It turned out to be more than enough time for the Rams to march down the field and make a 48-yard field goal that sent the game to overtime. Los Angeles eventually won the game on a 57-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein.In his postgame news conference, Saints Coach Sean Payton said he had spoken by phone immediately after the game with Alberto Riveron, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president for officiating, and the league office.“The first thing Al said when I got on the phone: ‘We messed it up,’” Payton said, adding: “It was simple: They blew the call. It should never have not been a call. They said, ‘Not only was it interference, it was helmet to helmet.’ Two calls.”It was the second straight season that a Saints playoff run ended in heartbreak. Last season, it was a divisional-round loss to the Minnesota Vikings on a 61-yard touchdown reception as time expired — a fluke play that seemed impossible to replicate in terms of soul-crushing consequences.But then, there was Sunday afternoon.“That’s tough to swallow,” Brees said. “I think there were plenty of times throughout the season where there’s calls that go against you, go for you, or they miss, or they didn’t. Obviously, in a situation like that where it seemed like everybody in the world saw it, it’s tough.”Tough, too, because of the Saints’ realistic Super Bowl aspirations. They finished the regular season tied for the best record in the N.F.C., and the Rams were coming to their building, where the crowd tends to be inhospitable to opponents at best — and downright ruthless at worst. The noise was so bad for the Rams on Sunday that quarterback Jared Goff had to put tape over the ear holes of his helmet so he could hear the audio coming from his coach.Payton, though, has had a contentious relationship with the league, and an errant call — which the N.F.L. admitted making — in such a crucial moment seems sure to add to an already robust sense of injustice in New Orleans.Much of that agita stems from the so-called Bountygate scandal, in which the Saints coaching staff was found to have rewarded players who injured opponents. As a part of the fallout, Payton was barred by the league from coaching during the 2012 season, and some of the scars are still evident, all these years later.On Sunday, defensive end Cameron Jordan suggested that the referees were biased against the Saints.“We know for a long time that we don’t get calls that way,” Jordan said, adding: “As far as I’ve known, we haven’t had referees that go gung-ho for the Saints. We’ve got to put ourselves in the best position so we’re not able to be touched.“Will it haunt that ref? Who cares. Will it haunt this team? This will be something that will be another defining moment for us.”As for Robey-Coleman, the Rams cornerback who made the hit, he appeared to sense his place in football lore almost immediately.“They’re going to show that forever,” he said, referring to the clip of the play. “They’re going to show that forever. New Orleans is going to hate me.”He did not sound very sad about it."
"Robert Kraft Wouldn’t Talk to Us. Here’s How We Profiled Him. - The New York Times
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.Sometimes not knowing much about a person or a topic can make a reporter ideal for a story assignment. The panic of jumping into a world you know nothing about will usually cause you to do a ton of research and reporting. And you don’t know better than to try really hard to land interviews with people who don’t often give them, like New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.But it gets pretty complicated when you find yourself writing a profile on someone you’ve never met, whom you cannot interview, who has been intensely followed and written about for more than two decades and who is now at the center of a media firestorm.That’s the challenge I faced when my editor on the Styles desk asked me to write a profile of Robert K. Kraft, the multibillionaire owner of the New England Patriots. Mr. Kraft was charged a month ago with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution in Jupiter, Fla. My task was to find out why a guy who is, as I ended up putting it, “a billionaire six times over and an N.F.L. team owner practically running out of fingers for Super Bowl rings” visited a strip-mall massage parlor 30 minutes from his Palm Beach home.Mr. Kraft’s wife of 48 years, Myra, had died from cancer in 2011. I thought this was an important piece of information to understand his life today: awash in billionaire, N.F.L.-owning privilege, but lonesome and impacted by grief.To get started, I asked Ken Belson, who covers the N.F.L. for The Times, if he would team up with me to work on the piece. He was busy reporting on the efforts to resolve the matter before the N.F.L. owners’ annual meeting began in Phoenix last weekend. But he spent hours giving me an education in the politics, hierarchies and dramas that exist behind the scenes in the N.F.L.Then I started contacting everyone I could think of: Mr. Kraft’s lawyers and communications reps, obviously, but also anyone I have seen him linked to in press stories — Michael Rubin, an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers; the rapper Meek Mill; officials at Columbia University, to which Mr. Kraft has given tens of millions; Larry King, who I heard was at least a casual friend of Mr. Kraft’s; and Mr. Kraft’s on-and-off girlfriend Ricki Lander.That’s a short list, and not everyone called me back. But to those who did, I made a simple pitch. I wanted to tell Mr. Kraft’s story to people like me, who didn’t know much about him beyond tabloid headlines and gossip columns. I think his friends probably decided that a feature piece written by a woman who is not a football fan could help humanize him. I landed on-the-record interviews with the current and former Patriots quarterbacks Tom Brady and Drew Bledsoe, the musicians Meek Mill and Kenny Chesney, Mr. Rubin, Mr. King and others.Getting Mr. Brady to call me from his family ski vacation, rather than merely accepting the offer of an email interview, took a lot of pushing and cajoling. I explained to various public relations representatives that I would write in the story that Mr. Brady submitted comments over email through a Patriots spokesman, which doesn’t convey the same level of support of Mr. Kraft as getting on the phone for an actual interview. As Patriots coach Bill Belichick has said, “You get the job done or you don’t.” I did.Access brings its own concerns. Mr. Kraft’s friends were painting a wholly sympathetic portrait, as you would expect. But I couldn’t publish a story that sanctified Mr. Kraft and ignored the fact that he needed good P.R. to avoid damaging his most cherished and valuable asset, the Patriots. Nor could I ignore the perils of the sex trade, even if his friends made a good argument that Mr. Kraft’s case was being overly amplified by Florida prosecutors. So I stopped asking Ken Belson to join forces with me, and started begging.Now he and Mr. Brady both know how persuasive my nagging can be. Together, Ken and I aimed to deliver a newsy story that humanizes a famous man without ignoring any of the reasons that he is in the spotlight.We published the piece online Friday afternoon. Then Ken and I experienced a phenomenon that is particular to this time in history. Our story got trumped.News that the special counsel Robert Mueller’s long awaited report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was delivered to the Department of Justice right around the time we published.That’s a tough news cycle in which to compete. But we left it all on the field."
"Hidden Gems: Do the Patriots Find Them or Create Them? - The New York Times
ATLANTA — In 2000, Antowain Smith, a running back who had been the Buffalo Bills’ first-round draft pick three years earlier, was unceremoniously cut by the team. Smith had been buried on the Bills’ bench.The next season, Smith landed in the training camp of the New England Patriots, even though some of his friends wondered why he wanted to play for a team coming off a 5-11 season and for a head coach, Bill Belichick, who seemed on his way to getting fired by a second N.F.L. team.The Patriots already had two, young homegrown running backs, so what kind of chance would they give a veteran discarded by the second-rate Bills?Smith became the first conspicuous castoff to end up playing a prominent role in a Patriots championship. In New England’s first Super Bowl victory in 2002, it was Smith — not the St. Louis Rams star Marshall Faulk — who became the game’s leading rusher, with 92 yards.“I turned out to be the perfect fit that they needed,” Smith recalled in a telephone interview Thursday. “Belichick told me when I got there: ‘Do what you’re told and you’ll have a role.’ He spoke the truth.”Such surprises have become a staple of the Belichick era: The Patriots win a Super Bowl when someone they found languishing on the waiver wire — or ignored until the bottom of the draft — ends up taking a star turn on pro football’s biggest stage.It does not happen by accident, former Patriots say.“There were always younger guys that maybe got overlooked because there was a piece of their game that hadn’t been fully realized, but Bill sees the potential,” said Matt Light, a former Patriots offensive tackle. Light was not one of the lesser-known players, but he saw many of them suddenly appear in the locker room.“Bill can wait on them, and then he can insert them into roles clearly defined,” Light continued. “Their role is always very well communicated, and they can go out and experience some success. And it’s amazing what success will do for a guy off the street.”[How beloved is Tom Brady in New England?]Smith wasn’t the only unexpected hero of the 2002 Super Bowl. David Patten, a former Arena Football League player who spent four mostly mediocre seasons with two other N.F.L. teams before joining New England, scored the team’s only offensive touchdown in the game when he faked and slipped behind a defender for an 8-yard reception in the end zone that put the Patriots ahead by 11 points.Patten made 165 catches for the Patriots over four seasons, and 15 more in the playoffs.Fast forward to the next Patriots Super Bowl victory, in 2004. Wide receiver David Givens was not a reject from another N.F.L. team; he came to the Patriots as the 253rd overall pick of the 2002 draft, taken in the seventh round. He played very little in his first two seasons, catching just 43 passes. But in the 2004 Super Bowl against the Carolina Panthers, Givens emerged from the shadows to make a 5-yard touchdown reception that gave New England a 14-7 lead just before halftime.Givens had five catches for 69 yards in the game, none more important than an 18-yard reception on third-and-9 that put his team 3 yards from the end zone. It set up the Patriots’ final touchdown, with less than three minutes left.The litany of Patriots who were shrewdly lured from other teams and then became Super Bowl heroes includes Corey Dillon, who was one of the best running backs in the N.F.L. for six years, until his production for the Cincinnati Bengals dropped precipitously in 2003.Dillon’s career seemed in jeopardy as he approached his 30th birthday, and then the Patriots traded for him before the 2004 season. Dillon had the best season of his career and led all rushers in the 2005 Super Bowl. He scored a touchdown and ran for 9 key yards in the Patriots’ final scoring drive in a 24-21 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.In 2015, the surprise performer was Malcolm Butler, an undrafted, reserve rookie cornerback whose goal-line interception averted certain defeat against the Seattle Seahawks.Two seasons later, Belichick would use his background as a college lacrosse player to recruit an unlikely big-moment star. Chris Hogan, who played lacrosse at Penn State, reinvented himself as a wide receiver, playing four years for the Buffalo Bills, but they made no attempt to match the Patriots’ free-agent contract offer to Hogan before the 2016 season.In the Super Bowl that season, Hogan made a pivotal, 16-yard, third-down catch that led to the tying touchdown against Atlanta late in the fourth quarter. Then in overtime, Hogan had an 18-yard reception that helped vault New England to its fifth Super Bowl victory.“I think the Patriots have shown an ability to see guys for what they can ultimately be, and then they tailor the coaching to see if they can make it happen,” Hogan said here in Atlanta on Thursday. “The idea is to make you better at what you already do well.”Matt Chatham, who played linebacker on three Patriots championship teams from 2002 to 2005, came to New England after he was cut by St. Louis in his rookie year. He had a slightly different take on how the Patriots continually find and polish diamonds in the rough.“They’re not going to put you out in some sort of uncomfortable situation where athletically you wouldn’t be able to do it,” Chatham said. “That said, they may find the things that you do better than anyone else that another scheme doesn’t highlight.”Chatham added, “Then they find a role that fits that.”Smith, who got in nearly on the ground floor of the Belichick regime, said he thought it came down to Belichick’s renowned fastidiousness and punitive nature.“People call Belichick a defensive coach, but if you think he’s not paying attention to everything the offense and special teams are doing, then just try making a mistake in practice on one of those plays,” Smith said. “You’ll be in his doghouse real quick. And he’ll tell you that you’re in the doghouse and then he’ll let you sit on the bench and think about it for a while.“When you get another chance, or your only other chance, it doesn’t matter who you are, you’re ready to make something of it.”"
"He Traded His Yellow Flag for a Microphone. Another Super Bowl Awaits. - The New York Times
ATLANTA — Gene Steratore is back at the Super Bowl, one year after he ruled on two crucial, razor-close touchdown catches.This time, his view will be from the broadcast booth, not the field. He was hired by CBS in June to be a rules analyst for its N.F.L. and college basketball telecasts.At 55, Steratore is young enough — and fit enough — to be a referee for several more years. But after reaching the top of that profession, he is relishing doing something new, and, in some ways even more high-profile than serving as chief cop on the biggest stage in American sports. He now explains the intricacies of the rule book to tens of millions of sports fans watching on television.“The excitement of the unknown, becoming a neophyte again, at a very high level, was extremely challenging to me,” Steratore said.Steratore has made some of the most scrutinized — and denigrated — N.F.L. calls of the last decade. He overturned a potential winning touchdown catch by Detroit’s Calvin Johnson and a Dez Bryant catch for Dallas in the playoffs four years ago. Then last February, he upheld disputed touchdown grabs made by Philadelphia’s Corey Clement and Zach Ertz.“Calvin Johnson didn’t catch it. Dez Bryant didn’t catch it. Corey Clement and Zach Ertz did catch it. O.K., it’s time to quit. That’s it. I’m out of here,” Steratore said while laughing during an interview days ahead of Super Bowl LIII.[Read about sticky gloves and amazing catches.]When Steratore started wearing zebra stripes, his current job did not exist. In 2010, Fox became the first network to hire an N.F.L. rules analyst: Mike Pereira, formerly the league’s director of officiating. CBS, NBC and ESPN have followed suit. Steratore is teamed with Jim Nantz, a veteran broadcaster, and Tony Romo, a wunderkind play predictor. But if the Super Bowl is anything like the conference championship games, Steratore will be the member of the broadcast team sitting under the brightest spotlight.In the N.F.C. title game, shown on Fox, the officials failed to call an obvious penalty on Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman late in the fourth quarter after he hit New Orleans Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis before the ball arrived. The Saints went on to kick a field goal, but the Rams tied the game and eventually won it in overtime.The noncall has dominated football chatter for the past two weeks. As a result, N.F.L. rules and their interpretation are top of mind.Steratore, calling the A.F.C. Championship, had his own mess, err, messes, to deal with. After barely speaking for the first three quarters, Steratore was asked to comment on six fourth-quarter plays, including one that produced a questionable roughing-the-passer penalty against Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones.He defended Clete Blakeman, the referee who made the call, and then stated plainly that Blakeman got it wrong. “It’s a swing and a miss, and it’s a missed call for roughing the passer there,” Steratore said on the telecast.[Read what happens when players and officials chat on the field.]Steratore, one of seven brothers and sisters, comes from a family of referees. His older brother, Tony, is an N.F.L. official, and his younger brother, Michael, referees lower-division college basketball. His father, also named Gene, was a college football and basketball official, and a cousin, Frank, just officiated the college football national championship game.He is almost as close with his refereeing comrades. The head of the crew that botched the Robey-Coleman noncall, Bill Vinovich, was, with Steratore, one of the two active N.F.L. referees officiating Division I college basketball games.“Vinny and I have a special relationship,” Steratore said.He has said repeatedly this week that Vinovich’s crew got the call wrong, but also defended Vinovich, who told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play.Steratore explained that Vinovich’s specific responsibility on the play was to watch the offensive line and the quarterback, not a pass 15 yards down the field.“If you turn your head when that ball leaves and that quarterback gets hit at his knee or below and he’s laying there out, and there is no flag, it is a much more egregious mistake than this one,” Steratore said.Gerald Austin, a former referee and ESPN rules analyst for six seasons, said parts of the analyst job were harder than being a referee.There are seven officials on the field, each covering a specific area, but a rules analyst must cover it all. While analysts are watching the ball, there could be a development across the field they are asked to comment on a few seconds later, with limited time to watch a replay.“Your decision has to be quicker and more on target in a shorter period of time,” Austin said.Steratore said his job also involved educating viewers about the process of ruling on difficult calls. He quickly explains the situation and generally what the officials are considering, and then, after a few replays, he goes over the specific things they are looking at to make a call.Only after he has seen every relevant angle does he say what the call should be.“The greatest officials in the world, they’re in the N.F.L.,” Steratore said. “It is fun to hate them, and it’s part of our game and we’re cool with that. We still need to have someone explaining to the world that these people are that good at what they do, even with their mistakes.”Steratore grew up in Uniontown, Pa., and now lives in Washington, Pa., both about an hour outside of Pittsburgh. He officiated 11 Steelers game in his career, including two against their division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens. Brian Billick, the former Ravens coach, would tell Steratore he wanted him to referee every one of those games.“His reverse psychology was that if it was a 50/50 play, I might be more inclined to go his way for fear of what the public may think,” Steratore said.Billick said his request was mostly tongue in cheek, though he thought it was “worth bringing up just to get him to think about it — maybe he’ll pause.”The referee for the Super Bowl will be John Parry, who was promoted to his job in 2007 after Vinovich temporarily retired because of health problems. Steratore knows Parry well, of course. His brother Tony officiated a previous Super Bowl alongside Parry, and Parry’s late father, David, was the supervisor of officials for the Big Ten.Steratore said he expected Parry to do a great job. But if he doesn’t, or when he inevitably has to deal with an incredibly tight play, Steratore will be ready."
"What Will the N.F.L. Do About Robert Kraft This Time? - The New York Times
Roger Goodell began his tenure as commissioner of the N.F.L. in 2006 declaring that disciplining the league’s 2,000 players for their transgressions would be a priority. True to his word, the number of suspensions and fines rose, and it remains high relative to what it was.Disciplining owners, though, has been more complicated. As with players, the N.F.L. constitution gives the league commissioner broad authority to penalize owners for “conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football.”But while the players essentially work for Goodell, and have little leverage to influence his decisions, Goodell works for the owners, and those owners include Robert K. Kraft of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.Kraft, 77, was charged on Friday with two counts of soliciting sex as part of a wide-ranging investigation into prostitution and human trafficking in Florida. The police in Jupiter, Fla., used video surveillance that showed Kraft inside a massage parlor that, the police said, was used for selling sex.In a statement, the Patriots “categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.”However the case is resolved, the episode is an embarrassment to a league that likes to portray itself as a pillar of moral rectitude but that has struggled to shake an image that its players, employees and owners treat women poorly.The league has been rocked by a host of domestic violence scandals. Cheerleaders have detailed how they were exploited by their teams. Last year, Jerry Richardson, the former owner of the Carolina Panthers, was fined $2.75 million after an investigation confirmed claims that for years he sexually harassed employees.Now this.If Kraft is found to have committed a crime, even a misdemeanor, Goodell will be under pressure to penalize him to compensate for the embarrassment the league has suffered. How he treats the matter will provide an illustration of the dynamics of power at the highest ranks of the league and show the lengths he will go to appear to treat players and owners equally before the expiration of the current labor deal two years from now.Kraft may be the league’s most successful owner: His franchise has won six Super Bowl titles since the 2001 season. As a key figure in negotiating labor deals and broadcast contracts, he may also be the league’s most powerful one. He is also a confidant of the commissioner, close with the leaders of the league’s media partners and the league’s go-between with President Trump.That said, the N.F.L. includes its share of misfits and wayward sons, and from time to time, the patriarch, or, in this case, the commissioner, has to dole out justice. How much justice often depends on the stature of the owner, the offense he or she committed and any past transgressions.Some cases are straightforward. When Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty for failing to report a felony arising from a gambling fraud and extortion case, few were surprised when the commissioner at the time, Paul Tagliabue, fined him $1 million and suspended him for the 1999 season.Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, who has a history of substance abuse, pleaded guilty to driving while impaired, and was promptly suspended for six games and fined $500,000 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.Kraft’s case is more complicated. He was charged with two misdemeanors, and those charges may be reduced or dropped as charges of soliciting a prostitute often are. Kraft is not married. His wife, Myra, died of cancer in 2011.Hugh Culverhouse Jr., who was involved in league matters when his father owned the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and who practiced federal criminal law for 30 years, said Goodell would most likely wait to see if the charges against Kraft were dropped, and then might only issue a fine.Even so, he suggested Kraft was likely to be treated with kid gloves because he is among the most powerful owners. Kraft also sits on the compensation committee, which determines the size of Goodell’s paycheck.“He essentially could be sanctioned for bad taste,” Culverhouse said. “It will come down to embarrassment.”In a statement, the N.F.L. said it is “aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.”At the very least, the commissioner will have to appear not to have one set of rules for players and another for owners. There are differences, though. Player penalties are negotiated by the players’ union and the league and included in the collective bargaining agreement.The league’s constitution says Goodell can suspend or fine an owner (for no more than $500,000), or both. A suspended owner cannot go to the team’s training facility or stadium.If warranted, the commissioner can refer the matter to the entire group of owners, which can vote to impose additional penalties.That is unlikely to happen in Kraft’s case. Jodi Balsam, who was a lawyer at the N.F.L. and now teaches at Brooklyn Law School, said the league often waits until legal cases are resolved before penalties are assessed. Prostitution cases are often adjudicated quickly, she said, though this case will receive more scrutiny because it is part of a human trafficking investigation.“If he is convicted, that would seem to bolster the case for commissioner discipline,” she said. And “even if he escapes criminal penalty, the league can conduct its own investigation and decide to penalize him.”Goodell and the Patriots have butted heads before, over Spygate, in which the Patriots were found to be filming their opponents’ sideline to steal signals, and Deflategate, in which a league investigation determined it was most likely that the team had deliberately deflated footballs in inclement weather so players could grip the ball better.Kraft didn’t hide his anger about the penalties his organization received in those cases. This one, of course, is different."

"Was C.T.E. Stealing His Mind? A Gunshot Provided the Answer - The New York Times
DIXON, Calif. — The blast from upstairs shattered the quiet of a small-town weeknight. It was all so sudden. Or had it been coming for years?Jason Hairston had just been downstairs with his young son and daughter, who could not understand why their father was acting so strange. His wife, on the phone from across the country, was desperately trying to get her husband to say something, anything.He ended the call without a word, walked upstairs and closed the bedroom door. He lay down on his wife’s side of the bed, lifted a gun under his chin and pulled the trigger.The son, Cash, was 10, old enough to have previously Googled “C.T.E.”, wise enough to know what had just happened, poised enough to block his 9-year-old sister, Coco, from instinctively running upstairs toward the sound. He pulled her outside. The police and family members were on the way.If there is such a thing as the American dream, Hairston, at 47, gave every indication that he was living it. He was a former college football star who played briefly with two N.F.L. teams, and he was the founder of KUIU, a top-end outfitter of hunting gear and apparel. He had legions of faithful customers and good friends who aspired to be like him.He traveled to the most remote and rugged edges of the earth in search of quiet adventures and big game. He had just returned from a caribou hunting trip in Alaska with his father and son. And he had been sheep hunting with Donald Trump Jr. in the Yukon a couple of weeks before.He had recently described his wife and business partner, Kirstyn, during a 20th anniversary dinner toast as “truly my rock, my soul mate, the most loyal wife you could ever have.”They had family photos that looked like the kind that come with the frame. They lived in a grandly renovated home just a block and a half from where Kirstyn’s family ran the city of Dixon’s favorite gathering spot, Bud’s Pub and Grill, at the corner of First and A Street. It was two miles from the headquarters of KUIU, which has been heralded as a runaway business success.Hairston had it all, or so it seemed. Then the gun went off. And the questions echoed long after everything went quiet on that Tuesday evening in September.The case of Jason Hairston is unusual for at least two reasons. First, he was convinced, years ago, that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the progressive degenerative brain disease caused by repeated hits to the head. It can be diagnosed with certainty only in the dead, but he and Kirstyn, now 46, intensely studied the research. They saw a clear picture of Hairston in all the data points and accounts of deteriorating brains, especially in football players.Second, Hairston defied the image of a diminished victim of C.T.E. He was in near-perfect physical health, with 3 percent body fat and model-handsome looks. Confident and charismatic to the end, his public persona contradicted the corruption he felt in his brain.“He was very open about it, but I just didn’t see it,” Brendan Burns, Hairston’s closest hunting partner and a KUIU executive (now co-chief executive), said shortly after Hairston’s death. “I was like: ‘Dude, I think you’re overthinking this. You’re paranoid.’ Because what you read about is the guy who can’t get out his front door. He was so sharp. Maybe that’s why I didn’t think much about it. It was conceptual. It wasn’t like we were on a sheep hunt and he’s trying to skin a sheep with a spoon.”Hairston was a linebacker in high school and at the University of California, Davis, not far from Dixon. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in May 1995, and spent part of the season on the team’s practice squad. The Denver Broncos signed Hairston the next May, but he left the game for good a month later with numbness from a lingering neck injury in college.An avid hunter, he saw an open niche in high-end hunting apparel, a market overlooked by the likes of the North Face or Patagonia. Hairston co-founded Sitka Gear in 2005, and after a management shuffle, he moved on to start KUIU, a direct-to-consumer company, in 2011.Hairston became KUIU’s public face, an aspirational figure. Photos and videos of him hunting sheep, moose, bear and other big game were featured in the company’s savvy social media marketing and glossy catalogs. Forbes reported that KUIU did $50 million in sales in 2016.I spent time with Hairston in Dixon in 2016 while exploring story ideas. (It eventually led to an article in 2017 titled, “The Ultimate Pursuit in Hunting: Sheep”; Hairston and Burns played roles.) Hairston was focused and engaging, which made it a surprise when he mentioned that he thought he had C.T.E.He had a history of concussions, he said, too many to remember. He was fighting headaches, mood swings, impulsivity — all symptoms of C.T.E., which shares characteristics with Alzheimer's disease.Knowing that I had written many accounts of C.T.E., including one shortly before we met, about the former Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, he and Kirstyn were inquisitive.They used their full range of contacts and money on doctors, tests, medications and advice, all in hopes of slowing the effects. Hairston tried diets and hyperbaric chambers. The more he felt his mind slip, the more he exercised his body. The more he worried about time, the more things he crammed into whatever time he had left.In November 2017, Hairston emailed me a photograph of him and his son with Goliath, an aging and elusive desert bighorn sheep they hunted on a tag purchased at auction for $235,000. That bid was a part of the article published months earlier.“He is the new CA State Record Ram, 12 years old and as big as everyone who hunted him previously thought he was,” Hairston wrote. “Enclosed are photos of my Cash and I. It was such an amazing experience to share with my son.”Less than a year later, his suicide shocked family and friends, admiring strangers and loyal customers. It did not surprise Kirstyn, who had watched the decline close up.“We were really good at hiding it,” she said.The couple’s suspicions were right. Hairston had C.T.E.Bennet Omalu, a clinical professor at  U.C. Davis, made the diagnosis at his lab in Stockton. The results, part of a 44-page autopsy, had not previously been revealed publicly.“He has C.T.E., there is no question about it,” Omalu said in an interview, describing the buildup of abnormal and cell-strangling tau proteins he found across most regions of Hairston’s brain. “Those are the telltale signs, undeniably. This was almost a replica of Mike Webster’s brain.”Omalu discovered the disease in Webster, a Hall of Fame lineman who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and who died in 2002 at age 50. That diagnosis connected C.T.E. to football in the national consciousness, and garnered Omalu a measure of fame. He was played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie “Concussion.”A malady formerly attached to “punch drunk” boxers, C.T.E. has now been found posthumously in more than 200 former football players, including more than 100 who played in the N.F.L., plus an array of athletes in sports ranging from hockey to soccer, rodeo to BMX. Much of the research about the condition has centered on brain injuries in the military.Scientists are on the verge of being able to confidently diagnose C.T.E. in the living. It promises to be a game-changer, leading to all sorts of complex ethical questions in sports.When a football star receives a C.T.E. diagnosis, for example, who will decide whether he should stop playing? Will high schools, colleges and professional teams have an obligation to test and reveal the results? Will athletes in all sports, at all ages, have the option to be tested?Hairston embodied some of that coming anxiety. During news media interviews in recent years, he sometimes mentioned offhandedly that he thought he had C.T.E. The conversations always moved on quickly.Even those who hunted with him regularly said they did not see cause for concern. Paul Bride, an outdoors photographer who worked for KUIU, accompanied Hairston on all his expeditions.“I saw him on his best days, in the best place he could be — the mountains,” Bride said.In hindsight, though, his friends said maybe Hairston had become more forgetful, a bit less predictable. None of those close to him were alarmed enough to worry that he might end his life. He had it all.Privately, though, the Hairstons struggled to hold it together. Jason Hairston routinely broke down and cried, Kirstyn said, scared of where his brain was headed. When a scan revealed deterioration in the frontal lobe that had not been present a year earlier, she said, Hairston made her promise she would never make him have another test, because he did not want to know the results.A slow decline over the past decade, she said, sped suddenly into a drop.“The last 18 months, he wasn’t there,” she said, sitting in the living room of the family home. “It was like a switch flipped. He was so different. We were going from one crisis to another. I felt like I was drowning.”Impulsivity spiked through flashes of infidelity and alcohol abuse. (He had been in alcohol rehabilitation about 10 years earlier, Kirstyn Hairston said.) Hairston showed unfamiliar anger — toward the children, the family pets, other drivers on the road. He sometimes fell to his knees with headaches, complaining of ice picks to his brain. He dropped into dark periods of depression, his wife said, tinged with fear of being alone. “I knew it was C.T.E.,” Kirstyn said. “I read everything I could. This was such typical behavior for C.T.E.”She cried as she delved into details.“He said, ‘If you leave me, I’ll be dead in three months,’” she said. “And I said, ‘You’ll be dead in a week.’ But I needed him for the kids. And I know he would have stayed for me.”The two were apart for most of Hairston’s last month. He went on two hunts. Kirstyn was invited to New York with friends, a rare time away. They crossed paths at the Sacramento airport. He was on his way home. She was on her way out. He took the children. “He said: ‘You think I can’t take care of our kids for three nights? I’m good,’” Kirstyn said. “I said, ‘O.K.’ You always want it to work out.”They shared a long embrace, then spoke on the phone the next evening, discussing KUIU. (Kirstyn worked alongside her husband and remains the chairwoman and majority owner.) Jason ordered pizza for the children. The couple laughed at the role reversal, she said. Usually she was the one at home with them.She was at dinner in New York two hours later when her son called, saying that Jason was behaving oddly. She asked to talk to him. Her husband held the phone to his ear but said nothing. He hung up.Kirstyn Hairston called her parents, who lived a few blocks away, to ask them to rush to the house.When she called her son again, the gun had already gone off.The autopsy found a blood-alcohol level of 0.22 percent, two to three times the typical limit for drunken driving. His system also contained sertraline and trazodone, prescription medications commonly used to combat depression and anxiety.Kirstyn Hairston had a feeling the day would come. But not so soon.“I thought I had another five years,” she said through tears. “I really did.”But she believed that if Hairston ever took his life, he would shoot himself in the chest to preserve his brain for examination, as Dave Duerson did in 2011 (at age 50) and as Junior Seau did in 2013 (at 43). Both posthumously received diagnoses of C.T.E. Still, Omalu said there was plenty of Hairston’s brain tissue to study. The answer he provided — the positive diagnosis of the C.T.E. that the Hairstons long presumed — brought some measure of relief.“I’m not surprised Jason killed himself,” Kirstyn Hairston said. “I’m surprised he did it with our kids in the house. I’m surprised he did it here. But would you want to live if you knew you were losing your mind? Especially being really young and really healthy?”She let the questions linger, unanswered. The house went quiet.If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources."
"Letting Landon Collins Leave Continues a Disturbing Trend for the Giants - The New York Times
The Giants on Tuesday allowed the three-time Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins to enter free agency rather than use an $11.15 million franchise tag that would have kept him a Giant.It was startling decision because Collins, 25, was one of the few stars on a porous defense that even the Giants’ brain trust blamed for a dispiriting 5-11 record last season.But more alarming is that Collins’s departure continues a discouraging trend in recent Giants history: the procession of top draft picks discarded by the team.Collins was a second-round selection in 2015. The Giants traded three picks (in the second, fourth and seventh rounds) to move up so they could take Collins with the first choice of the second round.Now Collins, in the early part of his prime, is unencumbered in free agency, where he will draw considerable interest. It’s a familiar fate for a Giants draft pick.In 10 drafts from 2008 to 2017, the Giants selected 70 players. Only seven are still with the team.The player the Giants chose in the first round ahead of Collins in 2015, tackle Ereck Flowers, was a colossal bust and was cut from the team early last season. In fact, no other player from the Giants 2015 draft class is still on the roster.That is hardly an aberration. The only player left from the 2014 draft class is Odell Beckham Jr. No player selected in 2013 is still with the team, and only two from 2016 are in a Giants uniform.The Giants’ approach to team building — if that’s even an appropriate term since they have had just one winning season since 2012 — has been highly unconventional as compared with their peers. In an era of salary cap restrictions, most N.F.L. teams have treated their draft selections like prized jewels to be coveted as they molded rosters with carefully chosen picks from the amateur draft.Collins certainly appeared to be the one selection of the Giants’ 2015 draft who would make the team proud for many seasons. After an uneven rookie season, a typical outcome for a first-year defensive back, Collins had five interceptions and 100 solo tackles in his second season, resulting in his being named to the All-Pro team.Collins’s production slumped slightly in the next season when he was not 100 percent because of injury. The same was true in 2018, but Collins still made the Pro Bowl in each of the last two seasons. He led the team in tackles in each of his four seasons.Collins also grew into a respected team leader who was a dependable, stand-up presence in an often fractious locker room that endured two coaching changes and consistent losing.It is true that Collins’s strengths as a player are as a run stopper, and last season his lack of downfield coverage skills were occasionally laid bare by opponents. Every year, the N.F.L. becomes more of a pass-first league, and it’s possible that the Giants will seem prescient for not investing heavily in a safety who might not be as valuable in a few years when teams are throwing the football 70 percent of the time — or more often.And then, of course, there is considerable salary that Collins would have commanded under the Giants’ franchise tag. More than $11 million is a lot for a safety. But the Giants could have negotiated a long-term contract with Collins to mitigate the annual cost.Meanwhile, it’s hard to forget that Eli Manning, who is 38 and has won eight games as the Giants’ starting quarterback in the last two seasons, will count $23.2 million against the Giants’ salary cap in 2019.The overarching strategy of Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman, who has been charged with fixing most of the draft choice blunders made by his predecessor, Jerry Reese, is not clear. Gettleman may be counting on the Giants receiving a high-round compensatory draft pick when Collins signs with another team. In addition, Gettleman may have feared that Collins, if designated with the franchise tag, would stay away from the team throughout training camp this summer, a negotiating tactic employed in recent years by other players seeking long-term deals. The Giants may not have wanted that distraction.What is known is that a poor Giants defense just got substantially worse. The Giants will now have more money to pursue free agents to resolve that expanding deficiency. And, bucking a trend, they had better draft wisely."
"Joe Flacco Is Reportedly Headed to the Broncos. But Mum Is the Word. - The New York Times
On Wednesday afternoon, the lead story on DenverBroncos.com was about Joe Flacco. So were the website’s top three featured videos. The team also posted about Flacco on Twitter and Facebook.All of that happened while Flacco, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback, was still officially a member of the Baltimore Ravens.In the Broncos’ latest attempt to solve their quarterback problems, they are expected to trade for Flacco, but the N.F.L. calendar does not allow the deal to be completed until March. That leaves the team in the awkward position of trying to acknowledge the move without stating that it happened.Provided the deal, first reported by ESPN, does not fall apart, the Broncos will presumably be replacing Case Keenum, the incumbent starter at quarterback.Flacco, 34, got off to a 4-5 start last season with Baltimore before missing some time with an injury, then lost his job because of a remarkable performance by his substitute, Lamar Jackson, whom the Ravens had chosen in the first round of the 2018 draft.Flacco, a first-round pick by the Ravens in 2008, had started 157 of Baltimore’s 163 games leading up to the hip injury that effectively ended his time with the team. His tenure included five 10-win seasons and reached its peak in 2011, when he led a thrilling run through the playoffs that culminated in a win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII.The Broncos, who signed Keenum as a free agent last off-season, finished 6-10 in 2018, the third consecutive year in which they failed to make the playoffs.Despite having John Elway, a Hall of Fame quarterback who won two Super Bowls with the Broncos, running the team’s football operations, Denver has struggled considerably at the position in recent years.Peyton Manning was a shell of himself as the Broncos’ quarterback in 2015, but the defense and running game did enough to dominate the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. A parade of quarterbacks since — Trevor Siemian, Paxton Lynch, Brock Osweiler and Keenum have all started games — have failed to live up to that standard, combining to go 20-28.Now the Broncos appear to be turning to Flacco, who has no guaranteed money left in his contract but has base salaries over the next three years of $18.5 million, $20.25 million and $24.25 millionThe notion that Flacco is an upgrade from Keenum is debatable. In his lone season with Denver, Keenum, 30, completed 62.3 percent of his passes, with 18 touchdowns, 15 interceptions and an adjusted-yards-per-pass figure of 6.1. Those numbers were well below what he had produced as a fill-in starter for Minnesota in the previous season. But the numbers make him, at the very least, competitive with Flacco, who is more than three years older and had 12 touchdowns, six interceptions and 6.4 adjusted yards per pass.Keenum, who is guaranteed $7 million of his $18 million salary next season, will presumably be shopped to other teams.The move, while somewhat questionable for Denver, makes sense for Baltimore. The team was in a tailspin when Flacco was injured, and it appeared that Coach John Harbaugh’s job was in jeopardy.After Jackson stepped in, the offense was reborn as a run-first attack unlike anything the league had seen in decades. Jackson went 6-1 as a starter, and while his passing clearly needed work, he ran for 695 yards, or 4.7 yards a carry.Despite a devastating wild-card round loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, the Ravens were presumably already committed to Jackson as their starter. The Broncos are expected to send the Ravens a fourth-round draft pick, giving Baltimore a decent return on a player who had gone just 24-27 over the last four seasons."
"Saints Beat Patriots in “Super Bowl LIII.” - The New York Times
If you sat through Sunday’s football-related entertainment, you could be forgiven for swearing off Super Bowls forever.That might be too precipitous. Quite a few recent games have been thrillers with lots of touchdowns and exciting moments.Just last year the Philadelphia Eagles won their first championship in half a century in a 74-point classic. The year before the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons battled into overtime. In the last 10 years, we have had Patriots 28-Seattle Seahawks 24, Baltimore Ravens 34-San Francisco 49ers 31 and Giants 21-Patriots 17.Sunday was more of a throwback to the late 1980s and early ’90s, when the Denver Broncos or the Buffalo Bills were getting demolished year after year and Super Bowls let the public down as frequently as Star Wars prequels.And come on now. Was Sunday’s game even really all that bad?Yes. Yes it was.But with the help of a time machine, or something, maybe we can tweak the past just a little and make Sunday’s game just a little more like the recent squeakers.Close your eyes and imagine:The New Orleans Saints brought the N.F.L. title to Bourbon Street with a 49-41 victory over the New England Patriots destined to be a modern classic.Drew Brees led New Orleans’s high-powered offense, which scored 40 or more points six times this season, to one of its most potent results, throwing for six touchdowns.The Saints had found their way into the Super Bowl after Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman was called for eight different penalties after his helmet-to-helmet hit on Tommylee Lewis in the N.F.C. championship game. The Saints scored on the next play, giving the Rams too far to come back.Brees showed veteran poise on Sunday by repeatedly finding Lewis and Michael Thomas. “When you’re a young quarterback who has never been to the big game before, you will make mistakes against a great defense,” Brees said. “Thankfully no one like that faced the Patriots today.”At 41, Tom Brady defied his years with an aerial show of his own that fell just short, taking advantage of a Saints defense that almost seemed to want him to score, just to get the ball back in Brees’s hands.Only special teams fans were disappointed, as neither team ever sent out the punting unit.Here are the fans celebrating:The halftime show by Taylor Swift also got great reviews.The Kansas City Chiefs won their first title since the days of Len Dawson with a 54-51 triumph over the Rams.Patrick Mahomes threw for five touchdowns and ran for one more.The Chiefs had made it into the big game after an overtime victory in the A.F.C. championship; they won the coin toss and marched down the field to score, never giving the Patriots a touch.Every time Mahomes got the ball on Sunday there was a sense that something exciting was about to happen: a no-look pass, a rocket fired into a tiny space, an improvisation that made something out of nothing. About the only thing you knew you weren’t going to get was a punt.The Rams gave as good as they got, with Jared Goff picking apart the unheralded Chiefs defense for three touchdowns of his own. Todd Gurley provided fans of the running game something to cheer with a 100-yard effort.Chiefs Coach Andy Reid kept things interesting, nearly throwing the game away late with puzzling clock management, repeatedly going into full huddle despite trailing with time expiring. But the error just made Mahomes’s eventual touchdown scramble with zero seconds on the clock all the more thrilling.The Chiefs now look poised to become the sport’s new dynasty with the 23-year-old Mahomes ready to star for years to come. But the ageless Brady and the Patriots, the resurgent Eagles or Steelers, the Saints and Rams will have something to say as well. It looks like a golden age of Super Bowls is upon us.The Chiefs hometown paper celebrated:The halftime show by Cardi B. also got great reviews.Now wasn’t that more satisfying? Maybe next year."
"Opinion | How I Learned to Love the Patriots (Again) - The New York Times
I became a besotted baseball fan at the age of 6, watching the Boston Red Sox, my mother’s ancestral team, march to the World Series against the New York Mets. My parents woke me up near midnight on Oct. 25, 1986, to come downstairs with them and “watch the Red Sox win” — an eventuality that was, at that moment, just a single out away. It remained one out away through three singles, a devastating wild pitch and an incident that shall not be described involving one William Joseph Buckner. I wept, slept and awoke a gloomy pessimist, forever haunted by the fall of man.I became a football fan around the same time, and I figured I should root for the Patriots as well, in New England solidarity. They had recently played (albeit embarrassingly badly) in a Super Bowl, so I was unaware of their long, distinguished legacy of lousy play. But by the time I turned 10 and they were working their way through a 1-15 season, with a 2-14 encore just around the corner, I understood a little better the implications of my choice.This combination of Red Sox tragedy and Patriot futility defined my relationship to professional sports until adulthood, at which point (as you may have heard) absolutely everything changed for both teams and they became insufferably dominant. And my fandom, forged in suffering and melodrama and “wait ’till next year” rue, never quite recovered from my favorite teams’ success.Everyone leaves certain childish things behind, of course. But there is no greater chasm in the remembered continuity of the self than the gulf separating me from the version of myself whose mind was at least 35 percent baseball from February until October and 20 percent football for the rest of the year, who screamed and raved my way through crucial games and crucial months, and who once talked a boss into letting me off work early because of the psychic damage inflicted by Aaron Boone’s Sox-crushing, American League Championship Series-winning home run the prior night.I remember that person, but I can’t remember how he felt. And trying to raise my children to be New England sports fans in an age of constant New England winning has given me real sympathy with the lukewarmly religious, the Christmas-and-Easter sort of believer who wants to impart some measure of piety to their children without really experiencing the flame of faith themselves.There are reasons besides Bostonian sports success for the dying of that flame. My current editors probably wouldn’t let me out of column writing after a devastating loss, and normal adult obligations leave less time for rereading Roger Angell’s season-recapping baseball essays for the 847th time.But the frequent triumphs of the Sox and Pats have been crucial to my loss of ardor. In the old days I was always mystified about how Yankee fans stirred up the same excitement year after year despite their constant winning, and as my teams became increasingly Yankee-like the mystification remained. Indeed, I missed the thirst enough to seek the feeling elsewhere — adopting long-suffering franchises temporarily (until the Kansas City Royals ruined our affair by winning the World Series) to remind myself of what it was like to nourish long-unrequited hopes.Despite that infidelity, though, I’ve never taken the step of actually rooting against one of my childhood teams. Which has kept me connected to both of them, however dutifully.And now that the Patriots have ground their way, in a terrible-to-watch game highlighted by punts, to yet another Super Bowl victory, I want to report a change in my sports psychology. In my dutiful connection to the latest run of Patriot Super Bowl appearances, I have begun to feel something different, strange and unfamiliar — not a recovery of the old romance, but a growing appreciation of pure, ruthless effectiveness, an admiration for iron efficiency, a joy at the dismantling of highly touted rivals, a feeling that almost … almost … makes me begin to have a trace of a scintilla of understanding for what it feels like to be a Yankees fan.I say this as someone who feels no particularly personal sympathy or affection for the two men, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, who have delivered the Patriots their extraordinary dynasty. Belichick is an unpleasant perfectionist whose cultivated public misanthropy and “look at me, a slob” outfits often seem like an irritating sort of performance art. Brady preferred the supermodel charms of Gisele Bündchen to Bridget Moynahan, the nice Catholic ex-girlfriend (I saw them at Mass together once, so I'm totally in her camp) who was carrying his child — and then succumbed, via Gisele, to a pro-athlete equivalent of the Gwyneth Paltrow-Goop worldview.And without delving into the arcana of Deflategate, it’s obvious that the Patriots’ search for a competitive edge has taken them to at least the edge of, you know, cheating.So the old fake-personal bond that I felt for my flawed New England heroes — Yaz! Nomah! Bledsoe! — isn’t there with Brady and Belichick today. What is there, and increasingly as their dynasty has become more improbably extended, is something very different: a zest for on-field excellence simply for its own sake, a forgiveness of personal and even moral deficiencies because the record speaks for itself, a setting aside of feel-good narratives and romantic underdog stories because the sheer force of winning trumps them all.Oh, did someone say Trump? Yes, it’s appropriate that the Patriots are Donald Trump’s favorite team, but not because they have too many white players or because their consistent, grinding, rigorous success somehow resembles his improbable and often ridiculous ascent. Rather it’s because the Patriots are the actual thing that his grifter’s instincts and “Great Again” sloganeering are constantly trying to evoke — a dependably, reliably excellent American institution, of the kind that people in the pre-Vietnam era took for granted, and that our own era struggles to reproduce.The Patriots are to football what the Apollo and Manhattan Projects were to military-industrial-complex science, what IBM and General Motors were to big business, what the Hoover Dam and Mount Rushmore were to public works — with Belichick as their Patton-meets-Eisenhower impresario, by turns a jerk and a bore but a winner above all. They are a throwback, a constant rebuke to the decadence visible in every other American institution (their First Fan’s White House very much included), a last bloom of the can-do genius that won us World War II …… sorry, getting a little carried away here. The point is that unlike my beloved Red Sox, who now win just often enough to make me feel some Catholic-with-Calvinist-ancestors guilt over their success, the Patriots have over the last few years passed into new territory, a new sphere of fan experience. For the first time since I was in college and they were scrappy underdogs, their every victory makes me want them to win more — to boldly go, like Neil Armstrong and James T. Kirk, where no team has gone before …… sorry, carried away again. The point, the point, is that I am a changed fan, or at least a changing one. With every Patriot victory, I am winning the victory over myself. I am shedding old habits, jettisoning the underdoggery and romance of my childhood, learning to love dynastic rule.The Super Bowl is over. But next season is coming. Brady isn’t retiring. Belichick is going back to his tapes and plots and schemes. Six Super Bowl rings? That’s nothing.How did Patton put it? Americans love a winner and can’t tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time …Let’s make it seven."
"The Game-Changing Women of the N.F.L. - The New York Times
Welcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.“The guys don’t think of me as a female; they see me as just another official.”— Sarah ThomasI am that N.F.L. fan. The one who leads the fight song, takes my fantasy team too seriously and won’t give my father-in-law back his Eagles jersey. I even cemented my team loyalty in my wedding vows.In recent years, though, my enthusiasm has waned — with each revelation about sexual harassment (most recently by cheerleaders and office workers), domestic abuse and the effect of the sport on players’ brains.But long before these problems came to light, I found the lack of women in leadership roles in the sport irritating. We often discuss the need for more women in the boardroom, but what about in the locker room, a team’s back office and on the sidelines?So I was encouraged this weekend to see Sarah Thomas become the first woman to officiate an N.F.L. playoff game. Thomas, a Mississippi native and a mother of three, had already broken plenty of ground in the sport — becoming the first full-time female official in N.F.L. history in 2015. She was also the first woman to referee a major college football game, a bowl game and a game in a Big Ten stadium.Thomas wasn’t the only first over the weekend. In a playoff game on Saturday, Terri Valenti became the first female replay official.The news got me thinking about the women who had already changed football — the ones who have smashed through the gender wall without pads, a helmet or much fanfare. Here are three worth remembering.______“I might be the first, but I don’t think I’ll be the only one for very long.”— Kathryn SmithIn 2016, Kathryn Smith was hired by the Buffalo Bills head coach, Rex Ryan, as a quality control special teams coach, making her the N.F.L.’s first full-time female assistant coach.At the time of her promotion, Smith said the move “shows somebody if you work hard that you can do whatever you set your mind to, and if that’s the message that’s getting across to girls, boys, whoever it is, then I think that’s a good thing.”“I might be the first, but I don’t think I’ll be the only one for very long,” she said, and she was right.In August 2017, Katie Sowers of the San Francisco 49ers became the second woman to be hired as a full-time assistant coach. She is also the first openly gay N.F.L. coach.After Ryan was let go after the 2016 season, Smith was not retained by the Bills’s new head coach, Sean McDermott.______“It was a tremendous feeling of just satisfaction of all the hard work and all the time spent trying to prepare for that opportunity.”— Beth MowinsIn September 2017, Beth Mowins became the first woman to call a nationally televised N.F.L. game: a Monday Night Football divisional matchup between the Los Angeles Chargers and Denver Broncos.By doing this, she also became the second female play-by-play announcer in N.F.L. regular season history. Gayle Sierens, a sports anchor in Florida, announced a game in 1987.Mowins was hired by ESPN in 1994. Since 2005, she has called play-by-play games for women’s college sports and for college football. She has also been the voice for the Oakland Raiders’ preseason games in recent years.______“Work as hard as you can. And when you don’t think you can work any harder, try to find a way to work harder.”— Amy TraskIn 1997, Amy Trask became the first female chief executive officer of an N.F.L. team, the Oakland Raiders — a position she held until 2013.Trask is a self-made woman in the industry. In the 1980s, while in college, she cold-called the Raiders and offered to work as an unpaid intern. A few years later, in 1987, the team’s legal department brought her on as a full-time lawyer. She ascended to the top from there.Trask left the team in 2013, and in 2016, her book, “You Negotiate Like A Girl: Reflections on a Career in the National Football League,” was published.______Donation bins around the country are overflowing thanks to the binge-worthy Netflix reality show “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo.” But while some quickly kissed their belongings goodbye, others have noted how the show starkly displayed the persistence of traditional gender roles.Several episodes feature inept husbands inexplicably surprised by the misery of their overburdened wives. In an article for Vice about how the show “is inadvertently about women’s invisible labor,” Nicole Clark wrote that it lays bare the ways women are burdened with the management of a family’s stuff. “Things are the dominion of women, and the place where these things are stored are the dominion of women too,” she wrote. ____________The very first Super Bowl was a real battle — not between Green Bay and Kansas City (the Packers crushed the Chiefs) — but between husbands and wives in and around New York City, evidently. The women shrieked “blah!” while the men were hypnotized, according to a Times article in 1967. “He’s obsessed with watching all those big lugs on the idiot box, and I’m obsessed in the exact opposite way,” Lucretia Amari said of her husband.So where were all the female humans during the big game? According to the piece, “Girls — little and big — stormed into kitchens, slammed the door and waited. And waited.” Sign up here to get future installments of In Her Words delivered to your inbox.

"Boring Game Plus New Orleans Rebellion Leads to Ratings Drop - The New York Times
It was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, a universally agreed-upon snoozefest. The halftime show was forgettable. The commercials were tame.The fans watching at home noticed, and Super Bowl broadcaster CBS paid the price.CBS announced Monday that 98.2 million people watched the New England Patriots defeat the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, on CBS, the smallest television audience since 2008, when the New York Giants defeated the Patriots. That is a 5 percent drop from last year, when 103.4 million people watched the Super Bowl on NBC, and a 12 percent drop from 2017, when 111.3 million people watched it on Fox. CBS said 2.6 million people streamed the Super Bowl, setting a digital viewership record, for a total audience of 100.7 million, which means compared with two years ago, people really did not care for this Super Bowl.That was especially true in New Orleans, where a sense of righteous indignation from fans whose hometown Saints were the victims of poor refereeing contributed to the audience collapse. The Saints lost to the Rams in the N.F.C. championship game after a blown call helped the Rams send the game to overtime. The N.F.L.’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, later admitted the call was blown.Though New Orleans isn’t one of the country’s largest television markets, it is one of the most fervent for football, typically rating among the highest in the country for the proportion of households watching the Super Bowl. But Sunday’s game only earned a 26.1 overnight rating in New Orleans; last year’s Super Bowl earned a 53.0. It was the lowest rating for New Orleans in Super Bowl history.Instead of watching the game, thousands of Saints fans staged a French Quarter protest parade. LaToya Cantrell, the mayor of New Orleans, even showed up at the Boycott Bowl concert. A number of Saints fans have filed long-shot lawsuits against the N.F.L.The local newspaper, The Times-Picayune, got in on the fun too. “Super Bowl? What Super Bowl?” asked the front page of Monday’s edition, which was otherwise blank. A former Saints running back, Pierre Thomas, certainly agreed, tweeting approvingly that the front page was “championship level petty.”Fans in Kansas City, whose Chiefs lost to the Patriots in the A.F.C. championship game, were also turned off, though not nearly to the same extent. Super Bowl ratings in Kansas City were down 11 percent compared to last year.The Super Bowl’s smaller viewership ran counter to the success the N.F.L. had on television this season. Every time slot for N.F.L. game earned higher ratings during the 2018 regular season, a total gain of 5 percent.The regular season pointing one way and the Super Bowl pointing another isn’t necessarily unusual. Both the 2017 and 2018 Super Bowls suffered modest overnight ratings declines from the previous Super Bowl, but they were smaller than the major viewership declines the N.F.L. suffered during both of those regular seasons.There was also some unknown number of people who boycotted the game because of what they view as the unfair treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has not been able to land even a backup job with an N.F.L. team the past two seasons. Kaepernick became a controversial figure in 2016 when he began kneeling during the national anthem to bring attention to police brutality and other issues affecting minorities and economically disadvantaged people in America.Despite the fourth straight year of a viewership decline, the Super Bowl will almost assuredly be the year’s most-watched program, boasting tens of millions more viewers than anything else on television. In a fragmenting market and amid declining audiences for traditional television across the board, football remains king. In 2018, 46 of the top 50 most watched telecasts were N.F.L. games."
"When the Whole Country Reviews a Play, Referees Can’t Always Join - The New York Times
More than 50 cameras blanketed the Superdome on Sunday afternoon, ensuring endless angles and replays of every highlight from the N.F.C. championship game between the New Orleans Saints and Los Angeles Rams.At stake was a trip to next month’s Super Bowl, but when the officials needed a replay most, the N.F.L.’s complicated rules for what is and is not subject to video review prohibited them from watching one, even in the midst of a game that cost tens of millions of dollars to produce and is among the most watched events on television.So, despite dizzying rules changes and stunning camera angles all aimed at getting the calls right, the decision came down to a simple fact: The most important guy was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and nobody could do anything about it.Those rules might change this off-season, though in the past the N.F.L. has shown little appetite for making penalties reviewable because they are considered judgment calls. This means that rulings of fact — such as whether a ball crossed the goal line, or a foot touched the sideline, or whether a pass is complete — are reviewable. Whether a player committed holding or pass interference is not.In the minute after a crucial late-game play on which referees could have called two separate penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman but opted to call none, Fox’s broadcast team showed five separate replays that made clear officials had made a terrible mistake. It appeared to cost the Saints an advantage that could have led to their winning the game. As those replays rolled, the side judge Gary Cavaletto, who was near the play, endured an earful from Saints Coach Sean Payton.However, in an era when anyone watching on a high-definition television at home has as good a view as the officials on the field do, as well as the benefit of reverse angles and slow motion for each play, the harsh judgment of the world most often ends up carrying the day: The official screwed up.The Saints owner Gayle Benson rendered her judgment in an emotional statement issued late Monday afternoon, vowing to make sure no team ever experiences what hers did Sunday.“I have been in touch with the N.F.L. regarding yesterday’s events and will aggressively pursue changes in N.F.L. policies to ensure no team and fan base is ever put in a similar position again,” Benson said. “The N.F.L. must always commit to providing the most basic of expectations — fairness and integrity.”The league declined to issue a statement about what will undoubtedly become one of the most notorious non-calls in the league’s history. An N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, also declined to comment when asked about the play. The head official for the game, Bill Vinovich, told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play, pointing out that plays involving potential pass interference are not reviewable.The closest thing to an official league position came from Payton, the Saints’ head coach. After the game, he said he had spoken on the phone with Alberto Riveron, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of officiating, who told him the officials botched the call, a position the league chose not to refute.While the relative silence may seem odd in the age of very public apologies and mea culpas, the N.F.L. actually has no consistent strategy for dealing with high-profile officiating errors, a reflection of what is often an idiosyncratic approach to crisis management. Sometimes Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, chooses to say plenty; other times he says nothing at all.When it comes to major officiating mistakes, oftentimes what happened does not become clear until years later, when the official involved chooses to speak.Bill Leavy can’t forget Super Bowl XL. As an N.F.L. referee, officiating the biggest game of the season should have been an honor for Leavy. Instead, it is the night he will always remember for all the wrong reasons.Leavy and his crew made several controversial calls that went against the Seattle Seahawks, who ended up losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers by 21-10. The league tried to protect Leavy’s crew when it said the game was “properly officiated.”Years later, Leavy acknowledged the missed calls and said they still weighed on him.“It left me with a lot of sleepless nights, and I think about it constantly,” Leavy told reporters in Seattle in 2010, four years after the game. “I’ll go to my grave wishing that I’d been better.”Video replay was supposed to rectify much of that. The former N.F.L. coach Mike Holmgren refers to it as the “50 guys in a bar” rule. If 50 people watching in a bar agree it’s a bad call, it should probably be overturned. Yet, like a lot of things that happen in the N.F.L., which has a dense, 89-page rule book, it is never that simple.Cavaletto might want to heed Leavy’s remorse. Cavaletto, the side judge in the N.F.C. championship game on Sunday, has been widely ridiculed for not calling a penalty late in the fourth quarter on Robey-Coleman, who drilled New Orleans Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis before the ball arrived.Cavaletto, who did not grant an interview, and the other referees could have called penalties for pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet hit, but they chose to call neither.The Saints settled for a field goal, but enough time remained on the clock for the Rams to march down the field and kick a field goal that sent the game into overtime. The Rams ended up winning the game, 26-23.“It was simple: They blew the call,” Payton said after the game.Cavaletto, 63, spent most of his N.F.L. career as a field judge before becoming a sideline judge before the 2014 season. He worked Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, between the Giants and New England Patriots.He is a 1973 graduate of Bishop Diego High School in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he played football, baseball and basketball. Cavaletto later played parts of three seasons in the Atlanta Braves minor league system, as a first baseman.After washing out of baseball, Cavaletto became a three-sport official, officiating Division I college basketball and baseball games, as well as Canadian Football League and Arena Football League games, before making his N.F.L. debut in 2003.He, too, will most likely live with his non-call for years to come.In the past, officials involved in controversial calls have not worked subsequent games involving the aggrieved team. It is a good bet, then, that Cavaletto will not be seen at future Saints games.Infuriated Saints fans, who have long insisted that the N.F.L. remains biased against them because its coaches were found to have rewarded injuring opponents, took to social media after the game to note that Cavaletto lives a mere two hours from Los Angeles.His non-call may also lead to change.That is, after all, what happened after a series of mistakes involving the N.F.L.’s so-called “tuck rule.”The most famous invocation of that rule came during a playoff game in 2002, when a fumble by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass after a replay review by the referee Walt Coleman. Brady’s arm, Coleman ruled, had begun a forward movement before he attempted to tuck the ball back toward his body. The Patriots went on to defeat the Oakland Raiders in overtime.While the N.F.L. elected to leave the rule as-is following that game, a push to make a change began in earnest after another instance in a 2011 playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Kansas City Chiefs. Finally, in 2013, after continued consternation over the regulation, the N.F.L. abolished the tuck rule.Even though Coleman officiated for 17 seasons after the game before retiring this year, he never officiated another Raiders game."
"In the Din of the Dome, the Rams Beat the Saints in Overtime - The New York Times
The triumphant locker room at the Super Dome started out so crowded Sunday night that personal space seemed like an extravagance. But as the room emptied, and the jubilant Los Angeles Rams continued a celebration that would rival any bacchanalia in this city’s French Quarter, the player who helped preserve their season by blatantly breaking the rules stood in the middle of it all, still in full uniform, delighted to answer question after question about his fateful, and fortunate, moment.Amid the mayhem after a 26-23 overtime victory that propelled the Rams past the Saints and into the Super Bowl, that player, cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, got his first look at the replay of his helmet-to-helmet, fourth-quarter thump on New Orleans receiver Tommylee Lewis. Peering at a reporter’s cell phone, he could see himself slide into view and clobber Lewis before the pass arrived.For Robey-Coleman, it was just visual confirmation for what he already knew — he had been guilty of pass interference on Lewis and somehow had gotten away with it.“I felt more than lucky,” Robey-Coleman said, when asked how he felt when no penalty was called, allowing the Rams to stay within 3 points when the Saints were forced to kick a field goal rather than go for a touchdown. “I felt blessed.”The repercussions of that play will be felt everywhere from the league office, which acknowledged to New Orleans Coach Sean Payton afterward that the officiating crew botched the call, to this mystical city, which will now mourn a second consecutive infuriating exit from the postseason for their beloved Saints. Just 53 weeks ago, the Saints lost in the divisional round of the playoffs when Minnesota scored on a last-second, 61-yard touchdown — nearly the same distance as Greg Zuerlein’s 57-yard field goal that doomed them on Sunday.But in the giddy aftermath of Sunday’s game, the missed call maybe resonated even deeper for a Los Angeles franchise that went 4-12 two seasons ago after relocating to Southern California from St. Louis and entrusted a 30-year-old coaching prodigy, Sean McVay, to return the Rams to prominence. And now, on the 39-year anniversary of their only Super Bowl appearance as a Los Angeles franchise, the Rams have advanced there for the second time.“We walked into the interview saying, ‘How on earth could we hire a 30-year-old? We walked out of the interview saying, ‘How could we not hire Sean McVay?” the Rams’ chief operating officer, Kevin Demoff, said in recalling the decision to hire McVay.“He’s a great football coach,’’ Demoff added. “He’s not a quarterback whisperer. He’s not an offensive genius. Today he found a great way for our team to play complementary football. We kicked two field goals to go to the Super Bowl.”In one night, the Rams vindicated two off-seasons’ worth of bold personnel moves intended to turn a middling team from St. Louis into a champion in Los Angeles. Having pierced the aura of the Superdome, where Payton and quarterback Drew Brees had won their previous six playoff games, the Rams will now face New England on Feb. 3 in Atlanta.It is not a surprise that the Patriots – who also advanced with an overtime victory, by 37-31 at top-seeded Kansas City – will be there. They always are. But the Rams have gotten this far because, at bottom, every move they made after losing to Atlanta in the playoffs last year, all the off-season splurges and in-season roster churn, positioned them to thrive amid the jackhammer-in-your-ear din that they confronted on Sunday in the Superdome.“We didn’t feel pressure,” said cornerback Aqib Talib, one of several new players on the Rams’ revamped defense. “We applied it.”This N.F.C. title-game matchup registered somewhere between sunrise and sunset on the inevitability scale. Since September, New Orleans and Los Angeles had jockeyed for the conference’s top seed, with one coaching mastermind named Sean striving to duplicate the success of another. No other matchup embodied the season’s offensive boom better than having the conference’s most prolific teams — who combined for 80 points in the Saints’ Week 9 home victory over the Rams — vying to outscore each other for a second time.On Sunday, a full quarter elapsed before the Rams looked comfortable — or, at least, they no longer looked sleeping-above-an-alligator-pit uncomfortable — and then gradually, they chiseled away at the Saints’ lead. They trailed by 13 after the first quarter but by just 3 at halftime and ultimately tied the score, at 20-20, on Zuerlein’s 24-yarder with 5:03 left in the game.The other day in the Saints’ cafeteria, Brees, newly 40, glanced up and saw himself on television. The channel was showing the N.F.C. championship game from 2010, the last time New Orleans played in the Super Bowl. His teammates ribbed him about all the hair he had nine years ago, all the hair he seems to have lost.Seizing the chance Sunday to lead them to another, Brees drove the Saints to the Rams’ 13. On third-and-10, Lewis scooted out of the backfield and ran a wheel route. Brees saw him and released a pass down the near sideline — the Saints’ sideline — toward Lewis, who was now inside the 5-yard line. The ball never reached him. Robey-Coleman made certain of that.The officiating crew, which could have called any number of penalties on the play — pass interference and unnecessary roughness among them — opted to call none. The referee, Bill Vinovich, told a pool reporter that he “personally” had not seen what occurred.The Saints protested. Payton ranted and screamed. The public-address announcer admonished fans not to throw debris onto the field. Instead of scoring a touchdown or draining time off the clock, the Saints settled for Wil Lutz’s 31-yard field goal that put them ahead by 23-20.“It was simple: They blew the call,” Payton said.For the Rams and for Jared Goff, the quarterback who blossomed under McVay’s tutelage and became one of the best in the league, 101 seconds remained to tie or even win the game. Goff, who overcame a first-quarter interception to complete 25 of 40 passes for 297 yards and a touchdown, proceeded to direct the Rams into field-goal range, and Zuerlein equalized from 48 yards with just 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter.After winning the overtime coin toss, knowing that a touchdown would win the game but a field goal would return the ball to the Rams, New Orleans faced a 2nd-and-16 at its 34. Charging on a stunt, Rams linebacker Dante Fowler, acquired from Jacksonville by the trade deadline, reached Brees and hit him in the wrist as he threw, causing his pass to float. Safety John Johnson, defending Michael Thomas, watched the ball reach its apex from his back. He barely moved as he intercepted it.“I saw it the whole way,” Johnson said. “I’m glad I got my contacts in. I probably would have dropped it if I didn’t.”Goff ran back onto the field, the Rams with the ball at their own 46, five plays from deliverance, and General Manager Les Snead said it all felt akin to climbing the 18th green at Augusta National Golf Club.“The hole gets smaller,” Snead said.Demoff harked back to a conversation he had with Goff after that miserable 2016 season, when he lost all seven of his starts. Goff told him that he knew how to turn around the franchise since, he said, he had done it in college, at Berkeley. “I know we’re not that far,” Goff told him at the time, and indeed the Rams weren’t.They won a second consecutive N.F.C. West title this season. They beat Dallas last week, and when Zuerlein went on to kick his 57-yarder, they had conquered New Orleans as well. The fact that the referees helped the Rams, too, won’t make them any less proud.“The referee made the call, we respect it,” Robey-Coleman said. “Now I’m going to the Super Bowl. Nobody can change that.”— Ben Shpigel[The New England Patriots beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 37-31, in the A.F.C. championship game Sunday, and will face the winner of this game in the Super Bowl. See how they did it here.]Here’s how the Rams beat the Saints:He’s known as Greg the Leg for a reason.A 57-yard kick by Zuerlein has sent the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2001. What a turnaround by Goff and the Rams, who trailed by 13 in an incredibly loud and hostile stadium, and largely orchestrated that comeback without their Pro Bowl running back, Todd Gurley.— Zach SchonbrunAnd the most accurate quarterback in N.F.L. history is picked off in overtime.Brees’s arm was hit as he threw, leaving a ball that hung in the air. Rams defender John Johnson came down with the interception as he was falling down on his back in Saints’ territory. Los Angeles can now win it with a field goal.— Zach SchonbrunHello, overtime. The Rams got down to the 31 yard line, but the Saints defense held firm, and a 48-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein tied the game with 19 seconds left. The Saints elected to kneel it to send it to the extra period.But that no-call on the Lewis play on the last drive continues to look worse and worse. Saints Coach Sean Payton is still pleading his case to the referees and the fans are still booing. Hard to believe.— Zach SchonbrunSaints settle for a field goal to take a 23-20 lead and give the Rams back the ball with 1 minute 41 seconds left and one timeout. But the Saints and the fans were upset that Rams cornerback Robey-Coleman hit Tommylee Lewis early on a pass out in the flat. Both players went up for the ball, but Coleman connected with Lewis before the ball touched him. Fans are booing and, from replay, it certainly looked like the flag should have been thrown there. That could have ended the game because the Saints could have run down the clock before kicking a field goal. Once again, an N.F.L. playoff game could be decided by the referees.— Zach SchonbrunYou just knew the Saints were going to try to take a shot downfield at some point. They've been thriving on their usual mix of underneath passes and creative screens, but, with time ticking down to the two-minute warning, Brees finally uncorked a bomb to Ted Ginn Jr., who out-leaped the safety Lamarcus Joyner for the ball 43 yards downfield. The Saints are now in the red zone with three timeouts and less than two minutes left.— Zach SchonbrunAfter trailing 13-0, the Rams have climbed back to tie it with just about five minutes remaining. After starting the drive on their own 9-yard line, Goff drove his team all the way down the field, and a rush by C.J. Anderson was stopped on the 1-yard line. Rams Coach Sean McVay likes to be aggressive, but going for it on fourth down and passing up the chance to tie was a bit too risky even for him. So after a field goal, we are all even.— Zach SchonbrunThat was a huge series for the Saints defense, which forced the Rams to punt from their own 12-yard line — and just when the Rams looked to be seizing momentum (again). Add in a personal foul against the Rams on the punt, and the Saints will take over at the Rams' 46.— Scott CacciolaRams continue to gash the Saints for big yardage plays, just as they did against the Dallas Cowboys last week. Brandin Cooks now has 100 yards receiving after a 25-yard catch and run. An end around by Josh Reynolds then went for 16 yards all the way to the 1-yard line, setting up a touchdown pass to Tyler Higbee to make it 20-17. After the score, Higbee immediately put his finger to his lips. Shhhhhhhh. (Don't think the Saints fans will listen, though).— Zach SchonbrunSo much for the Rams’ momentum. After they went three-and-out on their opening series of the second half, the Saints took over and marched down the field. Their 12-play, 71-yard drive culminated in a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brees to Taysom Hill, the team’s third-string quarterback. (!) But really, that drive was all about Alvin Kamara, the Saints’ do-everything tailback. Kamara caught four passes for 34 yards and ran once for 6 yards, sparking New Orleans — and the crowd is once again in a tizzy.— Scott CacciolaDon't count the Rams out yet. They turned up the defensive pressure on Brees, sacking him on consecutive plays. Then two big throws by Jared Goff to Brandin Cooks — including a beautiful 31-yard completion to the 6-yard line — have put the Rams right back in it. A touchdown run by Gurley (remember him?) makes it a 13-10 game at halftime.— Zach SchonbrunThat series was the best possible sequence of events for the Rams. Not only did Gurley get involved with the touchdown run — welcome back, Todd — but the Rams also absolutely silenced the crowd before halftime. And don't forget: The Rams will get the ball to start the second half.— Scott CacciolaSomething to watch: The Rams have gone away from Todd Gurley, their All-Pro running back, since that early pass that wound up being an interception slipped through his hands. C.J. Anderson, signed late in the regular season when Gurley was sidelined with a knee injury, has been getting the bulk of the carries in his place. Anderson and Gurley were both terrific last weekend in the Rams' divisional-round victory over the Dallas Cowboys.— Scott CacciolaSpecial teams are already a factor in this game, which features two of the best and most creative units in the league.On the Rams’ last drive, Coach Sean McVay made the gutsy call to fake the punt and throw a pass on 4th and 5, which finally gave the Rams some offensive momentum. (The result was a field goal to get on the board, 13-3).On the other side, the Saints’ special teams were the most efficient in the N.F.L. this season, led by the well-respected Mike Westhoff. And they love to employ Taysom Hill in innovative ways.— Zach SchonbrunIf there's one word to sum this game up so far, it might be noise. It is so loud inside this building. And just to give Saints fans a friendly nudge, the game operations department here keeps flashing a giant ""MAKE NOISE"" sign on the Jumbotron, with flames licking all the letters. Noise, of course, is part of the strategy. Veterans in the press box who have been to many sports events here at the Superdome are saying this is the loudest they've heard it — and the noise is clearly affecting the Rams. Jared Goff had the experience of playing against the Saints here earlier this season, but suffice it to say the atmosphere was slightly more muted back in November than it is today.— Scott CacciolaFifteen. That's the total yardage for the Rams in the first quarter, their lowest total for a quarter this season. That does not include a single first down. And they're facing another third down when the second quarter begins. More alarming: The crowd noise at the Superdome caused the Rams to commit a false start AFTER they had just called a timeout … because of the crowd noise.— Zach SchonbrunIt’s starting to look like a nightmarish start for the Rams in New Orleans.In the red zone for a third time already in the first quarter, the Saints brought their do-everything backup quarterback Taysom Hill in on third down but could not convert the run-pass option play. No matter: New Orleans brought Brees back onto the field on 4th and 2 from the 10-yard line, and he got the Rams to jump offside.On the next play, two Rams defenders ran into each other, and Brees found Garrett Griffin wide open in the end zone. 13-0 New Orleans.Los Angeles looks completely out of sorts on defense. But the Saints have that effect on a lot of teams.— Zach SchonbrunIt’s probably worth noting the colossal difference in time of possession here so far: While the Rams have had the ball for a grand total of 3 minutes 9 seconds, the Saints have had it for 10:16. The Rams’ defense is already working hard, and probably did well to limit the Saints to two field goals on their first two series. Goff and his offense could do the defense a huge favor by keeping the ball here for more than another three-and-out.— Scott CacciolaOn the N.F.L.'s radio broadcast, they are reporting that Rams quarterback Jared Goff was having problems with the audio inside his helmet, meaning he couldn't hear Coach Sean McVay. The Rams are hoping that the issue is resolved.— Scott CacciolaOh boy. New Orleans forces a turnover as a dropped pass by Todd Gurley goes right into the arms of Saints linebacker Demario Davis on the Rams' own 16-yard line. It was L.A.'s first turnover in three games, and it gives New Orleans a chance to take a commanding early start.— Zach SchonbrunIt did not take long for Drew Brees to make a little history. With his third completion of the Saints’ opening drive, he passed the great Dan Marino for sixth on the all-time postseason completions list with 385. Incidentally, the Rams made an unusual decision to defer after winning the coin toss, giving the Saints the ball to start — a small gamble when Brees is the opposing quarterback and this crowd is fired up. (The kids might refer to the Superdome as “lit.”) All things considered the Rams were fortunate to get off the field after giving up just a field goal.— Scott CacciolaThe last time the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints met, they combined for 80 points and 970 yards of offense, and the Saints ended the Rams’ dreams of going undefeated the entire season.Here is what to know now:"
"Klopp, Guardiola Would Back Players Leaving Pitch Over Racist Abuse - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Juergen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are both willing to halt matches if players are subject to racist abuse, the like of which experienced by some England players in Montenegro this week.UEFA have opened an investigation after England players Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi said they were victims of the abuse during their 5-1 win in Podgorica.Liverpool manager Klopp believes a walk off because of a minority of supporters would give ""too much power for one or two idiots"", but said the decision should be down to match officials if abuse escalated.""If it's the whole stand I would do it, 100 percent,"" Klopp told reporters ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash against Tottenham Hotspur.""But it's too much power for one or two idiots. We have to find ways to punish these incidents.""It's not that the coaches should do that - match officials - because if I take the players off and they say it was not that serious, you lose the game, our job is to win football games.""Guardiola is also in favour of taking his Manchester City players off the pitch, adding football should try and set an example for action against racism.""We could do that (walk off),"" the Spaniard added. ""Football is a strong weapon to defend the principles of humanity. People said you can't mix football and politics but that's not true.""It's not a football problem, it's society itself. I think in Europe, not in football, it's getting worse.""The Football Association Board met on Thursday to discuss the incidents in Montenegro and called on a structured campaign within UEFA and FIFA to ensure that incidents such as this are dealt with appropriately.The Board also agreed that there should be more transparency on FA charges going forward when clubs are found to be in breach of the rules following such incidents in the domestic game.Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, meanwhile, wants the sport's governing bodies to introduce clear guidelines to stop matches in order to combat racist abuse.""We need a rule, I think. A rule for the Premier League, but for all the championships across football. A rule that can permit us to stop the match,"" Sarri said.

"Robert Kraft Facing First-Degree Misdemeanors in Prostitution Case - The New York Times
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Three weeks and a day after he watched his team win its sixth Super Bowl championship, Robert K. Kraft was formally charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution.Mr. Kraft, who lives in Massachusetts but has owned property in Palm Beach, Fla., for a number of years, was one of 25 men caught in a sting operation at a spa called Orchids of Asia, a small storefront business in a strip mall in Jupiter, Fla.On Friday, Jupiter police filed two second-degree charges against Mr. Kraft, but State Attorney Dave Aronberg of Palm Beach County increased the severity of the charges to two first-degree misdemeanors. If convicted, Mr. Kraft could face up to a year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service, Mr. Aronberg said. He added that it was unlikely a first-time offender would spend time in jail.“Human trafficking is evil in our midst,” Mr. Aronberg said. “It is fueled on the demand side.”The charges are the latest crisis for the Patriots and Mr. Kraft, who is one of the N.F.L.’s most powerful owners, a trustee emeritus and longtime benefactor of Columbia University and a friend of President Trump’s. Mr. Aronberg made it clear that Mr. Kraft would not receive special treatment because of his prominence.“Our office treats everyone the same, whether you have a lot of money or are indigent,” Mr. Aronberg said. “No one gets special treatment in Palm Beach County.”The N.F.L., which will have to consider a punishment for Mr. Kraft, released a statement expressing the same sentiment Monday morning.“Our Personal Conduct Policy applies equally to everyone in the N.F.L.,” the unsigned league statement read. “We will handle this allegation in the same way we would handle any issue under the policy. We are seeking a full understanding of the facts, while ensuring that we do not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation. We will take appropriate action as warranted based on the facts.”Through the Patriots, Mr. Kraft has denied engaging in illegal activity. A team spokesman said on Monday that the Patriots would not comment on the new charges.Mr. Aronberg said that because Mr. Kraft was considered a local resident, he had received a summons in the mail. He will not be booked into the local jail or appear in a mug shot. His lawyer can appear on his behalf in court.Details of the case against Mr. Kraft emerged Monday through an affidavit, which described his two visits to the spa that were caught on video.According to the affidavit, one of Mr. Kraft’s visits occurred in the late afternoon of Jan. 19, a Saturday. He arrived in a 2014 white, chauffeur-driven Bentley, and he was wearing a blue shirt and ball cap, the affidavit said. He spent about 40 minutes at the spa, during which time he undressed and lay on his back on a massage table as a woman massaged his genitals.As Mr. Kraft left the spa, the police followed the car, pulling it over in what was described as a traffic stop, and identified the owner of the Patriots.The next day, hours before the start of the A.F.C. championship game, Kraft arrived at the spa just before 11 a.m. He entered the room and hugged a masseuse. Once again, a woman was observed with her hands on his genitals, according to the affidavit, and then she was seen placing her head close to his pelvic area. The woman helped him get dressed. Mr. Kraft hugged her and gave her a $100 bill and another, unidentifiable form of currency. He was on his way 14 minutes after he arrived.Mr. Kraft later traveled to Kansas City, where he watched the Patriots defeat the Chiefs to earn their third consecutive trip to the Super Bowl.“This is not about lonely old men or victimless crime,” Mr. Aronberg said. “This is about enabling a network of criminals to traffic women into our country for forced labor and sex.”On Friday, the Jupiter police announced the charges, the result of an investigation into human trafficking that involved multiple agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. None of the men charged in the sting have been accused of being involved with human trafficking.Mr. Kraft is a member of the league’s powerful broadcast committee, as well as the compensation committee, which sets Commissioner Roger Goodell’s salary. Mr. Goodell, who has striven to convince fans that the N.F.L. is a female-friendly organization after several high-profile incidents of domestic violence involving players, now could be in a position to fine or suspend Mr. Kraft for his conduct.The N.F.L. gives Mr. Goodell broad authority to hold players and owners accountable for conduct he deems detrimental to the league. Previous punishments have included fines and suspensions, but also prohibitions that have barred owners from being at their team facilities or from attending games.The N.F.L. maintains a “reserve/commissioner exempt list” for players who are being investigated by the league for conduct violations. This is the list that Kareem Hunt, the former Kansas City Chiefs running back, landed on after video emerged of him pushing and kicking a woman. (The Chiefs cut him shortly after the video became public and the league put Hunt on the exempt list; Hunt signed with the Cleveland Browns this month, though he has not yet been cleared to play.)Players on the exempt list cannot practice or attend games, but they continue to be paid. It is not clear whether Mr. Goodell would suspend an owner pending the outcome of an investigation.Mr. Goodell is hired and paid by the owners, making his decision on potential discipline for Mr. Kraft a tricky one.Mr. Kraft and Mr. Goodell had been considered longtime allies. Their relationship was strained, however, by two earlier punishments for the Patriots: when Mr. Goodell disciplined the franchise for spying on other teams in 2007, and when he penalized the team and quarterback Tom Brady in a case that began in 2015 about deflating footballs for a competitive advantage.The team came under larger scrutiny when one of its players, Aaron Hernandez, was charged with first-degree murder. He was convicted in 2015, and he killed himself in his cell in 2017."
"From the Motorway to the Bernabeu, Gallego Relishing Late Arrival in La Liga - The New York Times
BARCELONA — Playing against Real Madrid seemed like a pipe dream for Enric Gallego when he was driving a delivery truck to support his amateur football career but on Sunday that fantasy will become a reality for the Huesca striker.When the 32-year-old steps on to the Santiago Bernabeu turf for the first time to face the likes of Sergio Ramos, Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, it will cap a remarkable turnaround for the Catalan forward who has scaled the Spanish football pyramid from third tier to La Liga in under a year.Gallego thought he had missed the chance to play Madrid when his former side Cornella drew them in the Copa del Rey the year after he left.""My (former) team mates got to play at the Bernabeu but I missed out. Now it's my turn and I'm going to enjoy it as much as I can,"" he told Reuters in an interview.""What happened for whatever reason had to happen for me to get to this stage and I wouldn't change anything.""Gallego grew up on the outskirts of Barcelona, playing with former Spain international Sergio Garcia but followed a very different path.Aged 18, Gallego's youth team were thrown out of their league after a brawl on the pitch and he went a year without playing organised football. The striker later moved around Catalan regional teams and had a brief spell at Espanyol's B team, working a variety of jobs.After narrowly avoiding a road accident while driving a truck, he chose to work for a bicycle hire company before deciding to focus exclusively on football.""Everyone in professional football values work, they have parents, sisters and brothers who work, but having lived what I've lived perhaps I appreciate everything a little bit more,"" he said.Gallego made a name for himself with a hot streak of 18 goals in the first half of the 2017/18 season while at Cornella, which led to him switching to high-flying Extremadura.He helped his new side to win promotion and began to thrive in the second tier of Spanish soccer, scoring 15 goals in under four months.Gallego was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight and Huesca, in serious trouble in their first season in La Liga, came calling.""Many people played at a very high level in youth football then for various reasons they never hit the level they expected,"" he said. ""I always trained the same, I was in the same league for many years but then I got an opportunity and I made the most of it.""VARDY COMPARISONGallego is now being compared to other late bloomers, such as Athletic Bilbao's Aritz Aduriz, 38, and 36-year-old Jorge Molina, who is helping Getafe's push for Champions League qualification.There are also parallels with Jamie Vardy, who worked as a technician making medical splints in a factory while he played amateur football before he capped a magical season with Leicester City by winning the Premier League title in 2016.""Each year I feel more comfortable out on the pitch and physically. And when you see players like Aduriz and Molina who are performing so well at this age it encourages you to give yourself that extra push,"" he said.""If what has happened to me can be an example to other players and motivate them to keep working to take that step up in their own careers, then that's even better."" Having done his time in the lower leagues, Gallego is determined to extend his stay in the elite by helping Huesca's mammoth task of staying in the top flight.Bottom placed Huesca had won two of 19 games before signing Gallego in January. With him in the side they have won three and drawn two of their last nine, moving to within seven points of escaping the relegation zone with 10 games left.""It will be a long journey but the way we are going and if we keep pulling together we can do it,"" Gallego added. ""Playing in La Liga for half a year is lovely but I didn't come here for that, I always want more so the next step is to avoid relegation with Huesca and enjoy a full year in La Liga.""

"On Way to Super Bowl, the Patriots Moved the Ball and the Line - The New York Times
As another N.F.L. season winds to a close, the New England Patriots find themselves in a familiar position: favorites in the Super Bowl. But it wasn’t certain they would hold the honor until nearly the last minute.For much of the season, the Patriots were considered a tier below the best teams; for months, that group included the Saints, the Chiefs and the Rams. Throughout the season, bookmakers offering early Super Bowl wagering made the N.F.C. entrant — whomever it turned out to be — a 3-point favorite over a generic A.F.C. representative.As the big game got closer, however, oddsmakers began offering odds on hypothetical Super Bowl matchups. The Rams were generally listed as a 1-point favorite over the Patriots as recently as a week ago.Then the teams played their conference championship game.“Everything is about public perception: What have you done for me lately?” said Scott Cooley, a spokesman for the online gambling site BetDSI. “As we saw the Rams game unfold, they were down the entire game, they benefited from an egregious miscall. Maybe this team is not as strong as we thought they were.“The Patriots were dominant on the road over a Chiefs squad that was favored. The manner in which the last two quarters unfolded: marching down the field and scoring in overtime — the Rams won in less convincing fashion.”Immediately after the Super Bowl matchup was confirmed, many bookmakers made Rams-Patriots a pick ’em game. Bettors reacted quickly.""We opened at even,” said Marco Blume, trading director at Pinnacle Sports. “Then the action came almost immediately on the Patriots.” All that action has led Pinnacle to recalculate, and make the Patriots a 2-point favorite.“We know the Patriots are a public team,” Cooley said. “They are always going to be wagered on by the Average Joe bettor. The Patriots, the Cowboys, the Packers. They are going to blindly bet on those teams.”Cooley identified the key moment when the Patriots started gaining respect as the divisional round against the Chargers. “Smart pro bettors were betting the Chargers, though the public still liked the Patriots,” he said. “The spread went from Patriots by 5, down to 3½. And the Pats crushed them.”At that point, casual fans and smart bettors alike started to realize that “this isn’t a feeble Patriots team,” Cooley said. “Maybe Gronk isn’t doing the damage he once did, but you’d be hard-pressed to bet against them.”Could the line, now 2 at most places, keep moving to Patriots by 3 or even 4 by a week from Sunday? Probably not, several bookmakers said.“We’re going to reach peak on the Patriots soon,” Blume said. “Sharp customers may look to get a bargain on the Rams. People are waiting. The sharps have a number in their heads, and as soon as they see a chance, they will pounce on you.”The Patriots’ current status as 2-point favorites defies computer rankings, though, which are the basis of most lines. In Jeff Sagarin’s main ranking, the Patriots are a mere four-hundredths of a point better than the Rams. In his Predictor rating, in which many bettors put even more stock, the Rams are actually a half-point better.But the bets keep coming in on New England.“People love Tom Brady,” Blume said.It wasn’t always this way. In the first Super Bowl of the Brady era, in February 2002, the Patriots were 14-point underdogs to the 14-2 St. Louis Rams. The Patriots won anyway.Bettors learned. The Patriots have been Super Bowl favorites six times in seven games since then, ranging from 2½ points to 12. In one game, against the Seahawks after the 2014 season, the line was even. The Pats won four of those seven games, but covered the spread in only two of them.Regardless of who wins on Feb. 3 in Atlanta, one thing seems sure: Points will be scored.The over-under on the game is between 57 and 58, potentially the highest in Super Bowl history. The previous record was 57, for Atlanta-New England two years ago and New Orleans-Indianapolis in 2010.Thanks to rule changes designed to protect players, the trend in football has been toward higher scoring games; over-unders in the 1960s were generally in the 30s. But that is not the only factor. Both of this year’s teams are seen as offensive powerhouses with slightly suspect defenses.“If it was Bears-Ravens, we’d have a total in the 40s,” Cooley said.Don’t expect a move into the 60s, however. Blume suggested it had topped out already. “I expect it to close a little bit lower,” he said."
"Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Big Boi Will Play Super Bowl Halftime - The New York Times
The N.F.L. on Sunday ended months of uncertainty by officially announcing Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi as the lineup for this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.In an indication of how fraught the debate around the high-profile performance has become, Scott released a statement on Sunday announcing that he and the N.F.L. will partner on a $500,000 donation to the social justice group Dream Corps — a move that seemed to be aimed at stemming a backlash from groups that have criticized the football league’s policies.Sources familiar with the N.F.L.’s Super Bowl plans had confirmed the rock band Maroon 5 as the headliner as long ago as September, and Scott emerged last month as a reported addition to the Feb. 3 halftime performance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Big Boi, the newest name on the bill, is a member of the Atlanta rap group Outkast.But the run-up to this year’s halftime announcement had turned into a skirmish over sports and politics, as artists and others criticized the N.F.L. over its treatment of Colin Kaepernick and other players who have taken a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice.In February, the rapper Cardi B, who was featured on Maroon 5’s hit “Girls Like You” last year, told the celebrity news website TMZ that she would consider performing at a halftime show “when they hire Colin Kaepernick back.”In a song released last June, Jay-Z rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.”Scott’s involvement, specifically, has prompted criticism from some. In an interview with TMZ, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he thought Scott “should do what a lot of other major artists have done — say, ‘I’m not going to participate.’”“You can’t fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus,” he added.In a pair of tweets, the rapper Meek Mill responded to the news that Scott would be performing with, “For what????” and “He don’t need that he on fire already!”And Gerald Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., told The Guardian that the chapter had contacted artists and asked them not to perform. “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the N.F.L.,” Griggs said. “They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr. Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.”For his part, Van Jones, the president of Dream Corps and a founder of the group, celebrated the announcement in a post on Twitter, addressing Scott by his handle.“This is great news!” Jones wrote. “Welcome, @trvisXX. Glad to have you with us, brother!”"
"Robert Kraft Awaits Your Judgment: ‘I Am Truly Sorry’ - The New York Times
When you find yourself at 77 a billionaire six times over and an N.F.L. team owner practically running out of fingers for Super Bowl rings, there aren’t a ton of opportunities you haven’t already enjoyed. Private jets are your subways. Weekends with pals at $2,000-a-night island resorts are your backyard barbecues. The question “what to do for kicks?” becomes harder to answer.That may be why Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, ended up on stage with Cardi B before Super Bowl LIII last month.Mr. Kraft was at the pregame party hosted by Michael G. Rubin, the 46-year-old owner of Fanatics, the online sports merchandise company, and an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.Cardi B was performing “Money.” (It goes: “I like boardin’ jets, I like mornin’ sex, but nothing in this world that I like more than checks.”) “Get out there and dance,” said Meek Mill, just off the stage, to Mr. Rubin and Mr. Kraft.Mr. Rubin backed away. But Mr. Kraft, dressed in black and his signature Nike Air Force One sneakers, began to bust out some steps.“He was moving more than I thought he could move,” Meek Mill said later. The video spread around the web.It was about three weeks later, though, that news about Mr. Kraft really went viral. On Feb. 22, Mr. Kraft was charged with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting sex at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. He pleaded not guilty.[Read more: Despite charges, Trump wants Robert Kraft at Super Bowl celebration.]On Tuesday, prosecutors made an offer to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men facing charges: a fine and community service in return for admitting that if their cases were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win.And on Wednesday, lawyers for Mr. Kraft and 14 other men filed a motion to prevent evidence in the case from being made public, including hidden camera video of the men at the massage parlor. As of Friday, Mr. Kraft, who declined to comment for this article, refused to sign the proposed deal.And on Saturday, he released a statement. “I am truly sorry. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard,” it said, in part. “Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women; my morals and my soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years.”The Kraft camp is very sensitive to the inferences that Mr. Kraft’s solicitation charges have anything to do with what prosecutors say is a larger investigation into sex trafficking. All told, dozens of men have been charged with soliciting prostitution.“We have looked into it, we’ve looked at the charges brought, looked at the evidence, and there is zero evidence of human trafficking,” said William Burck, one of his attorneys.The operators of the Jupiter spa have not been charged with sex trafficking; the women Mr. Kraft is accused of soliciting are 45 and 58 years old and are licensed massage therapists.Another woman, who ran a spa in Vero Beach, has been charged with trafficking, and the investigation continues, as does a conversation about the role of men seeking sex for money in the trafficking economy.And Mr. Kraft’s name continues to propel the conversation about that investigation. “It makes my skin crawl to see him being smeared this way,” said Drew Bledsoe, the former Patriots quarterback.While Mr. Bledsoe and others who are sympathetic to Mr. Kraft say prosecutors are using the solicitation charges against him largely to publicize their broader investigation, it remains true that the sex trade often exploits women who have few or no means to escape it.As his lawyers fight the case, Mr. Kraft has been described by friends as conflicted. He is angry about what he did and ashamed of the embarrassment he has caused, yet insistent that he did nothing illegal and is defiant enough to hire a very expensive legal team to battle charges that most people settle quickly. Several people interviewed for this article say he continues, a month after the case became public, to break down in tears when discussing the situation.Casual friends of Mr. Kraft think the public reaction is overblown. “I can understand someone being 77 and going to a massage parlor,” said Larry King, 85. “He’s an older man who finds himself with a need and he gets that need satisfied. Why do we care?”Much of the fascination with this case stems from an as-yet unanswered question: Why was a gazillionaire going to a random strip mall massage parlor anyway?And the attendant tabloid headlines are a consequence of Mr. Kraft’s fame and wealth. Here is one of the richest men in the country — a pal of President Trump and the owner of a dominant football team — charged with a seedy offense.Now he must face the group he may care about as much as his family: his fellow N.F.L. team owners, who will gather starting Sunday at the Biltmore hotel in Phoenix for their annual meeting. Last year the talk there surrounded Colin Kaepernick and players kneeling during the national anthem. This year, the chatter will be about what penalty the league may impose upon Mr. Kraft for “conduct detrimental to the league” — code for making the owners look bad.Friends and colleagues in Mr. Kraft’s inner circle say that his current legal problems reveal his continuing struggle to recalibrate in the aftermath of the 2011 death of that “love of my life” — his wife, Myra. They married in 1963, when he was 22 and about to enroll in Harvard Business School and she was 21, going into her senior year at Brandeis University. They were married for 48 years when Mrs. Kraft died of ovarian cancer.“Bobby was so devastated when Myra died,” said Steven J. Comen, who has known Mr. Kraft since they were in kindergarten. “It took him a long time to get his bearings. If you can imagine becoming married when they were kids, and having kids when they essentially were still kids, and having the partnership to build something that was so spectacular — and her going through such a long period of suffering and then dying — well, it would have been devastating to anyone.”This wasn’t a situation where Mr. Kraft took care of the business and Mrs. Kraft saw to the home life, said Tom Brady, the Patriots’ quarterback for 19 years, who called from a family vacation to talk about his closeness with “RKK” and the Kraft family.“I remember bringing my oldest son, Jack, in to her office and her playing with him on the floor, with blocks and Legos,” Mr. Brady said. “She was very influential in my life and in many players’ lives. She was the mother of four sons, so she knew what it was like being around boys.”Mr. Kraft has had one serious girlfriend in the intervening years. He met Ricki Noel Lander, now 39, in 2012 at a party hosted by Steve Tisch, an owner of the New York Giants. They have gone through very public phases, like attending a New York City Ballet gala for which Ms. Lander served as a chair, along with Sarah Jessica Parker, in 2016, and she appeared on the field with him after Super Bowl wins, including after the most recent one. They also have maintained separate lives. In 2017, Ms. Lander became a mother to a baby girl. The Patriots released a statement that said, “While Robert Kraft is not the biological father, he is thrilled with Ricki’s blessing of having a healthy child.” (Attempts to reach Ms. Lander were unsuccessful.)Public and private reaction to Mr. Kraft’s most recent newsworthiness is complicated. Most of his fellow N.F.L. owners are reluctant to speak publicly about his crisis.But his fight against a relatively minor charge, using high-priced lawyers, is evidence of his sense of self-importance, possibly prolonging the media attention, according to at least one person familiar with that world. “The problem with Kraft is the problem with famous people, which is you bring famous attorneys and think they will do a better job,” said Hugh Culverhouse Jr., a former prosecutor and lawyer in Florida and son of the former owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “It’s like going to a knife fight with the entire Seventh Army.”Some politicians, including Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said they intend to give the campaign donations they received from Mr. Kraft to groups focused on ending human trafficking, according to The Boston Globe. A group of survivors of sexual exploitation are planning to send a letter to the N.F.L. to ask that Mr. Kraft be barred from owning a team.These days, Mr. Kraft is leaning heavily on one of his closest friends, Mr. Rubin, 30 years his junior. Like Mr. Kraft, Mr. Rubin is a billionaire who is branching into professional sports ownership.“We talk on the phone five times a day,” said Mr. Rubin in an interview at the Fanatics office in New York. (Actually, he and Mr. Kraft like to FaceTime each other.)They were set up on a friend date in 2012 by Mr. Kraft’s oldest son, Jonathan Kraft, the president of the Kraft Group and the New England Patriots. Mr. Rubin was divorced, and so they were two single men with 10-digit bank accounts. “I’ll go as his date to events, he’ll come as my date,” Mr. Rubin said. “My girlfriend is jealous. She’ll say, ‘I wish you talked to me the way you talk to Robert.’”In Charlotte, N.C., during last month’s N.B.A. All-Star weekend, Mr. Rubin chatted with an N.B.A. employee who revealed that he was a die-hard Patriots fan. “So I FaceTime Robert,” Mr. Rubin said, “he’s got his shirt off, he’s in bed. I say to the kid, ‘Say hi to Robert,’ and then I leave the phone.”Mr. Rubin is trying to keep Mr. Kraft hip to pop culture, but some references get lost. In February, Mr. Rubin was at a 76ers game with the actress Emily Ratajkowski and her husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard, a producer, and Josh Ostrovsky, the Instagram personality known as the Fat Jew. Mr. Rubin FaceTimed Mr. Kraft and introduced him to Mr. Ostrovsky. Mr. Kraft was perplexed. “What do you mean he’s a fat Jew?” he said. Mr. Kraft and Meek Mill first bonded through Mr. Rubin during a guys’ weekend in Miami to attend the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.“I am from the ghettos of America, and he is one of the most powerful billionaires,” said Meek Mill of Mr. Kraft. “He is more down-to-earth and relatable than I expected him to be.” After the Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl, in February, Meek Mill gave Mr. Kraft his $200,000 diamond-encrusted necklace that spells out “Championships,” the title of his recent album. Mr. Kraft wore it during the victory parade. “My chain is like my Super Bowl trophy for rising above poverty and overcoming the system,” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘I wear this chain every day. It’s my gift to you.’”Meek Mill said he had spoken to Mr. Kraft probably 30 times since the massage parlor scandal broke. In 2017, Meek Mill, now 31, was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating his parole. (Meek Mill pleaded not guilty to the initial incident, when he was 19, and said if he had done what he was accused of, he would be dead. “Everyone knows what happens to a black kid that points a gun at police officers,” he said.)Meek Mill’s friends, including Mr. Kraft, talked to him frequently while he was in prison and were outraged by his situation. Mr. Kraft visited him in prison a year ago and spoke to the press about injustice afterward.The N.F.L.’s inner circle is dominated by billionaires who lean to the right. Despite his friendship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kraft is considered one of the more liberal owners, backing an array of progressive causes and voting Democratic more often than not.“He is one of the biggest faces in America, and this is a smart guy saying to the world, ‘This is a good kid.’” Meek Mill said. “It was a big deal for me.”After Meek Mill was released, Mr. Rubin asked Mr. Kraft to join his efforts to create an organization called Reform Alliance, to fight for changes to criminal justice practices. The eight founders, including Jay-Z and Daniel Loeb, a billionaire investor, pledged a combined $50 million.Meek Mill sees echoes of his experiences in Mr. Kraft’s current predicament. “They aligned his name with a different set of charges that weren’t tied to him at all,” he said.There are big differences, and Meek Mill has made sure Mr. Kraft appreciates them too. “I said it to Robert the other day, ‘Someone as powerful as you, you have done so much good in the world and brung so much to America, you see what they did to you,’” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘Imagine someone that comes from poverty in the ghetto who doesn’t have people to speak up for them on their behalf. It happens in my community every day.’”Mr. Kraft grew up in Brookline, Mass., loving sports, though joining teams was difficult because he couldn’t play on the Sabbath. He liked the Boston Braves baseball team.He went to college at Columbia, on scholarship. As a senior, he went back to Boston for a football game and spotted Myra Hiatt in a delicatessen. He waited until her date went to the restroom and then introduced himself. He went to the library on the Brandeis campus the next day to look her up, and they married the following year.Myra finished college, and they had four sons; three work for the family business. After attending Harvard Business School, Mr. Kraft went to work for his father-in-law. Mr. Kraft had his own vision for the company, and left but eventually purchased the business and began to build a fortune in paper and packaging. As he did, he and Mrs. Kraft established themselves as a power couple in Boston’s charity scene. The family has given away “hundreds of millions of dollars,” a Patriots spokesman said.Foundations backed by Mr. Kraft are known to make unexpected calls to small organizations in which Mr. Kraft pledges a gift ranging from $100,000 to a few million dollars, urging the nonprofit group to create donor-match campaigns.A few years ago, Lisa Goldblatt Grace, a founder of My Life My Choice, received such a call, from an executive at the Patriots Foundation. The mission of My Life My Choice is to support young survivors of sexual exploitation and the commercial sex industry. The foundation gave the group $100,000, with a matching incentive. The money allowed the group to hire another mentor, Ms. Grace said.“We were heartbroken when we heard the news that Robert Kraft had been charged,” Ms. Grace said. “The most important thing we can do is focus on the victims and shine a light that helps people to understand that this is a multi-billion-dollar industry that preys on the most vulnerable.”In 1994, Mr. Kraft paid $172 million for the Patriots, at the time the largest sum paid for a professional sports franchise. Mr. Kraft and his son Jonathan flew back from the meeting to Boston (middle seats in coach on T.W.A.) to tell Mrs. Kraft the deal was done. She was worried that the high price tag would make it difficult for the family to continue its philanthropy. Mr. Kraft promised her that owning an N.F.L. team would give them an even larger platform to support their causes.The next night, Mrs. Kraft overheard her husband on the phone with the head coach, Bill Parcells. Mr. Parcells said he needed $10 million for a contract to sign a player.She was not happy. “The summer house better be in my name,” she told him.The investment turned out to be beyond sound. In 2000 Mr. Kraft lured Bill Belichick away from the Patriots’ division rival New York Jets. The next year, Mr. Brady became the team’s starting quarterback, and the Patriots raced all the way to their first Super Bowl win.The Belichick-Brady tandem has shattered records ever since. Forbes estimates that the Patriots are the second-most-valuable N.F.L. franchise, worth an estimated $3.8 billion.The team’s success has also burnished Mr. Kraft’s status inside the N.F.L., where owners can be hypercompetitive and jealous. By most accounts, Mr. Kraft has become the league’s most influential owner, with seats on the powerful broadcasting, labor and finance committees. His contacts in media circles make him indispensable during negotiations with the television networks that provide the bulk of the league’s income. One owner said that these multi-billion-dollar deals are typically negotiated by three people: the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell; Brian Rolapp, the league’s media chief; and Mr. Kraft.Now, amid what friends describe as Mr. Kraft’s unyielding anguish over his travails and the uncertainties he is confronting in the legal system, the N.F.L. and the court of public opinion, Mr. Kraft’s BFFs are rallying around him, and are eager to discuss the depth of their respect.Despite the solicitation charges, Mr. Trump has said he wants Mr. Kraft to attend a White House reception celebrating the Patriots’ recent Super Bowl victory.Mr. Brady is also standing by his longtime friend. “I’ve been with the organization 19 years and I’ve been through a lot,” Mr. Brady said. “He has been by me and supported me. That’s hard to do these days — to have longtime relationships like we do is a challenge.” Mr. Bledsoe, the former Patriots quarterback, said that even in the 18 years since he left the team, he still answers his mobile phone when the caller ID says “BLOCKED,” in case it’s Mr. Kraft, whom he calls “RKK.” “RKK has achieved success on a scale that few people ever achieved and kept his soul intact all the way through,” said Mr. Bledsoe, now a winemaker in Walla Walla, Wash. On a golf outing a few years ago, Mr. Bledsoe asked Mr. Kraft to tell him the one thing that matters most in building a successful organization. “‘There is no one thing,’” Mr. Bledsoe said he said. “‘There are no small details.’”Kenny Chesney, the country music star, said: “Robert has become in many ways a very strong mentor in my life. He believes that music and sports bring people together like nothing else.”Fifteen years ago, Mr. Chesney was dreaming of performing concerts in N.F.L. stadiums, which hold three to four times more fans than other large arenas. “Robert was the first N.F.L. owner to take a chance on a guy from East Tennessee,” Mr. Chesney said. He has played Gillette Stadium, home of the Patriots, in Foxborough, Mass., 19 times, more than any other musical artist. He has lunch with Mr. Kraft in his office each time he plays there.“He set me on a path and helped me see a blueprint for how to change the scale of my business and the scope of my touring life,” Mr. Chesney said.Mr. Kraft has made only a few public appearances since he was charged, including at parties hosted by fellow billionaires Ron Perelman and Barry Diller on Oscar weekend in Los Angeles.Mr. Rubin called Mr. Kraft and urged him to come to Philadelphia for Meek Mill’s first hometown solo concert since being released from prison last year. On March 15, Mr. Kraft hung out backstage while Meek Mill performed at the Met Philadelphia, a recently refurbished opera house. Mr. Kraft spent much of his time palling around with Meek Mill’s son and his son’s half brother.Inevitably, the chatter between Mr. Kraft and the kids turned to football. So Mr. Kraft pulled out his phone and performed his favorite party trick: He FaceTimed Tom Brady and handed the phone to the boys. "
"To Build a Champion, the Rams Took Risks. They Just Don’t See It That Way. - The New York Times
ATLANTA — Marcus Peters came into this week well aware of the narrative that had developed around himself and the other defensive starters the Los Angeles Rams had acquired since last season.“What you’re trying to say is, how does he take a bunch of guys who have bad reps and make them act cool together?” he replied when asked how Coach Sean McVay and his assistants handled the acquisitions of Aqib Talib, Ndamukong Suh, Dante Fowler and Peters.They all have run into trouble on or off the field. So Peters, on guard for any intent to trash the reputations of the Rams newcomers, considered the question before continuing. “I got a coach who just turned 33, he does an excellent job with us,” he said. “I think that us as a team, we’ve been doing a hell of a job by respecting each other, and it’s been all together with ‘we, not me.’”That spirit of camaraderie is evident up and down the roster heading into Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots on Sunday. The entire team talks about the value of liking one another, the comfort they have with the coaching staff. They frequently praise the work of General Manager Les Snead, who drastically reworked the defense in a series of moves last off-season — and one significant trade during the season — that helped turn the Rams from last season’s breakout team to this season’s N.F.C. champion.Snead faced equal doses of praise and criticism as he pieced together a defense that he hoped could better complement a world-beating offense. Talib and Fowler have been involved in off-field misconduct cases. Suh had long been saddled with a reputation as a dirty player. Peters, a 26-year-old big-play cornerback, had been dismissed from his team in college and made available by the Kansas City Chiefs for a trade because of personality conflicts and some heated arguments with coaches.At the time of the trade last February, Peters made a point of mentioning that all of his issues in the past had been related to intensity on the field and that his off-field record was unblemished.Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ executive vice president for football operations, said his team was not given enough credit for due diligence before trading for Peters and the others. “We did a ton of research on each of these guys individually,” Demoff said. “It wasn’t like we opened up NFL.com’s Top-10 N.F.L. Free Agents and said, ‘yes, yes, yes, no.’”Demoff said an important element of the decision was trusting the culture created by McVay and his defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips.“I think we thought that not only could our coaching staff and the organization handle it,” Demoff said, “but that it was probably a lot less of a risk than people made it out to be.”Phillips, who had coached Talib to a Super Bowl title with the Denver Broncos, said his approach when trying to bring together players of various personalities was fairly straightforward.“You ask them to do what you want them to do, you let them know clearly how you want it done, and if they’re not doing it, you tell them,” he said. “As long as you’re truthful with these guys, they can trust you.”Talib said that Phillips was a master of letting players be themselves, but added that it was not hard to come together, because Snead and the team’s other executives had done such a good job at finding players that would fit together.“Kudos to Les,” he said. “Les went out and got the perfect group of guys that could get in the locker room and mesh together.”In the regular season, the results were mixed for the Rams’ attempt at building a championship-caliber defense. The unit ranked 19th in yards allowed and 20th in average points allowed per game (Los Angeles had ranked 12th and 19th in those categories last season). Its biggest successes were the interior pressure created by Aaron Donald, who is expected to repeat as the N.F.L.’s Defensive Player of the Year, and 30 turnovers, which ranked third in the N.F.L.The problems consisted of a propensity to allow big plays, a softness in their run defense, and an injury that cost Talib, an 11-year veteran, eight games and left the team too short-handed to compete. Peters showed flashes of brilliance, but in eight games without Talib, the Rams allowed an average of 30.6 points a game. In the 10 games, including the playoffs, that Talib started, that number was 18.3.In the postseason, the whole group has seemingly been at its best. Suh and Fowler appear rejuvenated, generating a combined three sacks, and Talib and Peters took the best shots Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys and Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints had to offer and walked away victorious both times — even after you account for the missed pass-interference call on Nickell Robey-Coleman that has continued to be an issue for the league.Peters, who was called out by Saints Coach Sean Payton for ineffective play in the Rams’ loss to New Orleans in Week 9, approached Payton after the conference championship, presumably to remind him of those unkind words. Proving Peters’s point about how narratives can be twisted, some news media described the encounter as Peters trying to fight Payton, despite video showing that the cornerback was just talking.Now that he is with the Rams, Peters has found a team willing to look beyond a headline and find out what’s really going on. And if Los Angeles can come away with a win on Sunday, Peters, doubted by so many, will undoubtedly have plenty more to say."
"In Adam Gase, Jets Pick a Coach They Could Rarely Beat - The New York Times
The Jets have come to the realization that if they could not beat Adam Gase, they might as well hire him.After a busy, 10-day coaching search that saw the team chairman Christopher Johnson and General Manager Mike Maccagnan interview eight candidates, the Jets decided on Wednesday to name Gase their next head coach, according to a person familiar with the deal who is not authorized to comment publicly about it.The hire was first reported by ESPN and NFL Network, and a formal announcement is expected to come on Thursday.Gase went 23-25 in three seasons with the Miami Dolphins in the A.F.C. East, reaching the postseason in just one of those years. But he was 5-1 against the Jets, including two wins in 2018.It is a pivotal hire for the franchise, which fired Todd Bowles on Dec. 30 after four playoff-less seasons that extended a postseason drought that started in 2011. But in quarterback Sam Darnold, who will be entering his sophomore season, the team believes it has a franchise cornerstone brimming with potential.Gase, 40, checked a lot of boxes for Johnson and Maccagnan, who led the search. He is a young but experienced coach with a reputation as an innovative playcaller. Most important for his new team, he is a quarterback guru, who received rave reviews for his work with players including Peyton Manning, Jay Cutler, and Tim Tebow — work that the Jets hope will continue with Darnold.Gase was considered a rising star in 2016, when he was hired by Miami as the youngest coach in the N.F.L. He had spent two seasons as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos, who set N.F.L. scoring records and reached the Super Bowl with his creative, pass-heavy offense. As the Chicago Bears’ offensive coordinator in 2015, he helped Cutler reduce his interceptions and record a career-best passer rating.His breakthrough into head coaching, however, came with mixed results. Gase, who also called the plays for Miami, went 10-6 his first season and reached the playoffs — losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in a wild-card game — but the team failed to finish over .500 the next two years. Gase’s young quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, missed the entire 2017 season and five games in 2018. And with an injury-depleted roster this season, Gase received some credit for managing to keep the team in contention until the final month of the season.A protégé of Nick Saban, Gase did not play college football but started assisting on Saban’s staff as a student at Michigan State. When Saban later left for Louisiana State, Gase was the only staff member who left with him. And during the week leading up to the Super Bowl in 2014, Manning called Gase “the smartest guy I know.”Gase’s hiring caps a coaching search that carried a palpable sense of urgency. On Dec. 31, a day after the conclusion of the regular season, Johnson and Maccagnan outlined what they were looking for in the next coach, knowing that seven other teams were in the same boat. And the Jets quickly got to interviewing; the candidates included the former head coaches Jim Caldwell and Mike McCarthy; the coordinators Eric Bieniemy, Todd Monken, and Kris Richard; and the Baylor University coach Matt Rhule.Gase’s résumé stands out among those of past Jets coaches. He is the franchise’s first coach to be hired with any prior head coaching experience since Bill Parcells in 1997 and the first with an offensive background since Rich Kotite in 1995.While Johnson and Maccagnan did not rule out hiring another defense-minded coach, their remarks made clear that they were focused on finding someone who could mentor Darnold, the No. 3 overall pick in last year’s draft. And with the No. 3 pick yet again this year, and over $100 million in salary cap space this off-season, the burden is on Maccagnan, in the final year of his contract, to put together a roster that can finally compete for a division title.On Dec. 31, Johnson said he believed the Jets’ opening was an attractive one, and not only because of Darnold.“If you win here, you’re a freaking legend,” Johnson said. “That counts for something.”Gase will get the chance to find out."
"Sydney FC Match Moved From Sydney Cricket Ground After Pitch Furore - The New York Times
SYDNEY — Sydney FC's top of the table A-League clash against Perth Glory this month has been moved away from the Sydney Cricket Ground after a furore over the 'dangerous' pitch at the iconic stadium during the weekend.Australia's players' union joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in slamming the SCG pitch after visiting midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a knee injury during a match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said that although the Football Federation Australia (FFA) considered the surface to be ""playable and safe"", the April 18 fixture would be moved to Jubilee Oval ""in the best interests of all stakeholders"".""The SCG's (cricket) wicket block ... compromises the uniformity of the field for football in particular,"" he said in a joint statement with Sydney FC and the SCG. Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the 'deplorable state' of the pitch, which the body said posed a clear danger to player safety.The SCG is being used by soccer, rugby league and rugby union teams in addition to hosting its usual cricket and Australian Rules matches while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) is re-built. Some 3,000 square metres of turf were relaid after the surface was torn up during a rugby union match last month.Sydney FC travel to city rivals Western Sydney Wanderers next weekend but are assured of still being in second place behind Perth, who are six points clear at the top of the A-League, going into the match the following week. ""This is a hugely important fixture with first playing second and we want the narrative to be about the football,"" Sydney FC Chief Executive Danny Townsend said.""This is a decision made in the viewing interest of members and supporters.""The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988.

"Sheikh Salman to Stand Unopposed in AFC Presidential Election - The New York Times
HONG KONG — Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa will govern Asian soccer for another four years after his final challenger for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) presidency withdrew his candidacy on Thursday.Qatar's Saoud Al Mohannadi pulled out of the election for the regional body's top post and announced his support for Bahrain's Sheikh Salman, a week after Mohammad Khalfan Al Romaithi also withdrew. Sheikh Salman, who says he has the support of as many as 40 of the AFC's 47 member associations, will now stand unopposed in the election at the AFC congress in Kuala Lumpur next Saturday. ""I, personally, and the Qatar Football Association, will continue to support Sheikh Salman in the role of AFC president,"" Al Mohannadi said in a statement posted on the Qatar Football Association's website.""We are fully confident he will guide Asia as one unit in all forthcoming matters.""Al Mohannadi's withdrawal had been expected following Al Romaithi's announcement last Thursday.The new four-year term will extend Sheikh Salman's reign at the AFC to 2023, with the Bahraini royal first claiming the post in 2013 following Mohammed bin Hammam's ban from all football activities by FIFA.

"European Leagues Say Will Not Allow UEFA Competitions at Weekends - The New York Times
ZURICH — Europe's domestic leagues, concerned about plans to drastically overhaul football on the continent from 2024, say they will not allow UEFA club competitions to be played at weekends. The topic, alongside the revenue distribution model for the Champions League and Europa League, is set to dominate discussions when the European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday.UEFA has recently begun discussions with the continent's clubs over the format for European competitions from 2024.The European Club Association (ECA) has said it wants more teams playing more games in European competition although, after meeting in Amsterdam last week, added that it was too early to give details on what was being planned.However, the European Leagues are concerned that European soccer's governing body UEFA could ultimately give captive places to some bigger clubs and play matches at weekends.""We will always protect our weekends. We will not allow European club competition to be played at weekends,"" European Leagues Deputy General Secretary Alberto Colombo told Reuters.""The passion of football fans is driven by local football and by their tradition to go to the stadium with family and friends on Saturday and Sunday."" Colombo added that under the current model the clubs earned places in UEFA club competition by finishing at the top of their respective leagues.""If you give the big clubs guaranteed places in UEFA Club Competition and you destroy this model, it will devalue domestic football which drives the passion of fans,"" he said.European club football runs in three-year cycles with the current one ending in 2021.The format for the 2021-24 cycle was decided last year with the addition of a new third-tier competition in addition to the Champions League and the Europa League.However, revenue distribution for the 2021-24 cycle has not been settled and European Leagues are arguing for a greater share of the spoils to be given to the clubs who do not qualify for European competition.It wants so-called solidarity payments to be increased from the current 7.3 percent to 20 percent in the next cycle.In a recent statement, the Leagues said it was ""imperative to increase solidarity so as to safeguard the dream of all clubs, and not just a few rich ones, to perform in a fair competitive environment.""

"Defense Sustained the Patriots’ Reign Until the Old Guard Rose - The New York Times
After the first series in Sunday’s Super Bowl, which ended in an interception, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady angrily cocked his right arm and flung his helmet over a sideline bench.Behind him, Coach Bill Belichick was yelling in the direction of two assistants, who did not bother to turn around.On the field, Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower had a potential interception ricochet off his hands.Brady went back out for the Patriots’ next offensive series of the first quarter and swiftly moved them into scoring position, but Stephen Gostkowski missed a field goal, the first kick he had missed in five games. Watching near his team bench, Brady turned and hurled a wad of white tape to the ground.The Patriots were having one of the ugliest performances of any of their nine Super Bowls in the Belichick era, and that included the three games they lost. Yes, the Los Angeles Rams were falling apart, seemingly trying to give the game away. But the Patriots had not run away from the confused, tentative Rams. And they were still tied with them in the fourth quarter.But then, like so many other times before, when it counted most, Brady and the Patriots rediscovered the brilliance that produced five previous Super Bowl victories. An offense once out of sync found a groove that led to a sparkling touchdown drive.It was brief, but it had the cool efficacy of an assassin. The names so familiar. Edelman. Gronkowski. Sony Michel. And the Patriots’ defense, which was not even ranked in the top half of the N.F.L. this season, somehow kept the league’s second-ranked offense from scoring a touchdown.Seconds before the final whistle and a last, largely ceremonial play, the Patriots began hugging one another in the huddle. Seconds later, confetti showered the field and the Patriots were 13-3 winners.The struggles of the first three quarters were forgotten, a puzzling memory but of no consequence any longer.“It was tough,” Brady said on the field afterward. “We just couldn’t make the big play; we couldn’t stay on the field on third down. It was a weird game like that. We were doing so much right, but none of it mattered until the fourth quarter.”It was, in many ways, a microcosm of the Patriots’ season. They began the year 1-2, rallied and then fell apart again. But they made the playoffs, capping their run with their sixth Super Bowl win — tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most. They did so by outplaying three of the top teams in the league: the Los Angeles Chargers, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Rams, who could never figure out how to solve New England’s ’ ever-changing defense.The Patriots left their safeties deep for much of the game but kept switching the positions of their cornerbacks, keeping them in the Rams’ wide receivers’ faces on one series, and then backing off the next. And the pressure on Rams quarterback Jared Goff was relentless for much of the night.A sloppy, listless game like Sunday’s might make it hard to immediately declare the Patriots’ championship run this century as one of the best in N.F.L. history, but the resilience and the ability to come out on top year after year is hard to argue with.“It took all kinds of ways to get this done, even week by week,” Brady said. “We had to grind it out against the Chargers, at Kansas City and obviously again tonight when we really struggled to find a rhythm.“But I mean, world champs again. Man, it’s pretty unreal.”The tone of the game — chaotic, muddled, boring — was evident from the beginning. The Patriots were having their problems, but the Rams’ offense was hapless (they had just two first downs in the first half).The Patriots were marching but getting nowhere.There was one Patriot having a spectacular game: wide receiver Julian Edelman, who had 10 receptions for 141 yards and was named game’s most valuable player. In the first half alone, Edelman made six catches that resulted in a first down, including a 25-yarder that set up a 42-yard Gostkowski field goal and a 3-0 lead that lasted until intermission. The Rams tied the game with a field goal of their own in the third quarter.The pivotal drive of the game began when the Patriots took control of the ball with 8 minutes 50 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The first play of the possession was a nice touch pass from Brady, who lofted the football over the head of a defender as tight end Rob Gronkowski circled toward the sideline for 18 yards.Two more Brady completions had the crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium chanting, “Bray-dee!”Brady then settled in the pocket and, behind the near flawless pass protection he had throughout the game, lofted a perfect spiral that dropped over the head of two fleet Rams defenders who were nonetheless helplessly chasing the 6-foot-6, 270-pound Gronkowski.Gronkowski was hobbled for most of this season, sometimes comically so, and he is openly pondering retirement. But after two weeks to rest various leg and elbow infirmities, Gronkowski looked rejuvenated. His 26-yard catch moved the ball to the Rams’ 2.In the huddle before the play, Edelman looked at Gronkowski and said, “We need another one from you, bro, we need a huge play.”Gronkowski said, “He had been making all the plays; I had to step up.”On the next play, Michel bulled into the end zone for a 10-3 lead. A late Gostkowski field goal sealed the outcome.The Patriots, bungling, frustrated and unsure of themselves for most of the game, had found a way to another championship — as they have so often before.“I don’t know what was going on there for a while — it was strange,” Brady said. “I just know it doesn’t matter anymore.”"
"Ice Hockey: Canadian Women's League to Fold in May - The New York Times
(Reuters) - The Canadian Women’s Hockey League (CWHL) will discontinue operations in May, its board of directors announced on Sunday, saying it was no longer ""sustainable financially"".""Unfortunately, while the on-ice hockey is exceptional, the business model has proven to be economically unsustainable,"" the league said in a statement.The league, with six current teams in North America and China, was founded in 2007 to grow the sport of women's hockey. Last week 175,000 fans tuned in for the 12th edition of its championship, the Clarkson Cup, a new record for viewership, the CWHL said.New management and a new board had been put in place in 2018 and worked with contract staff, players, general managers, industry partners and corporate sponsors to establish an adequate revenue base, the league said.""Unfortunately the business model that has been the foundation of the league is not sustainable financially,"" it added.

"Barely Drawing a Whisper Where Hockey Is the Talk of the Town - The New York Times
Vacant red seats outnumbered spectators at a recent Toronto Furies home game. Just 310 people showed up that day at Mastercard Centre, the 1,000-seat practice facility of the N.H.L.’s Toronto Maple Leafs. The turnout was typical for the Furies, one of six clubs in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League.Sami Jo Small, the Furies’ first-year general manager, often sees larger crowds at her motivational speaking engagements. A three-time Olympian for Canada, she does more than 50 appearances a year across North America for corporate clients.That’s how Small, 42, makes her living. Running the Furies is largely a volunteer activity, for now.Through eight seasons as a Furies goaltender, Small saw the difficulties of drawing an audience. She took over the front office in hopes of building something bigger, an enterprise that could pay decent wages to its staff members.“I wanted people that are willing to put in the time and effort, because they see value in it,” Small said. “Eventually, my hope is that I can pay these people what they’re actually worth. At the moment, we can’t do that. We have to sort of acknowledge that reality right now.”Small and five other players founded the league in 2007, and she will concede that she expected it to be further along.Toronto is perhaps the world’s most hockey-crazed city, but not only do the Furies draw a tiny fraction of the Leafs’ audience (about 19,200 fans a game), their attendance also falls well short of the numbers for the city’s minor league men’s team, the Marlies. After winning the American Hockey League’s Calder Cup last season, the Marlies are averaging more than 5,600 fans. The Furies have had several strong seasons, winning the championship as recently as 2014, yet the attendance remains so low that the league often reports it as a zero.There have been significant advances recently in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League — which has a team in the United States (Worcester, Mass.) and one in China (Shenzhen). Last season, the players started being paid for the first time. Under a league salary cap of 100,000 Canadian dollars, players receive 2,000 to 10,000 Canadian dollars a season.Also, several prominent members of the rival National Women’s Hockey League, which has five teams in the United States, defected to the Canadian league this season.With the Furies, Small has noted another improvement, the kind many athletes would not welcome: tough analysis by the news media.Though drawing attention is a challenge in Canada’s biggest city, where the Leafs are covered obsessively, Small said bloggers had written about women’s hockey regularly — and with an edge.“When I played for the national team, I always felt like within the media, women’s hockey was treated with kid gloves,” she said. “It was, ‘Oh, it’s so great that you guys are doing this or accomplishing this.’ The only bad media written about women’s hockey was that women shouldn’t play hockey or women’s hockey shouldn’t be at this level.“There was never media coverage that said: ‘Sami Jo wasn’t at the top of her game. She didn’t play her best tonight.’ We now have people at our practices, knowing the players, knowing what level they should be at.”The Canadian Women’s Hockey League does not consistently report attendance figures. But the Montreal team, which draws the largest audiences of the four clubs in Canada, attracted 1,567 fans to its home opener on Oct. 13. Last season, when the league added the expansion franchise in China — Kunlun Red Star — to help develop women’s hockey in the country ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, the team averaged 2,000 fans. (When the North American teams travel to China, they stay for a series of games.)By professional sports standards, Furies tickets are inexpensive. A 14-game season ticket costs 175 Canadian dollars, and regular-season games are 15 Canadian dollars each. By contrast, the average price for a single upper-bowl ticket at Scotiabank Arena for a Leafs regular-season game is 94 Canadian dollars.The Leafs and the Furies started a partnership in 2012, in which the N.H.L. franchise invests 30,000 Canadian dollars annually in the Furies for equipment, uniforms and travel, and also to offset the costs of coaching. The club also invites the Furies to participate in various Leafs skills development clinics and youth programs, and the partnership expanded in 2015 to include the sale of Furies merchandise at the Leafs’ arena.Small said that the partnership had also provided superior facilities for the Furies and that she had used them to help recruit players. “We have a great, dedicated dressing room,” she said. “We have a gym right there and a medical facility.”Small, who played on a men’s hockey team at Stanford while working toward a degree in mechanical engineering, uses her home in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, as her primary office, where she also handles administrative duties for her speaking career.The Furies play weekend games and practice in Toronto from 9:15 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays — more frequently than any other C.W.H.L. team. It is the only time they can get the ice. Small tries to accommodate her players’ educational, professional and family responsibilities.Forward Anissa Gamble came to Toronto to pursue a doctorate in diabetes research, and defender Katie Gaskin is a chiropractic student. Defender Shannon Moulson — younger sister of Matt Moulson, a former Islanders forward — is an elementary schoolteacher.“Shannon Moulson lives in Hillsburgh, so she has a one- hour, 15-minute commute home after practice, and then has to be at school at 8 o’clock in the morning,” Small said. “Do I think she’s exhausted? Yes. She’s constantly on the road.”To help, Small made Wednesday practice optional. “When I think of Sami Jo, I think of how generous and approachable she is,” said Renata Fast, one of three Furies who played for Canada’s 2018 Olympic silver medalists. “She always makes time for that one-on-one connection.”To raise money and build fan loyalty, Small offers skills clinics for women in recreational hockey leagues, charging them 50 Canadian dollars apiece to skate with the Furies. A recent event netted the club 900 Canadian dollars.“I think we have a pretty big impact on them,” Sarah Nurse, another 2018 Olympian, said. “For them to come and tell us their stories about how they started playing hockey at 40, 45 years old and they just love the game, it’s amazing for us.”Small said these recreational players constituted the majority of Furies fans, attending with their family and friends. She focuses her marketing on them, rather than on young girls working toward playing professionally. According to the Ontario Women’s Hockey Association, the province had 38,914 registered female players at all levels of the sport in 2017-18.“The reality is that most of the young female players in southern Ontario have tournaments every weekend,” Small said. “Their parents are carting them off from one rink to the next rink. They don’t necessarily have time to come to our games.”Just two C.W.H.L. regular-season games have been televised across the country this season, and Furies games are not broadcast on radio.“It would obviously be nice if we had more of our games on TV and even more support from the Leafs and Marlies,” said Natalie Spooner, another of the Furies’ Olympians. “But I do think they try to support us the best they can. Hopefully, eventually we can get to the point where we’re more of a sister team and maybe play back-to-back games or something like that.”"
"Ice Hockey: Collapse of Canadian Women's League Creates Air of Uncertainty - The New York Times
TORONTO — The sudden demise of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) has left the future of women's professional hockey in North America in disarray with many of the world's best players without a club team to play for.The CWHL, which was founded in 2007, is one of two women's professional leagues in North America and consensus was they could not thrive as separate entities even as popularity of the women's game has been rising in recent years.""It was overkill,"" Ken Wong, a marketing professor at the Smith School of Business at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, told Reuters. ""This is a very limited, not just pool of talent but pool of fans. So to split them up two ways like that made no sense at all.""The CWHL has four teams based in Canada, one in the United States and another in China, where it was hoping to grow the women's game ahead of the 2022 Beijing Olympics.According to the league, a record 175,000 tuned in to watch its championship game last week in Toronto where a crowd of nearly 5,000 were on hand as Calgary beat Montreal for the Clarkson Cup.The CWHL, which boasts some of the game's biggest names in Canada's Marie-Philip Poulin and American Hilary Knight, operates as a centrally funded, nonprofit enterprise but said its business model has proven to be economically unsustainable.It will cease operations effective May 1.In the wake of Sunday's announcement, several Canadian players, including two-times Olympic gold medalist Poulin, posted the same statement on their social media accounts.SHOCK NEWS""The only thing stronger than the initial shock of the news, was the force felt by every single one of the players immediately coming together,"" the statement read.""We know what we have is not enough. We want to build a better future for ourselves and for generations of women to come. That begins now.""The decision leaves the five-team National Women's Hockey League, founded in 2015 and based exclusively in the United States, as the only professional hockey option for women in North America.The news also rekindled the oft-talked about discussion about a merger between the CWHL and NWHL, with the latter offering perhaps some reassuring words to players affected by the shutdown of the Canadian league.""We will pursue all opportunities to ensure the best players in Canada have a place to play,"" NWHL Founder and Commissioner Dani Rylan said. ""Those conversations have started already and have quickly become a priority.""Players, and even the commissioners, from both leagues have previously said a single women's professional league in North America would be best for the sport.Many pundits have suggested the ideal outcome for women's hockey in North America would be if the National Hockey League, home to the top men's players, provided its infrastructure, marketing and branding to unite the two leagues.But the NHL, which has previously said it was hesitant on assuming control over either league because it does not believe in their models, said it still has no plans to get involved.""As long as there is a women's professional league existing and providing professional opportunities to elite women hockey players, we have no intention of weighing into this space,"" NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told Reuters in an email.""That doesn't mean we won't be supportive, but there is no need to take a leading role. Professional opportunities still exist for the best women hockey players."" (Editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"A Mexican Hockey Player Looks for a Place to Lace Up His Skates - The New York Times
Perhaps the only thing more unusual than being a Mexican in Lithuania is being a Mexican hockey player in Lithuania.So the general astonishment that has greeted Hector Majul since his arrival in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, in late November does not surprise him.At 24, he is a forward for the Hockey Punks, one of four teams in the country’s largely unknown professional league. That move was another unforeseen step on an unconventional hockey path, which shifted when Majul was deported to Mexico during his college career in the United States.“He is an impressive skater,” said Boris Dorozhenko, Majul’s childhood coach and mentor. “The only problem for him was always his Mexican citizenship.”Like a growing number of international athletes who want to pursue careers in the United States, Majul found that his immigration status — and what some view as suddenly stringent enforcement of technicalities — had become a major impediment. In a country that has long tried to attract athletes and artists with special talents, what once appeared to be a fairly clear path to at least semi-permanent residency has become a far more arduous road. The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him. Because he was attending high school, Majul entered the United States with a student visa, then became a fixture at hockey clinics in the area, alongside a local standout named Auston Matthews. Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars. Majul was allowed to stay in the United States after high school, first on an amateur athlete visa, known as a P1, then on another student visa when he landed at Curry College in Massachusetts to play Division III hockey in 2015. By then he was a star for Mexico in international competition. In his first appearance in the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Division II Group B world championship tournament in 2014, he tied for the team’s scoring lead and helped Mexico finish one win shy of promotion to a higher division. He was named the tournament’s top forward in 2015 and again in 2016.“I know there have been professional players that have Mexican descent or Mexican parents,” Majul said, referring specifically to the N.H.L. (Matthews’s mother is from Mexico.) “But there has never been a Mexican-born pro hockey player. I want to be that guy.”But on Aug. 22, 2017, as Majul returned to the United States from a trip home to see family, Customs and Border Protection officials at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston discovered a makeup box belonging to his girlfriend, Katy Weizman. An American, Weizman had accompanied Majul on the trip and returned to the United States the previous week. The makeup kit contained a week’s supply of Concerta, her A.D.H.D. medication and a controlled substance.Majul said that the Houston Police Department had declined to further investigate his possession of the drug, but that he was detained and questioned that night and into the morning. According to an appeal filed by his lawyer, Majul told a customs agent that he had left Mexico “to pursue a career in ice hockey.” Based on this admission, Majul was found to have expressed an intention to violate the terms of his student visa. The visa was canceled, and he was deported after almost a decade of legally living and training in the United States. When contacted about this case, the Customs and Border Protection agency said in a statement that officers had found that Majul “provided differing answers when asked about his trip to the U.S. and the reason he departed his country of origin.” Majul’s lawyer submitted an appeal in September 2017, saying the officers had overreached in their decision. The appeal was denied. Marian Daugherty, who took Majul into her home when he first moved to the United States, set up a “Bring Hector Back” Facebook page and reached out to the office of then-Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, to no avail.Majul was left to train in Mexico City, unable to return to the United States until 2022 and without the services of an agent. But with only 1,552 registered hockey players in Mexico, compared with more than 562,000 in the United States, Majul knew he would need to go elsewhere to keep up his game.Majul and Dorozhenko canvassed their hockey network. Their search drew the attention of Arno Del Curto, who for 22 years had led the Davos hockey club in Switzerland. Equipped with a 90-day tourist visa, Majul ventured to Switzerland. Within three weeks, he was told that the team wanted him to stay.“It was a huge relief,” Majul said. “I’m going to be honest, I think I teared up a little bit when I talked to my parents.”But immigration would again become a hurdle. To qualify for  certification, Majul needed to have been considered a professional before arriving in Switzerland. Because he had most recently played competitive hockey in college and  with the Mexican national team, he was deemed an amateur and denied a visa. The club in Davos appealed to the Swiss government, even offering to hire Majul as a skills coach in the hopes that might provide a legal workaround.By November, with only five days remaining on his tourist visa and all his options exhausted, Majul went to train with a coach and former colleague of Dorozhenko’s in Serbia. Days later, he received an invitation to join Hockey Punks. The Lithuanian club signed Majul to a contract, provided an apartment in Vilnius and helped him stabilize his immigration status. In perhaps the most unexpected turn of this hockey escapade, Majul is not the only Mexican on the team. His countryman Arunas Bermejo joined the club while studying in Lithuania.“It’s a steppingstone, something to help me get to the next level,” Majul said. “Usually when people say they’re going to Europe, nobody thinks of Lithuania or Vilnius.”He acknowledged that the transition to life in Vilnius was difficult, especially considering the abrupt nature of his arrival. But he has come to enjoy his new surroundings.“It’s actually a really nice town,” Majul said. “Great food, people are very friendly. I think the only downside is how cold it is.”The average high temperature in Vilnius in February is 30 degrees — not frigid, unless your reference points are Mexico and Arizona.Majul has been approved for worker certification that for the next year or two  will allow him to work within the Schengen Area, a region of 26 European nations, including Switzerland. That would make it easier for Majul to rejoin Davos for the 2019-20 season. (That hope was muddled when Del Curto announced his resignation in November.) Daugherty helped Majul enroll in online classes through Arizona State University, and he is working to complete his degree.In his first professional game, on Dec. 22, a 5-2 loss to Kaunas, Majul registered an assist. In his first eight games with the club, Majul collected a goal and six assists. He has not given up on his pro hockey dreams, including a potential return to the United States.“I think in North America I have this label of, ‘Why is a Mexican playing hockey? He should be playing soccer,’” Majul said. “Don’t get me wrong. Here it’s also a shock when they hear there’s a Mexican hockey player. But after they see me playing, they see the level that I have, it kind of speaks for itself.”“I think that was maybe the way it had to go,” he added. “Maybe for me to be able to go on to the next level, I had to come and make it through here first.”"

"Building a Women’s Hockey Program One Loss at a Time - The New York Times
WORCESTER, Mass. — The Holy Cross women’s ice hockey team averaged nearly 20 victories over the last 10 seasons while hanging six conference championship banners at its home rink, the Hart Center.The senior tri-captains, Tori Messina, Julie Matthias and Sam Girard, helped the team win one of those banners, and the Crusaders posted a 62-17-3 record in their first three seasons.“We were so used to winning,” Messina, a defender, said.But this season, the team’s first in Division I, Holy Cross has had to get used to losing.It is 1-28-3 entering its final game on Friday night, at home against Providence. The other 34 Division I teams have each won at least two games.The Crusaders have been shut out in 11 games and have been held to one goal in 14 others. They failed to score on their first 43 power-play opportunities after scoring at a 30 percent clip last season.“No team I’ve had has ever faced more challenges,” said Peter Van Buskirk, who has coached the program for 19 of its 20 years, taking over in its second season. Before that, he coached the Holy Cross men’s team for 10 seasons between 1979 and 1997, reaching the postseason eight times.The former athletic director Nate Pine said it had always bothered him that women’s ice hockey was the only sport of the 27 at Holy Cross that was not playing in Division I. And when Holy Cross’s former league, the New England Hockey Conference, decided it wanted only Division III institutions as members, the college began looking for a new hockey home.Pine, who left Holy Cross in January to become the athletic director at Air Force, approached the Hockey East commissioner, Joe Bertagna, whose league had an uneven number of women’s teams, nine, including top programs like Northeastern, Boston College and Boston University.Holy Cross, with fewer than 3,000 students, committed to providing additional financial support for the program, and in May 2017 Hockey East announced that the Crusaders would join the league for the 2018-19 season.“As we continue to make investments over the next four, five years, we expect to be where we want to be,” Pine said in his final week at Holy Cross. “We’re not in this to be an also-ran.”The news that Holy Cross would join Hockey East came just two months after North Dakota announced that it was dropping its women’s program, along with two other sports, for budgetary reasons. Before Holy Cross, the last new women’s program in Division I was Merrimack College’s, which joined Hockey East for the 2015-16 season.Last September, L.I.U. Brooklyn said it would have a Division I team beginning in 2019-20, which would bring the number of those programs to 36 nationally. Northern Michigan is also exploring adding a women’s team. (There are 60 Division I men’s hockey teams.)It is not unusual for a college team to struggle after moving up a division. Bertagna said he thought it was harder for a program to move up a level than to start a team from scratch. Compounding the difficulty for Holy Cross, it began this season with only one class that had been recruited for Division I competition.Not only were returning Holy Cross players accustomed to winning, so were many of the incoming freshmen. Forward Carlie Magier won state championships for Belle Tire Hockey Club in Detroit, and goalie Jada Brenon won New York State titles while playing for the Nichols School in Buffalo.“This is a new challenge,” said Magier, who is tied for second on the team with 11 points. “I was looking forward to it. We expected to have bumps in the road.”One of those bumps came against Connecticut on Oct. 13, when some teammates expressed frustration with one another on the bench as an early lead devolved into a 7-2 loss. It was addressed immediately after the game, and now, Brenon said, “This team gets together better than any team I’ve been on.”Surprisingly, Holy Cross’s lone victory came Nov. 30 at home against Northeastern, which was ranked No. 5 at the time and is currently No. 3. Down by two goals in the first period, the Crusaders rallied for a 5-3 victory.Matthias called it “the most fun hockey game I’ve ever played in.” She added, “We finally got what we’d been working for.”Messina said she was crying on the bench as the game wound down. “I don’t think I breathed the last 10 minutes,” she said, laughing.Before practice on Jan. 15, Van Buskirk, 76, told his team he would retire after the season. He said that he had begun thinking about retirement last year as he was preparing for his second hip replacement but that he relished the challenge of competing in Hockey East.“Our record this year doesn’t indicate how successful this journey has been for me and for the team,” he said. “They’ve been very good about focusing on the process, not the outcomes.”Replacing him will be the associate head coach, Katie Lachapelle, who was hired in July 2017 after nine years as an assistant at Boston University. She has also coached national select teams for U.S.A. Hockey.“She’s brought a lot of Division I experience, and her exposure to U.S.A. Hockey and anything new coming up has been a big advantage for us,” Van Buskirk said.The junior forward Rachel Moore, the team’s leading scorer with 14 points, transferred to Holy Cross from Boston College.Early in the season, she said, the team’s play was “timid, a little cautious, without a lot of confidence.” Now, she added, “we know we can stay with these teams.”Maine Coach Richard Reichenbach said Holy Cross’s victory over Northeastern had gotten his attention. “You can’t do that on luck,” he said.But, Messina said, the frustration of this season remains. “I think we all thought we’d pick up another win or two this semester,” she added.In their first games back from semester break, the Crusaders lost a home-and-home series to Connecticut, 4-3 and 6-3, in which they led twice in the first game and were tied in the second period in the second.The next Saturday, at home against Maine, they scored twice in the third period for a 2-1 lead, only for Maine to tie the score with an extra attacker with less than a second left. Holy Cross had to settle for an overtime tie.What this season isn’t providing in victories, it is providing in perspective, as well as an appreciation for the course the team is charting for the future.“I look at hockey so much different now,” Girard, one of the senior captains, said. “I enjoy the competition every time we play. I wouldn’t trade this for the world.”"
"College Hockey’s Depth Is Reflected in Men’s Tournament Field - The New York Times
For many years, the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s hockey tournament was a celebration of the sport’s aristocracy.Increasingly, it is becoming a demonstration of the sport’s parity.Of the 16 teams in this year’s tournament, which begins Friday, only six have won a national championship.Arizona State, in only its third season playing a full Division I schedule, is the first independent to make the tournament in 27 years. Another first-time participant is American International College, a school of less than 2,000 undergraduates in Springfield, Mass.Bowling Green State is in the tournament for the first time since 1990; the University of Massachusetts for the first time since 2007.The fresh faces have come at the expense of college hockey’s traditional powers. For the first time since 1970, Boston College, Boston University, Michigan, Minnesota and North Dakota all missed the tournament. Combined, they have won 32 national titles.A variety of factors have contributed to the flattening of the pyramid atop college hockey.N.H.L. expansion and the growth of youth hockey in places like Illinois, St. Louis and the Sun Belt over the past couple of decades have deepened the player pool. Top-level recruits have more attractive destinations to choose from with the rise of programs like Penn State, Arizona State and Minnesota Duluth, which has won two titles since 2011 and is the top seed in this year’s Midwest Regional.Two of the top six overall seeds in this year’s tournament — No. 2 Minnesota State and No. 6 Quinnipiac — were Division II programs in the 1990s. Over the last seven seasons, though, they have the most wins in college hockey.Minnesota State has yet to win a N.C.A.A. tournament game in Division I, but Quinnipiac has reached two Frozen Fours and lost in the championship game to Yale in 2013.Quinnipiac Coach Rand Pecknold, who earlier this year won his 500th game at the school, attributed the success of programs like his to focusing on recruiting “the right type of player.”“We’re winning with a lot of kids nobody wanted,” he said. “They’re our bread and butter.”He added: “Success depends on more than just having talent. You need an identity and a culture.”A.I.C. Coach Eric Lang won only eight games in his first season, 2016-17. But last season the Yellow Jackets won a postseason series for the first time, and in 2018-19 they had the best regular-season record in Atlantic Hockey and won the conference tournament.“Every team has to find their competitive advantage,” said Lang, whose team faces top-seeded St. Cloud State on Friday. “For us, it was going over to Europe to recruit. We’re probably 60th among the 60 Division I teams in terms of resources, so we have to turn over every rock here.”A.I.C.’s roster features 11 players from seven European countries, including Norway, Slovenia and Ukraine.While the most prominent programs continue to get more than their share of top N.H.L. draft picks and players from USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program, many of these players leave college after one or two years.At rising programs, the rosters are stocked with players from the amateur United States Hockey League or the top Canadian junior leagues. These players not only typically stay in college for at least three years, but they also start their college careers at an older age. It’s not unusual for 17- and 18-year-olds to be playing against skaters six and seven years older.The teams with older players have more continuity from year to year, as well as more critical experience in postseason play. Four teams in the tournament — Minnesota State, Arizona State, A.I.C. and Ohio State — have an average age over 21.“There’s a ton of really good players out there, and there aren’t enough stalls with only 60 teams,” said Arizona State Coach Greg Powers, whose team plays Quinnipiac on Saturday. “And when you get older players, they’re ready-made for college hockey from the physicality standpoint.”Michigan Coach Mel Pearson led the Wolverines to the Frozen Four in 2018 but finished 13-16-7 this season.Referring to the changing dynamics in college hockey, particularly the balance between recruiting players the N.H.L. covets and building an experienced roster, Pearson admitted: “I don’t think we’ve adapted yet. We’re still trying to figure it out.”“In basketball, you can win with three players,” he added. “In hockey, you need nine or 10 pretty good players for a chance to compete.”Perhaps the team with the most daunting route to the tournament was Arizona State. With no conference affiliation, the team regularly traveled far for games, and most of its home games were played at a community ice rink with less than 1,000 seats.The Sun Devils won only 23 games the last three years. This season they finished 21-12-1, despite road trips to Penn State, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Boston University, Rochester Institute of Technology and Minnesota.Eight months after winning the national club hockey title in March 2014, Arizona State announced it would play as a Division I program for the 2015-16 season.“We just jumped into it and had to figure things out along the way,” said Powers, who coached the club program after playing goalie for it in college. “We learned that it’s O.K. if you don’t have the answers right away.”The players from his first recruiting class are seniors this season. Powers said he expected to be playing in a new on-campus facility sometime during the 2020-21 season, an indication of the university’s commitment to hockey.“It comes down to having the right people passionate about getting it done,” he said. “If you have the right people in place, you’re going to have success.”Boston College won the last of its five N.C.A.A. titles under Jerry York in 2012 and has reached the Frozen Four twice since, but the Eagles have missed the tournament three years in a row.“Everybody’s putting a lot of resources into their programs now,” York said. “I think it’s great for college hockey. We’ve got to keep growing our sport.”"
"A Women’s Hockey Star Emerges Again at Home in Minnesota - The New York Times
MINNEAPOLIS — The Minnesota Whitecaps, the newest and possibly best team in the National Women’s Hockey League, occasionally practice in an arena that is the closest thing to a women’s hockey museum in this hockey-loving state.Ridder Arena, home of the University of Minnesota women’s team, features sprawling murals high at each end, honoring the program’s Olympians and All-Americans. The Whitecaps stars Lee Stecklein and Hannah Brandt, gold medalists for the 2018 United States Olympic team, appear on both. And the All-American mural includes one of the Whitecaps co-coaches, Ronda Curtin Engelhardt.All were on the ice for a recent practice, with Engelhardt, 32, even joining her players for postgame sprints. But nothing in the arena acknowledges the Whitecaps’ leading scorer, Jonna Curtis, a left wing who was never a Golden Gopher, an Olympian or an All-American.That the unheralded Curtis, 25, leads in the Whitecaps in goals (eight), assists (11) and points (19), rather than one of the team’s three Olympic gold medalists — wing Kendall Coyne Schofield is the third — illustrates the deep statewide talent pool. Minnesota was the first state to sanction girls high school hockey, in 1994. According to USA Hockey, more girls and women play hockey in Minnesota than any other state: close to 14,000 in 2017-18, the most recent season available.“I’m happy to be here on a team with most of the girls I grew up playing with,” Curtis said.Last weekend, the Whitecaps, with 13 Minnesotans among 17 players in uniform, secured the N.W.H.L.’s regular-season championship with back-to-back victories at the Boston Pride and the Connecticut Whale. That also earned Minnesota (12-4-0, 24 points) the No. 1 seed and home ice throughout in the Isobel Cup playoffs.Against Boston, the speedy Curtis scored the winning goal with 1 minute 42 seconds to play, crashing the net from the left and putting in a rebound for a 2-1 victory. Curtis finished tied for second in the league in points, one behind Hayley Scamurra of the Buffalo Beauts. Leaguewide, she outscored all seven forwards in the league who skated for the American team at the Pyeongchang Olympics.“It just shows how consistent she’s been all year,” Brandt said. “She started the year pretty strong and she hasn’t really let up, whereas the rest of us have kind of gone up and down a little.”In a single-elimination semifinal on Sunday, the Whitecaps will face the Metropolitan Riveters. The league championship game is the next weekend.No matter what happens, the Whitecaps, a semiprofessional team founded in 2004, made their N.W.H.L. debut season an unqualified success. The league’s first expansion team and its first franchise outside the northeastern United States, the Whitecaps sold out all eight home games at Tria Rink, the practice facility for the N.H.L.’s Minnesota Wild, which has a capacity of 1,200. League officials say the Whitecaps are the first team in its four seasons to turn a profit. Sunday’s game is also a sellout.In the small circle of Twin Cities women’s hockey, Curtis is a familiar name. A two-time Minnesota Ms. Hockey finalist in high school — she, Stecklein and Brandt were up for the award in 2012, with Brandt winning — Curtis holds Elk River High career records with 280 points and 124 assists. All three attended summer youth hockey camps run by Winny Brodt Brown, the Whitecaps’ captain. Engelhardt was among the instructors.“We knew each other pretty well,” Stecklein said. “I remember hearing about this girl who was really good, had really good hands and had a toe pull that beat just about every team.”A toe pull is a stickhandling move, also known as a toe drag, where the puck carrier pulls the puck toward them with the toe of the blade to avoid a defender. In preteen hockey, only the most advanced players master it.Curtis planned on attending college in Minnesota until Brown, her idol and mentor, suggested she check out New Hampshire while in that area for a tournament.“I went and visited, fell in love with the people and the campus, and never looked back,” Curtis said.She broke her collarbone three times, which limited her to 15 games in her first two seasons. But she gained a year back through a medical redshirt and led New Hampshire in points her final three seasons without missing a game. Her 21 goals as a senior earned her first-team all-Hockey East.But the Wildcats never posted a winning record during her time, and USA Hockey never chose her for an age-group national team or international competition. Graduating in 2017 with a bioengineering degree, Curtis returned to Minnesota to work for a pharmaceutical company.She signed up to play for a team called Minnesota Shenanigans in the Women’s Hockey Association of Minnesota, a popular Twin Cities recreational league. Long hours and weekend shifts at work limited her appearances, she said.“I wanted to start a career and wasn’t thinking too much about hockey,” she said. “But that year I wasn’t playing, I missed it. Hearing the Minnesota Whitecaps were going to be a thing, I got excited. I had to try out.”Past connections helped. The Whitecaps founder Jack Brodt, Brown’s father, was a Whitecaps’ co-coach and the general manager. Engelhardt left her coaching job at The Breck School in suburban Minneapolis to join Brodt, a neighbor from Roseville, Minn., on the bench.No one had forgotten the fast-skating girl with the soft hands. “She was always in our loop,” Engelhardt said.Teamed with center Katie McGovern from Minnesota Duluth and right wing Kate Schipper from Minnesota on the team’s No. 2 line, Curtis had at least one point in each game of Minnesota’s season-opening five-game winning streak. Her best performance came Jan. 20 against Connecticut, with one goal and three assists in a 9-0 rout.Coyne Schofield, who participated in the N.H.L.’s faster skater competition during All-Star weekend in January, is unquestionably the fleetest Whitecap. But the 5-foot-4 Curtis is not far behind, Brandt said.Stecklein remembered an early-season race-to-the-puck drill between Curtis and Allie Thunstrom, a three-time Hockey East selection from Boston College and a former speedskater, being neck-and-neck.“We have the fastest team, and she’s right up there,” Stecklein said. “She’s shifty. She’s tricky. Doing one-on-ones, she can go in either direction very quickly. And her hands are so smooth that they don’t give anything away.”A job change allowed Curtis a more flexible schedule to fit in weekend games and most practices. Curtis shares an apartment with her Whitecaps teammates Margo Lund and Sadie Lundquist. Skating on a winning team with three Olympians and so many faces from her Minnesota hockey upbringing thrills Curtis, who thought her best hockey memories were behind her.“I’m happy to just be playing again,” she said. “I always dreamed of being in the Olympics, because that was the only thing you could do after college when I was young. Now little girls can dream of being a professional hockey player. It’s great to start that out.”"
"US, Canada Women Favorites for Hockey World Championships - The New York Times
The American women have beaten Canada in seven of the last eight world hockey championship finals, including a 3-2 overtime win two years ago in Michigan.Most expect another showdown between the top two national teams at this worlds, which opens Thursday in Espoo, Finland. Canada will play Switzerland and U.S. faces host Finland.Canada hasn't beaten the U.S. in a tournament final since the 2014 Four Nations Cup and hasn't won the world title since 2012. Still, taking two of three games against their Olympic champion frenemies to win February's ""Rivalry Series"" gives Canada some momentum.""Our goal in the February series wasn't to come away with wins. That was a bonus,"" veteran forward Brianne Jenner told The Canadian Press. ""Our goal was to establish the way we want to play and take steps forward toward the performance you want in the world championships. Obviously, it's reassuring when you're able to play that way and get some wins as well. We look at it as a good step in the right direction, but we know there's a bit of a ways to go to get gold in Finland.""The tournament features 10 teams for the first time, expanding an eight-team format that has been in place since 2010. Women's hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympics also will be a 10-team tournament.The world championship format was revamped after 2010. The top two seeds in Group A never faced the bottom two in Group B, which eliminated a pair of lopsided scores from the tournament. The world's top five seeds — defending champion United States, Canada, Finland, Russia, Switzerland — are in Group A in Espoo. Sweden, Japan, Germany, Czech Republic and France, ranking sixth to 10th, comprise Group B.What's different this year is the prospect of Canada and the U.S. playing quarterfinal games against a Group B opponent: There are no longer byes to the semifinals for the top two teams in Group A ahead of the April 14 final.Gina Kingsbury, Hockey Canada's director of women's national teams, said two more countries in the world championship can help grow the game — and she likes having the Canadian team playing together in a non-Olympic year.""To me, it's a win-win,"" Kingsbury said. ""It allows us to build some critical experience with our group. I do like the schedule more and how it's spread out. There is a bit of a routine there that can come into place.""Canada must play a game at least every second day in Espoo to reach the final.""When I look at the world championship schedule, to me that's exactly a best-of-seven series in the NHL,"" head coach Perry Pearn said. ""You have to get up on game days, you've got to be energized and ready to go. The day after, you've got to come down a little bit, get relaxed, stay relaxed, be able to rest and then you get back up for the next one.""Notes: Canadian captain and forward Marie-Philip Poulin didn't play for Les Canadiennes de Montreal in her team's Clarkson Cup semifinal series or the March 24 final because of a lower-body injury. Her status is unknown for the world tournament."
"Move Over, Gophers: Balance of Power Shifts in Minnesota Hockey - The New York Times
ST. CLOUD, Minn. — John Mariucci and Herb Brooks, considered the godfathers of modern college hockey in Minnesota, never could have envisioned this in their lifetimes. But when Coach Bob Motzko left St. Cloud State after last season to succeed the retiring Don Lucia at the University of Minnesota, he arguably made a lateral move, not a step up.Such a notion would have been hockey heresy in the 1950s and ’60s, when Mariucci coached the Golden Gophers to national prominence, or the 1970s, when Brooks led Minnesota to three N.C.A.A. titles before coaching the 1980 United States Olympic team to the Miracle on Ice.The Gophers used to be the premier program in the state, but that has changed.Last season St. Cloud State, Minnesota Duluth and Minnesota State qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament, with St. Cloud claiming the overall No. 1 seed and Minnesota Duluth winning its second national title this decade. Minnesota, a five-time national champion, missed the 16-team tournament for the second time in three seasons.And the balance of power continues to shift. St. Cloud State (27-4-3) remained atop both national polls this week, with Minnesota Duluth (21-11-2) fourth. Minnesota State (29-7-2) is second in one poll and third in the other. As the teams begin their conference tournaments this weekend, St. Cloud, Minnesota State and Minnesota Duluth are all in line for No. 1 seeds in the N.C.A.A. tournament.Motzko’s Gophers had their moments, sweeping two-game series against highly ranked programs in Ohio State and Arizona State in recent weeks. But their 18-15-4 overall mark leaves them unranked and tied for 20th in the PairWise, a formula used by the N.C.A.A. Selection Committee to fill the tournament field. Minnesota may need to win the Big Ten tournament for an automatic bid this weekend to avoid another N.C.A.A. miss.“We’re at the beginning stages of putting our footprint down,” Motzko said. “I know I’m taking over one of the most storied programs in the history of college hockey. There’s nothing holding us back except for ourselves.”The change in Minnesota reflects a nationwide trend of newer programs usurping traditional powers. Of the seven teams with five or more N.C.A.A. titles, only Denver and North Dakota are ranked. Conspicuously absent: The Gophers, Michigan, Boston College, Boston University and Wisconsin.What happened? More schools are benefiting from an expanded pool of players, coming from Europe and nontraditional American markets like California and Florida. And recruits have discovered more paths to the Frozen Four and the N.H.L.Over the last eight years, Minnesota Duluth, Union, Providence and Yale won their first national championships. Since 2009, the five Minnesota Division I programs (Bemidji State rounds them out) combined for seven Frozen Four appearances. Only Minnesota State failed to make it, even as a No. 1 seed in 2015.A decade ago, most recruits in the region considered the Gophers their best route to pro hockey. That is no longer the case. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that two members of Bemidji State’s 2009 Frozen Four team, Matt Read and Brad Hunt, play for the Minnesota Wild.“In the day, Minnesota used to take whoever they wanted,” said Brett Larson, the former Minnesota Duluth assistant coach who succeeded Motzko as coach of the St. Cloud Huskies. “Now these kids know there are four other great options out there, and they can find the one that fits them — not just as a hockey player, but as a person too.”St. Cloud, Minnesota Duluth, Bemidji State and Minnesota State share much in common. All play in relatively new or renovated facilities. St. Cloud renamed its arena for Brooks in 2013 after $13 million in upgrades brought it in line with similar arenas around the state.It was Brooks, between N.H.L. coaching jobs, who stepped in as the Huskies’ head coach for one season, 1986-87, guiding the transition from Division III to Division I. A young Motzko, a former St. Cloud player, took his first coaching job as one of Brooks’s assistants. Brooks helped the university secure arena funding before leaving to coach the Minnesota North Stars.“Herb Brooks’s vision of getting St. Cloud State to the Division I level was to create more opportunities for kids in the state to be able to play at that level,” said Larson, who grew up in Duluth. “That was the turning point. For Minnesota, and for the rest of us, it’s created a very competitive environment in the state.”Motzko returned to St. Cloud as head coach in 2005 after four seasons as an assistant at Minnesota, a stretch during which the Gophers won their last two N.C.A.A. titles. The Huskies made eight N.C.A.A. tournament appearances in Motzko’s 13 seasons.Reaching the Frozen Four in 2013, and joining the new National Collegiate Hockey Conference the following season, raised St. Cloud’s national profile. Their leading scorers, Patrick Newell and Robby Jackson, came from California.“When my dad first told me that St. Cloud State was interested, I didn’t even know who they were, to be completely honest,” Jackson said. “All I knew was the Gophers.”He neglected to wear a winter coat on his recruiting visit to campus, a sartorial snafu the assistant coach Mike Gibbons still razzes him about.Now in his 19th season at Minnesota Duluth, Scott Sandelin has sent 21 players to the N.H.L. His .739 winning percentage in N.C.A.A. tournament play (17-6) leads active coaches and ranks fourth on the career list.“When I first came in, Minnesota had always been strong,” Sandelin said in a telephone interview from Duluth. “It seemed like we were always behind them. That was good motivation to work hard and try to build your program to compete with them, try to get some of the kids they always seemed to get.”Sandelin prefers players from the United States Hockey League or Canada’s top junior leagues who might stay four years. So does Minnesota State Coach Mike Hastings. And like Motzko, Hastings expanded his recruiting beyond Minnesota. The Mavericks feature three players from Germany, and next season two are coming from Florida. (Another recruit has a familiar name: Sandelin’s son, Ryan, a forward.)In Motzko’s mind, the Gophers started slipping a decade ago when too many players began leaving early for the N.H.L. Minnesota traditionally signs more N.H.L. draftees than its in-state rivals. This year’s roster features 13, nine more than St. Cloud’s.Huskies captain Jimmy Schuldt, a senior defenseman, turned down N.H.L. free-agent offers last summer for one more crack at leading St. Cloud to its first N.C.A.A. title.Speed, depth and four-year loyalty were hallmarks of Motzko’s teams at St. Cloud. He said believes that formula can work at Minnesota.“I’ve got great confidence we’re going in a great direction,” he said. “I’d like to get there quick.”"
"Hefty Raises, Olympic Gold, and Then Crumbs for U.S. Women’s Hockey - The New York Times
In many ways, there has never been a better time to be a member of the United States women’s national hockey team.Two years after the players threatened to boycott the world championship tournament over pay equity, U.S.A. Hockey, the national governing body, is paying them more than ever, about $71,000 each annually.On the ice, the American women have continued to exceed the achievements of the men’s national team and won their second Olympic gold medal in a stirring final against Canada.Members of the team have skated in the skills competition at N.H.L. All-Star weekend and served as analysts for N.H.L. television broadcasts. Participation in the sport among girls and women is skyrocketing.But halfway through the labor contract with U.S.A. Hockey signed in March 2017, as the national team begins its pursuit of a fifth straight world championship in Finland this week, its players wonder whether the future of their sport is as bright as the present. Those concerns grew after the Canadian Women’s Hockey League, one of two professional leagues in North America, announced Sunday it would fold in May.Although the American players negotiated gains in salary and travel and medical benefits two years ago, the “groundbreaking support” for girls and women’s hockey promised by U.S.A. Hockey in the contract has been slow to develop. The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group created in the deal has been largely invisible. Minimal promotion for the team and a lack of organizational diversity in U.S.A. Hockey also raise concerns from players and female alumni that little has changed.“People are drooling for women’s hockey,” forward Kendall Coyne Schofield said in an interview late last year. “But the product we deliver isn’t being shown. There’s been a lot of lost opportunities, a lot of opportunities that haven’t been capitalized on.”Those opportunities included high-profile media appearances before the Olympics like a national magazine feature, a major network documentary series and other live television offers, which U.S.A. Hockey declined, according to three people with direct knowledge of those projects. After the Olympics, some players were unaware that they were eligible for four-figure bonuses offered by Hershey’s for winning the gold medal.U.S.A. Hockey’s executive director, Pat Kelleher, was not made available for an interview to discuss the women’s national team.After the Olympics, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, but players were frustrated that there were no plans for a post-Olympic exhibition tour. In an interview late last year, forward Hilary Knight lamented that the team disappeared when its popularity was at its highest.Because of the talent disparity between North American teams and the rest of the world, there are not many viable opponents for the Americans, and Canada’s cooperation is necessary. Last month, the two nations finally staged a three-game exhibition series, with one game in the United States. An announced crowd of 9,048 fans attended the game in Detroit, which was also broadcast live on NHL Network.But other avenues to increase exposure do not need Canadian co-signs, like merchandising. Nike, the official apparel supplier of U.S.A. Hockey and a company that champions equality in advertisements, does not sell jerseys of American women’s players or products specifically featuring female players. Neither does U.S.A. Hockey’s online store.Coyne Schofield, one of the players who has been featured by the N.H.L. since the Olympics, is inundated with inquiries from parents about where they can buy apparel with her name. She has memorized a response with detailed instructions on how to purchase customized men’s items, even down to the six-week shipping time frame. That’s how Knight obtained replicas of her jersey for her family.“That alone is so degrading,” Coyne Schofield said. “There’s no reason why anybody shouldn’t be able to go on usahockey.com and buy a Hilary Knight jersey, my jersey. Right now, women’s hockey is not accessible to consumers. It needs to be accessible in every fashion.”Nike, which recently unveiled soccer kits for the 2019 Women’s World Cup that for the first time were specifically designed for women’s teams, did not respond to requests to discuss its women’s hockey apparel.As with the jerseys, the American players handle much of their promotion themselves. Despite repeated requests from athletes, U.S.A. Hockey has not created social medial channels dedicated solely to the women’s team, as U.S. Soccer has. Olympians like Coyne Schofield and Monique Lamoureux-Morando worked as analysts on NHL Network and NBCSN. The players have lobbied the N.H.L. for more support for women’s hockey, particularly for its professionals, whose salaries range from $2,000 to $10,000.The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group was supposed to be a conduit of influence for the players. Over the past two years, U.S.A. Hockey declined repeated requests to discuss the group.The New York Times confirmed the participation of at least five women in the group, including hockey executives and members of the 2018 Olympic team. Multiple people with knowledge of meetings said the group was stagnant in its first year and only recently began having meaningful conversations. One player said she was unsure if she was allowed to talk about the group.In March, the N.H.L. and the N.H.L. Players’ Association announced the formation of their own Female Hockey Advisory Committee with the goal “to accelerate the growth” of hockey for girls and women in North America, and named 11 members, all women. They include Michele Amidon, a former director for women’s hockey at U.S.A. Hockey, and several former members of the U.S. national women’s team.But women’s representation remains lacking in U.S.A. Hockey’s leadership.Of all American Winter Olympic governing sports bodies, U.S.A. Hockey has the lowest percentage of women on its board of directors (17.58 percent) and is the worst at reaching its benchmark for female hires, according to the most recent data available from the United States Olympic Committee.There are full-fledged councils within U.S.A. Hockey devoted to youth, adult and junior hockey, but none specifically for girls and women. Decisions related to girls’ and women’s hockey are administered by the youth council, which is led by a man and where only four of the 25 members are women. There are also no women on the organization’s marketing council.Proponents for U.S. women’s hockey have long struggled to have their voices heard. Lynn Olson became the first woman hired to work for U.S.A. Hockey’s girls and women’s section back in 1988, but it served only as an advisory panel to the board of directors.During her tenure, which ended in 2013, Olson described U.S.A. Hockey as being run like a “good old boys club.” She was sometimes denied funds to hold meetings for her panel, so she put up her own money. Olson also said she tried to make the section a full-fledged council, which would provide more influence, writing up legislation that never passed.Olson noted that more women wanted to be involved in U.S.A. Hockey, but had a hard time getting elected to positions of power. “You need to change the minds of males in the room,” she said.Veteran leaders of the hockey team expressed faith that the culture could change under Kelleher, who was named U.S.A. Hockey’s executive director in April 2017. In recent months, he met with players in Maine, Chicago and Michigan.“We hadn’t had that in the past,” Coyne Schofield said. “For me, it was a huge first impression.”The United States national women’s soccer team, an inspiration for the hockey team in its fight for equality, was so frustrated with the lack of progress on a number of issues that the players recently filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against its governing body, U.S. Soccer.Knight said she did not yet foresee a repeat of the fraught 2017 negotiations that led to the boycott threat and a fracture between U.S.A. Hockey and the women’s team that is still being repaired.U.S.A. Hockey seems to be aware of the need for more gender balance. Don Gould, chairman of the girls and women’s section, said at the federation’s annual meeting that the organizational culture must evolve to advance opportunities for girls and women, socially and in sport.“This objective cannot be realized without first creating an environment that values them equally at every level,” Gould said. “Whether we work on the bench or in the boardroom, this is our first obligation.”But nine of 10 members of U.S.A. Hockey’s committee that nominates candidates to become officers of the organization are men.“There are great people at the top that care about women’s hockey, but you absolutely don’t have the numbers to have a real change,” said Angela Ruggiero, one of the most accomplished American hockey players and a former member of the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission. “We have an extremely long way to go.”"

"Truck Driver in Crash That Devastated a Hockey Team Is Sentenced to 8 Years - The New York Times
OTTAWA — A truck driver whose inattention led to the deaths of 16 people aboard a youth hockey team bus in Saskatchewan last year, a collision that shook Canada, was sentenced to eight years in prison on Friday.The defendant, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, had driven a tractor-trailer laden with peat moss at about 60 miles an hour past five signs warning him to stop before the truck collided with a bus carrying the team, the Humboldt Broncos. Thirteen other people were injured last April in the crash, which occurred with such force that the bus flipped on its side and the two vehicles slid well off the highway before coming to a stop in a pile of rubble.Many of the victims were young players who had come from across Western Canada to live with families in Humboldt, a farm town of about 6,000. They had joined the Broncos with hopes of either advancing to professional careers or getting college scholarships.Canadians mourned the loss of so many young lives, which prompted an outpouring of donations from across the country for the survivors and families of the dead. Informal memorials, like symbolic hockey sticks left in front of homes, quickly appeared.Mr. Sidhu had earlier pleaded guilty to 29 counts of dangerous driving.“Families have been torn apart because of the loss,” Judge Inez Cardinal said at the hearing in Melfort, Saskatchewan, after reviewing more than 100 statements from victims. “Somehow we must stop this carnage on our highways.”Mr. Sidhu, who worked for a tiny trucking company in Alberta, was on his first solo trip about two weeks after qualifying as a truck driver.There was no sign that he was impaired by drugs or alcohol on the night of crash, nor was he using his phone as he sped past the corner’s oversize stop sign and its flashing warning light. Nothing on the corner obstructed his view of the approaching bus, nor did he notice that an oncoming car had stopped for it.The judge said that Mr. Sidhu appeared to have been distracted by a flapping tarp on one of the trailers.“This was not a momentary loss of attention,” Judge Cardinal said. “He had ample time to stop his unit.”She added, “Seconds matter, attention to the road matters.”At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said that investigators had concluded that it was impossible for the driver of the team bus, who was among the victims, to have avoided slamming into Mr. Sidhu’s truck.The sentence was less than the 10 years that prosecutors had sought, but longer than most dangerous-driving sentences in Canada. Mr. Sidhu, who is 30 and lives in Calgary, Alberta, will probably be deported to India after his release from prison.“The sentence is subject to varying opinions, but what is important is that Mr. Sidhu pleaded guilty, has shown remorse and has remained accountable for his careless actions,” Jamie Brockman, the president of the Broncos, said in a statement.Since the collision, Saskatchewan and Alberta have introduced mandatory and more rigorous classroom and on-road training for heavy-truck drivers. They have also beefed up licensing tests."
"In Canada, a Hockey Revival - The New York Times
PETERBOROUGH, Ontario — The Rev. John Perdue is only 33, so he does not remember much from the heyday of the Flying Fathers, a troupe of hockey-playing Catholic priests who played comedy-filled charity games beginning in 1964.The Flying Fathers were the Harlem Globetrotters of hockey — touring North America and Europe, compiling more than 900 wins and only a handful of losses, and raising an estimated $4 million. They assessed penalties for skipping Mass on Sunday or “acting like a Protestant.” They brought out a horse, Penance, who was outfitted in goalie pads and trained to kneel reverently.Sister Mary Shooter would put on a display of skating and puck handling, then throw off her habit to reveal her true identity: the Rev. Les Costello, who won a Stanley Cup with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1948 at age 20 before retiring two years later to enter the priesthood.By the early 1980s, Hollywood even took notice and tried to make a movie about the Flying Fathers for which Wayne Gretzky auditioned.After the team’s 25th anniversary, in 1989, a number of Fathers retired and, although the team played until 2009, its aura dimmed.Now Father Perdue, the vocations director for the Peterborough diocese and a former two-time junior hockey champion, is trying to bring it back. “When I was a young boy, they were very big,” he said. “Everybody in the Catholic world knew about the Flying Fathers.”He has organized a new team of Flying Fathers and a tour, with three benefit games this week in Ontario and Quebec. If successful, this tour could be the start of something bigger.That is a tall order. Priests do not enjoy the same popularity they did when the original Flying Fathers played, in large part because of sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church. Spectators may not be receptive to priests doing comedy routines. The new Flying Fathers know they can’t escape the shadow. “The church needs a good news story,” Father Perdue said. “There are many reasons why this is a beautiful thing to do.”The Rev. Kris Schmidt, 32, from Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, said, “The church, now more than ever, needs to see priests as human, and I think it’s a great way that this bridge can be formed.”Some are not so sure the Flying Fathers can be relevant again.“I think the glory days are over, but they may as well try,” said the Rev. Pat Blake, 84, the longest-serving member of the original team, who played for more than 40 years.Father Perdue said encouraging more men to enter the priesthood was part of his motivation for reviving the Flying Fathers. When the number of seminarians declined in the original team’s waning years, it recruited police officers and firefighters to fill out the roster. Talent-wise, no one on the new team is like Father Costello, who played 21 N.H.L. games. He died in 2002, several days after hitting his head on the ice during a Flying Fathers game. The current players, who range in age from their 20s to their 50s, expect to be as skilled as a good high school team. Some grew up playing competitive junior hockey, and the Rev. John MacPherson, 55, reached the varsity level at Acadia University in Nova Scotia. Another, the Rev. Tavis Goski, 29, spent summers as a skating instructor. Many of the priests have stayed sharp by playing in weekly pickup games.The priests have been recruited from across the country; with everyone so spread out, they have not practiced together.Father MacPherson, from Kentville, Nova Scotia, who played with the Flying Fathers from 1988 to 2008, said that missing practice was never a problem.“They practiced once back in the 1970s and lost the next game,” he said. “So they said, ‘The heck with that, we’re not doing that again.’ They just trust in their coach: God.”In the days leading up to the tour, Father Perdue mapped out a script. Sister Mary Shooter, also known as the Flying Nun, makes a cameo in her flowing habit and scores on a penalty shot. She is played with gusto by a real-life nun: Sister Mary Catherine Perdue, who is Father Perdue’s sister. The tour has also introduced a Flying Monk, played by Father Perdue. The Flying Fathers are not straying from the original script — “an unusual mix of religion, hockey and comedy,” said the Rev. Tim Shea, 70, who played his first game in 1969.According to a new book, “Holy Hockey: The Story of Canada’s Flying Fathers,” by Frank Cosentino, church leaders did not support the idea of the team in the early 1960s, believing that such showmanship was unbecoming of a priest. Eventually, Bishop Alexander Carter of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, was won over.The original Flying Fathers were founded by the Rev. Brian McKee and played their first benefit game on Feb. 20, 1964, beating a team from North Bay, Ontario, radio and television stations, 13-4, in front of a crowd of 3,126.The Flying Fathers won the rematch in 1965, 16-6, and the official paid attendance was 5,030, the largest crowd for a hockey game in North Bay to that date, according to Cosentino’s book.The Flying Fathers began traveling across Canada, the United States and Europe, playing 25 to 30 games a season. By the early 1980s, “Real People” broadcast the story of priests playing hockey on American television.Cosentino wrote that several movie studios, including Francis Ford Coppola’s Zoetrope Studios, had showed interest in turning the story into a film. Gretzky auditioned, but his screen test did not go well, and ultimately a conflict over the priests’ portrayal doomed the project.The team’s second act has been years in the making. Father Perdue began organizing a game between seminarians and a group of hockey players in the Peterborough area, northeast of Toronto. By the winter of 2017, that game had become the Father Costello Classic, named after the Flying Fathers’ star.A member of the organizing committee for the classic suggested that priests should play in the game instead of seminarians.“Oh, boy, are we really going to do this?” Father Perdue remembered thinking at the time. “There was this giant legacy that we would be stepping into. I said, ‘Guys, if we’re going to have a team of hockey-playing priests, you can’t do this and not invoke the legacy of the Flying Fathers.’”Father Perdue called Frank Quinn, a retired police officer and former general manager of the original team.With the organizing committee meeting in progress, Quinn, 75, came bursting through the door wearing a Flying Fathers jersey, a Flying Fathers jacket and a Flying Fathers hat.Quinn got approval from former players and managers to use the name Flying Fathers, and the first test case was a benefit game in Ennismore, Ontario, in January 2018.The Flying Fathers won, beating a local high school team, 13-6, but six of those goals came on a “touchdown” after a football made its way into the net.The 650-seat arena in Ennismore was full. Among the crowd was the Rev. Vaughan Quinn, 85, a former Flying Fathers goalie but no relation to Frank, wearing an original team jacket. In his day, he would lie on top of the goal performing a juggling routine while play was in the other end.“He literally had tears in his eyes,” said Barrie Schultz, 48, who has taken over as general manager of the Flying Fathers, “because he couldn’t believe this was happening again.”"
"N.W.H.L. Moves to Unify Pro Women’s Hockey as Its Rival Fades Away - The New York Times
Since Sunday, when the Canadian Women’s Hockey League  announced it will cease operations, many have pondered how to elevate women’s professional hockey.Some answers came on Tuesday, as the N.H.L. became one of the largest financial backers of the National Women’s Hockey League — the only remaining pro option for women in the United States and Canada — according to both leagues. And the N.W.H.L. announced it would expand into Canada.Neither Dani Rylan, commissioner and founder of the N.W.H.L., nor a spokesperson for the N.H.L. would disclose the length and terms of the deal. The N.H.L. noted that it previously sponsored both women’s leagues, and has now increased its contribution to the N.W.H.L.A sturdy future partnership between the N.H.L. and N.W.H.L. could dramatically increase exposure for women’s hockey. But former C.W.H.L. players and members of the Canadian and U.S. national teams are waiting to see if the N.W.H.L. remains the best option this fall or if another opportunity materializes.To boost its appeal, the N.W.H.L., which launched in 2015, also announced Tuesday its intention to add teams next season in Montreal and Toronto. Those two cities formerly hosted C.W.H.L. franchises. The measure, which was approved by the N.W.H.L. board, would increase the N.W.H.L.’s reach to seven clubs across North America.Rylan said that it is “incredibly important” for the N.W.H.L. to include stars from the C.W.H.L. teams in Montreal and Toronto — like Olympians Marie-Philip Poulin and Hilary Knight.“We want to put the best product on the ice,” said Rylan, who met with N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman Monday. “We knew it was so important to have a presence there so those top players have a place to play this fall.”Knight, a star forward last season on Les Canadiennes de Montréal of the C.W.H.L. (and who left the N.W.H.L. after the 2016-17 season), declined to comment on Tuesday’s news, as she prepared to defend a world championship with the U.S. women’s national team in Finland this week.Rylan acknowledged logistics like travel to Canada must still be figured out. The N.W.H.L. also is looking at increasing its schedule to 24 games, up from 17 this past season.Until those issues and others are sorted out, Liz Knox, co-chair of the C.W.H.L. Players’ Association, said her constituents are willing to stay in a holding pattern, even if that means not playing come October.“It seems like a strategic move for the N.W.H.L.,” Knox said. “It seems a little kneejerk to me because our league just folded two days ago. We’re dealing with a very heavy loss. If you lose a family pet you’ve had for 12 years, you don’t go out and buy a new pet two days later.”Knox has been in contact with Anya Battaglino, director of the N.W.H.L. Players’ Association, to discuss the best steps for women’s hockey. Soon after the U.S. women’s team landed in Finland on Monday, it held a meeting with players from the Canadian national team. Since the two countries met in the 2018 Olympic final, both sides noted the need to work together to advance their sport.“There will have to be changes in the N.W.H.L. model to make our players happy,” Knox said, referring to athletes from both leagues. In Nov. 2016, the N.W.H.L. drastically slashed salaries.As of now, the N.H.L.’s involvement won’t resemble the N.B.A.’s backing of the W.N.B.A.: it does not include ice time, or major assistance in marketing, promotion or other business-related aid that would help the N.W.H.L.The N.W.H.L.’s major sponsor over its first four years of existence was Dunkin’ Donuts. That deal recently ended, but Rylan said the two sides are in the process of renewal and that she expects their partnership to continue.The N.H.L.’s cachet, of course, could open much bigger doors than the coffee and doughnut chain, including a larger network of international business partners, as well as possible new avenues for broadcasting and streaming options. More revenue from those outlets could also lead to an increase in N.W.H.L. salaries, which last season ranged from $3,000 to $10,000.Battaglino, who said she was extremely proud of the N.W.H.L.’s growth, prioritized better pay as an issue the league should address as it now prepares to extend its reach farther than any women’s pro hockey league before, with a co-sign from the largest hockey influencer in the world.“Women’s hockey players deserve a livable wage,” Battaglino said. “Women’s hockey players deserve the respect to be able to say, I am a professional athlete, proudly. Currently our athletes say, ‘I am a blank and on the nights and weekends I get to play professional hockey.’”"
"Wisconsin’s Annie Pankowski Tries to Leave College Hockey on Top - The New York Times
This weekend is Wisconsin forward Annie Pankowski’s last shot to go out a winner in college hockey.She is a three-time finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award, which will be given out Saturday to the best female player in college hockey. She has never won.On Friday, she will play in the Frozen Four with the Wisconsin Badgers for the fourth time. She has never won a national championship.Top-seeded Wisconsin (33-4-2) faces the two-time defending champion Clarkson (30-7-2) on Friday in the semifinals at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., with Minnesota (31-5-1) and Cornell (24-5-6) vying to play the winner. The title game is Sunday.“All the previous Frozen Fours have been different, but this one is my last,” Pankowski, 24, said. “As a team, we’re really hungry to win it.”A native of Laguna Hills, Calif., whose older sister, Ali, played hockey at Princeton, Pankowski started skating at 4 and played on her first United States national team in 2013, before four years at the North American Hockey Academy in Stowe, Vt. At Wisconsin, she was the team’s leading scorer her first two years, and again this year, with 25 goals and 47 points. She won four conference championships with the Badgers.Yet Pankowski’s hockey career has had devastating setbacks. She was a final cut for the 2014 Olympic team. She did not play for the Badgers in the 2017-18 season as she trained with the national team. But she was cut just weeks before the team was to leave for the Pyeongchang Olympics, after all the players had been assured when training camp began that the 23-person roster was set. The U.S. went on to win the gold medal.Pankowski called it “one of the most awkward, painful experiences of my life.” The day after she was cut, still “heartbroken, confused and angry,” she said, she began the drive back to Madison, where she knew she would find support among coaches, teammates and friends.“Those were the people I needed to surround myself with,” she said.She finished the season practicing with her Wisconsin teammates, and throwing herself into another passion: training dogs.Since her second semester at Wisconsin, she has been a volunteer at OccuPaws, a local nonprofit that trains guide dogs for people with sight and mobility disabilities. The program requires that the dogs live with her.“It’s something outside of hockey and school that’s not stressful,” said Pankowski, who often treats her teammates to dog visits at practice. “You can feel the excitement whenever I bring a dog into the locker room.”Pankowski, the youngest child of two veterinarians, has logged more than 2,000 hours of volunteer time with OccuPaws. That is one of the reasons she is a finalist for another honor: the Hockey Humanitarian Award, which recognizes a male or female player who makes significant contributions to the community through volunteering.Pankowski also works in the lab of Mark Markel, the dean of Wisconsin’s School of Veterinary Medicine, and she plans to start veterinary school there in August.“She’s a rock star as an athlete, a student, a volunteer and a worker in my lab,” Markel said. “I think all her hockey experience, including all the international tournaments she’s played in, has given her the discipline to pull off this off.”Veterinary school is a four-year program, but a yearlong commitment to play in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing is possible, with Markel’s blessing.“If she needs a year off,” he said, “we’re totally supportive of her.”For now, though, her focus is on Friday night and Clarkson, the team that beat Wisconsin in the 2017 title game. The Badgers were the top team in the country all of that season and outshot Clarkson, 41-20, but lost, 3-0.This year, Wisconsin heads into the Frozen Four 10-0-2 in its last 12 games. Pankowski scored Wisconsin’s first two goals in a 4-0 win over Syracuse in the N.C.A.A. quarterfinals last weekend.Watching the game online, Bill Driscoll, the director of hockey at the North American Hockey Academy, said he knew she would “take this game over.”“She has an elite-level shot,” he added.Pankowski was on the U.S. team that won the Four Nations Cup in November, and she will play for the Americans at the world championships in Finland next month. Despite her Olympic disappointments, she has won two gold medals at worlds, in 2015 and 2016.“She’s very cerebral on the ice,” said Bob Corkum, the national team coach. “She knows the spots to get to. She’s not the fastest skater or the strongest player or even the most skilled, but she’s very well rounded. All she does is put pucks in the net.”Whatever the results this weekend, Markel said, he had no worries about how Pankowski will handle them.“I think her resilience is going to be a blessing for her the rest of her life,” he said."
"Don’t Call St. Nicholas Hockey Club a ‘Beer League’ Team - The New York Times
An amateur men’s hockey club claims the ice at Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan at 4 p.m. each Saturday during the fall, winter and spring for a brisk 80-minute scrimmage, with the skaters divided into two teams, and no officials, face-offs or heavy checking.When these players first step onto the ice, they look like any other group of weekend warriors, but the giveaway is the crest on a few of their jerseys: a shamrock with St.N and 1896.This is the St. Nicholas Hockey Club, formed in 1896, one of the nation’s first amateur hockey clubs. The players are mostly New York businessmen in their 20s and 30s from Ivy League universities, and they play only a few games a year, but St. Nick’s lives on as an elite club.“There’s a constant influx of players who replace the people who grow up, if you will,” said Jim Morrissey, 42, a former defenseman at Yale known as Moose, who now lives on the Upper East Side, works in finance and joined St. Nick’s after he moved to New York in 1999.Morrissey sustained a knee injury during a St. Nick’s skate last year, putting him on the shelf.“It’s probably a sign that I’m too old to do this anymore,” he said.But he has vowed to return to the ice. He just loves hockey too much. And these are his friends, his “buds,” as St. Nick’s players call one another. He invited 15 of them to his wedding eight years ago.Like many other amateur sports teams, St. Nick’s is sort of a social club, and the players who participate in the weekly skates and games make sure to bring beer for the twin purposes of rehydrating and recapping the first-to-five-goals games they just played.“It’s not a beer league,” said Kevin Kaiser, 31, who joined St. Nick’s in 2011, after playing as a forward at Princeton. “Oh, we definitely drink after. But it’s high-level hockey, for sure.”Participation is by invitation, and only former college and pro players with strong hockey pedigrees are asked to join. (St. Nick’s recently invited a woman who had played college hockey to join, but she declined.) Annual dues are about $1,000, most of which covers the ice time at Chelsea Piers.Although professional hockey began to eclipse amateur hockey nearly a century ago, teams like St. Nick’s, especially in New York, formed a foundation for the sport’s growth outside Canada.According to “Metro Ice,” a 1999 book by Stan Fischler and Tom Sarro, the St. Nicholas Hockey Club joined the New York Athletic Club, the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn and the Skating Club of Brooklyn to form the American Amateur Hockey League in 1896.St. Nick’s had won three A.A.H.L. championships 10 years before the New York Americans entered the N.H.L. in 1925. (The Rangers joined the N.H.L. a year later.) Hobey Baker, whose name graces the annual award that goes to the N.C.A.A.’s top men’s hockey player, played for St. Nick’s from 1914 to 1916.Then Baker joined the United States Army Air Service and became a captain and a commander of an aero squadron in World War I. Baker, 26, was killed in a plane crash in 1918 about a month after the armistice. In 1945, he was the first American inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.The N.H.L. had only six teams from 1942 to 1967, so there were limited professional opportunities for hockey players, especially Americans. Curt Bennett and Herb Boxer were the first American-born players to be selected in the N.H.L. Entry Draft — in 1968.So amateur teams were popular among American-born players who had exhausted their collegiate eligibility. St. Nick’s, which has long outlasted its three original A.A.H.L. colleagues, drew players from the Ivy League and other Eastern colleges who landed jobs in New York.The St. Nick’s club played for many years at the St. Nicholas Arena, located at 66th Street and Columbus Avenue and built by the likes of Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor. The arena had one of the first refrigerated ice plants in the world. The club eventually moved to Princeton and to Westchester County, then to Chelsea Piers in 2006.Pete Bostwick, now 84, played for St. Nick’s from 1959 to 1984 after starring at Middlebury College. He was a stockbroker who lived and worked in Locust Valley on Long Island, but he would join St. Nick’s teammates for practices at Hobey Baker Rink at Princeton, nearly 80 miles away.“It was so much fun,” Bostwick said. “These guys were really into hockey.”St. Nick’s spans generations of players. The brothers Steve and John Cook joined in the mid-1960s after playing at Princeton. Their father, Peter, played for St. Nick’s beginning in the 1930s.“It was a club with a long tradition,” said Steve Cook, 74, a spinal surgeon who lives in Florida and Connecticut. “Everybody knew each other. It was pretty much an Ivy League event.”John Cook, 80, who played for St. Nick’s before and after he played professionally in Germany in the late 1960s, said, “It was a nice way to meet different guys in different businesses who also had an interest in hockey.”Steve’s 32-year-old son, Matt, joined St. Nick’s after playing at Union College through 2009, and for four minor league teams over two seasons. He still skates for St. Nick’s, but not as much as he used to, because he just became a father.“You kind of grew up on St. Nick’s stories,” said Matt Cook, a credit trader who lives on the Upper East Side. “I didn’t know they still existed. It was like a new lease of life.”St. Nick’s used to play several Eastern colleges regularly, but its schedule now consists of a handful of games against other elite-level clubs. This season St. Nick’s played a game against the Wissahickon Skating Club, of Philadelphia, and two against a team in Vail, Colo., in February.The club no longer has a physical headquarters like St. Nicholas Arena, which closed in 1962 and was replaced later by WABC-TV studios. But the team does have an email list with a pool of more than 50 potential players for its weekly scrimmages.St. Nick’s does not have the hockey reputation it had a century ago, or even more recently, when it won 10 national amateur titles in the senior elite, senior and open divisions from 1994 to 2005. But the players are determined to extend the club’s rich history.“Some of us like to limp to work for a couple of months,” Morrissey said."
"Citing Concussion-Related Symptoms, Rick Nash Retires From Hockey - The New York Times
Rick Nash, a No. 1 overall N.H.L. draft pick and a star for the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Rangers, has retired because of concussion-related symptoms, his agent said Friday.Nash, 34, trailed only Alex Ovechkin and Patrick Marleau in career goals among active players with 437. He also had 368 assists in 1,060 career games.“Due to unresolved issues/symptoms from the concussion sustained last March, Rick Nash will be forced to retire from the game of hockey,” his agent, Joe Resnick, said in a statement. “Under the advice of his medical team, the risk of further brain injury is far too great if Rick returns to play.”The Columbus Blue Jackets selected Nash, from Brampton, Ontario, in the 2002 draft. He entered the league at 18 and spent the first nine seasons with Columbus. He remains the franchise’s career leader in goals and points. In 2012, the Blue Jackets traded him to the Rangers, with whom he spent six seasons, and he also played 11 games with the Boston Bruins in 2018 after being traded there in February.It was with the Bruins that he sustained his most recent concussion, in March, though he did return for the playoffs. Another concussion, with the Rangers in 2013, caused him to miss six weeks.He was a free agent entering this season but told teams at the start of free agency that he was not yet ready to play.He led the N.H.L. in goals with 41 in 2003-4 and tallied a career-high 42 goals in 2014-15. He also won Olympic gold medals with Canada in 2010 and 2014."
"Driver of Truck That Killed Canadian Hockey Players Barreled Through Stop Sign at 60 M.P.H. - The New York Times
OTTAWA — The driver of a truck pulling two trailers laden with bales of peat moss roared past four warning signs and an oversized stop sign at highway speed just before it was struck by a bus carrying a Saskatchewan hockey team last April.The collision at an intersection killed 16 people, most of them young players on the Humboldt Broncos, injured 13 and spread sorrow throughout Canada.But the details of precisely what happened on April 6, 2018, only emerged on Tuesday after Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, the truck driver, pleaded guilty in a Saskatchewan court. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation obtained a copy of a statement of facts negotiated by prosecutors and Mr. Sidhu’s lawyers.The five page document, based on an exhaustive investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, concluded that Glen Doerksen, the driver of the bus, had tried to avoid an unavoidable collision. The bus skidded nearly 80 feet before striking the truck’s trailers. There were no skid marks from the truck.“The driver of the bus did not contribute to the collision,” the statement said. “The actions of Mr. Sidhu while operating the semi-tractor unit caused the collision.”Mr. Doerksen was among the dead from the crash, which left both vehicles well off the road and showered the intersection with peat moss and debris.Exactly why Mr. Sidhu did not heed the warning signs and failed to obey a four-foot wide stop sign with a flashing light is unclear. The investigation found that Mr. Sidhu had not been impaired by alcohol and had not been using a phone. The road was dry and clear, and weather did not impair his vision of the intersection.All the statement found was that Mr. Sidhu had “failed to recognize that his vehicle was approaching an intersection and did not heed the stop sign.” The report estimated the truck was traveling at about 60 miles an hour through the intersection.Mr. Sidhu, who lives in Calgary, Alberta, had only been driving heavy trucks for about two weeks. He had two weeks of prior training.Outside of the courthouse in Melfort, Saskatchewan, on Tuesday, Mark Brayford, a lawyer, said that when he recently took over Mr. Sidhu’s defense, the driver said that he had wanted to plead guilty.“I can’t make things any better but I certainly don’t want to make them worse by having a trial,” Mr. Brayford quoted his client as saying. “He wanted the families to know that he’s devastated by the grief that he’s caused them.”The Broncos had been on a two-hour trip north to a playoff game in the town of Nipawin. The players came from throughout Canada and stayed with Humboldt’s families.Long bus trips to games had been a regular part of life for the players, who ranged in age from 16 to 21. For many, the Broncos could have been a way to a college athletic scholarship or a pathway to a professional team.One player still remains hospitalized in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.Canadians have left hockey sticks outside their doorways in memory of the dead, who also included team officials. A fund-raising campaign for survivors and victims’ families raised more than $11 million.Mr. Sidhu pleaded guilty to 16 counts of dangerous driving causing death and 13 counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the death-related charge is 14 years and 10 years for the injury charges.A sentencing hearing was scheduled for Jan. 28.“If he spends a day, if he spends 10 years times, that’s irrelevant,” Scott Thomas, the father of Evan Thomas, 18, who was killed in the crash, told reporters outside of the courthouse. “He was guilty, he acknowledged that. That’s all I needed to hear.”"
"Jerry Westrom Threw Away a Napkin Last Month. It Was Used to Charge Him in a 1993 Murder. - The New York Times
A Minnesota man was eating a hot dog at a hockey game when, the authorities said, he wiped his mouth with a napkin and tossed the remains in the trash.It was the moment cold-case investigators had been waiting for.The authorities, who had used a genealogy company to identify the man as a suspect in an unsolved murder from 1993, dug the napkin out of the trash and used DNA on it to tie him to the case, court records show.The man, Jerry Westrom, 52, was arrested last week by the Minneapolis Police Department and charged with murder in the death of Jeanne Ann Childs, a 35-year-old woman who was stabbed to death in a Minneapolis apartment nearly 26 years ago.Mr. Westrom has denied involvement in the case, according to the authorities. A representative from a law firm representing him declined to comment on Sunday.Federal and local authorities used genealogy to identify a suspect and then worked surreptitiously to retrieve a DNA sample from Mr. Westrom, a businessman who lives in Isanti, Minn., and has a wife and three children, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune.The strategy was popularized last year after the authorities used an online genealogy database to make an arrest in the case of the Golden State Killer, who had burglarized, raped and murdered people across California over decades. Since then, genealogical sleuthing techniques have led to arrests in cases in Washington State, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.But the tactic has also raised ethical concerns about using genetic information from people who might have uploaded their DNA to find information about their heritage, without knowing it could help law enforcement officials track down family members.GEDmatch, an open-source ancestry site used in the Golden State Killer case, updated its privacy policy after that case to make explicitly clear that law enforcement may access a person’s profile to solve murder and sexual assault cases. And FamilyTreeDNA, one of the country’s largest at-home genetic testing companies, recently apologized to its users for failing to disclose that it was sharing DNA data with federal investigators.More than 15 million people have offered up their DNA to online genealogy services in recent years. While they represent a small fraction of all people, the pool of profiles is large enough to allow 60 percent of white Americans — the primary users of DNA sites in the United States — to be identified through the databases, according to researchers. Researchers believe that in the coming years, 90 percent of Americans of European descent will be identifiable, even if they have not submitted their own DNA.At a news conference last week, Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, did not specify which service investigators had used, but said that “it was a genealogy company you see advertised on TV.”He said he did not know whether it was Mr. Westrom himself or a relative who had uploaded the genetic information.In June 1993, Ms. Childs was found dead in a flooded Minneapolis apartment. She was lying on the floor, wearing only a pair of socks, with the shower still running, according to the statement of probable cause in the case.Ms. Childs, who had been working as a prostitute, was stabbed repeatedly, including after she had died, the authorities said. The authorities collected DNA from the crime scene, including from a comforter on the bed, a towel in the bathroom and a washcloth on the toilet seat, according to the statement.But for a quarter of a century, the case remained unsolved.A break came last year, when investigators entered DNA from the crime scene into genealogy websites and identified two possible suspects. One of the suspects, Mr. Westrom, had lived in the Twin Cities area in the early 1990s and had been convicted of soliciting prostitution in 2016, the probable cause statement said.In January, officers began following Mr. Westrom and eventually tracked him to the hockey game. They watched him order food from the concession area and then wipe his mouth with a napkin, before placing the napkin in a cardboard food container and throwing it away, the authorities said.DNA found on the napkin “was consistent with” samples taken from the 1993 crime scene, according to the probable cause statement.The police arrested Mr. Westrom at his office on Monday.Once he was in custody, the authorities collected another sample of DNA, which matched sperm found on the comforter and the towel in the bathroom, and could not be excluded as a match for the washcloth on the toilet seat, the probable cause statement said.“We all hope Jeanne’s family can finally find peace as a result of this tenacious effort by officers and agents,” Jill Sanborn, the special agent in charge of the Minneapolis division of the F.B.I., said in a statement.Mr. Westrom told the authorities that he did not know Ms. Childs and had not been at the apartment, and he denied having had sex with any women in Minneapolis in 1993, according to the probable cause statement.In a court appearance on Friday, Steven J. Meshbesher, a lawyer for Mr. Westrom, said that the arrest had been premature and said his client intended to plead not guilty, MPR News reported. Records show Mr. Westrom was released on bail Friday night.At the news conference last week, Mr. Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, recalled how he had talked with the district attorney in Ventura County, Calif., about the genealogy used in the Golden State Killer case.“I said, ‘You know, I bet we have some cases back home we can use this on,’” he said. “Well, we just found one.”"

"Wild Defeat Golden Knights 3-2, Stay in Playoff Hunt - The New York Times
LAS VEGAS — They don't call it the wild, wild West for nothing.The aptly named Minnesota Wild are still alive in the Western Conference playoff race after Devan Dubnyk stopped 35 shots in a 3-2 win over the Vegas Golden Knights on Friday night.Despite the loss, the Golden Knights clinched their second consecutive playoff berth when playoff-contending Arizona lost in a shootout at Colorado, which currently holds the second wild-card spot.Four teams sitting below the Western Conference playoff line - Arizona, Minnesota, Chicago and Edmonton - are within eight points of the second wild-card spot, currently held by Colorado.""It's desperate, we know where we're at,"" said Wild center Eric Staal, who had a goal and an assist in the win. ""We were crossing our fingers that Arizona beat Colorado tonight just to kind of tighten it up a little bit more. But we needed to win and we knew that going into tonight and we were desperate. I thought we were solid, competitive through our lineup. We deserved the win tonight, now you just have to follow it up Sunday for us.""The Wild, who are six points back of the second Avalanche, face Arizona on Sunday. The Coyotes are three points in front of Minnesota, which improved to 5-0-1 all-time against Vegas, including a perfect 3-0-0 at T-Mobile Arena.""Sometimes against certain teams you get good feelings and I think we're confident in what we can do against this team,"" Staal said. ""They got a good team. It's always been a tight battle every time we've played them. This is a great building. It's pretty easy to get up for the game. It was a good two points.""Minnesota coach Bruce Boudreau said while he's happy with another blue-collar win by his team, he acknowledged it was hard not to keep one eye on the score of the Colorado-Arizona game, as the Wild were hoping for a Coyotes win.""You came away with 18 players working together and a goalie playing really well, and that's how you win,"" he said. ""All we can worry about is ourselves. ... We've got to focus on our next game.""Minnesota came in mired in a 3-6-1 slide, but fueled by a playoff hunt, opened the game with a 3-0 lead on goals by Greg Pateryn, Staal and Kevin Fiala.Paul Stastny scored both of Vegas' goals, and Malcolm Subban made 30 saves. Subban dropped to 0-4-0 against the Wild.But it was Dubnyk who was the star of the night, improving to 4-0-1 against the Golden Knights with a 1.80 goals against average against the second-year franchise.The 6-foot-6 netminder made two of his biggest saves of the season during the game, both of which defined how dominating he has been against Vegas.In the second period, he laid out to stop Mark Stone on one side of the goal. Instead, Stone skated with the puck behind the net and attempted to score on a wraparound, but Dubnyk scrambled to make a highlight-reel glove save.""I shouldn't have gone fishing in the first place, that was where the problem started there,"" Dubnyk said. ""I reached and couldn't get there, so when he picked it up, I was kind of in trouble and you've just got to find your shortest route back there. I usually take pride in trying not to roll around like that, but sometimes you've got to have some desperation and those are fun when you get a chance to make them.""In the game's waning moments, Dubnyk extended his leg to stonewall Stastny with his pad to preserve the win for the Wild.The Golden Knights, who are five points behind San Jose in the Pacific Division, travel to play the Sharks on Saturday.""I'm real happy.

"Ryan Scores Twice, Flames Chase Quick in 7-2 Rout of Kings - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — The Calgary Flames made wholesale changes to their lineup, sitting two top forwards and four defensemen one night after winning the Pacific Division and securing home-ice advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs.They still steamrolled the hapless Los Angeles Kings.Derek Ryan scored twice, Mark Jankowski had a goal and two assists and the Flames routed the Kings 7-2 on Monday.""You don't just turn it on in playoff time,"" Jankowski said. ""This is the time of year where you really ramp it up for playoffs, so for us we want to be playing our best hockey going into the playoffs.""Sam Bennett, Johnny Gaudreau, James Neal and Andrew Mangiapane also scored for the Flames, who reached 50 wins for the second time in franchise history. David Rittich made 23 saves.The only other time the Flames won 50 games was in 1988-89, when they had 54 victories in the regular season before hoisting their only Stanley Cup. Ryan said this group is trying to appreciate its current success but understands what comes next is more important.""I think that we're trying to take a step back and realize that we've really accomplished something special here, but you're just so consumed in the middle of the season,"" Ryan said. ""All these games going on, it's hard to really do that. I think maybe at the end of the year we can do that, but right now the goal is ahead of us and we're looking forward to that.""Kings goalie Jonathan Quick was removed in the third period after allowing seven goals on 25 shots. Kyle Clifford and Dustin Brown scored, and Anze Kopitar had an assist in his 1,000th game.It took some time for the reconfigured Flames to find their footing. Gaudreau put them up 3-2 at 6:46 of the second period with a sharp-angle shot into the far corner, but the real barrage started 13 seconds into the third when Neal scored for a 4-2 lead.Ryan got his second goal at 2:33, and Mangiapane made it 6-2 at 8:30.Jack Campbell replaced Quick after Jankowski put the Flames ahead 7-2 at 8:45.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Tanner Pearson is experienced when it comes to replay reviews.""It's how I scored my first NHL goal, under review. I've been there multiple times before,"" Pearson said Tuesday after yet another reviewed goal helped the Vancouver Canucks to a 4-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks.Martin Jones had just stopped a shot by Vancouver's Loui Eriksson midway through the third period when Pearson stepped in to fight for the rebound, knocking the puck free and poking it into the back of the net for his second of the night.Officials on the ice initially ruled no goal, but the call was quickly overturned.San Jose coach Peter DeBoer then challenged, citing goalie interference. A review in Toronto determined the goal was good, saying the puck was loose.""I just tried to throw a stick there, whether it was covered or not. It was a good goal at the end of the day,"" Pearson said.The play tied it at 2. Markus Granlund put Vancouver ahead to stay with his 11th of the season at 13:39, and defenseman Troy Stecher added an empty-netter with 90 seconds left.""To be down a goal going into the third period and come back and take the victory was a big positive note,"" Pearson said.""Especially playing these playoff teams, teams that are saddling up to go to the playoffs, they're playing their best hockey or want to anyway. And if we can withstand that and beat some teams, it could carry some momentum into next year.""The 26-year-old Pearson has nine points since he was acquired in a trade with the Pittsburgh Penguins at the deadline. He has scored five times in his last seven games.""He's a treat to have on my wing right now,"" center Bo Horvat said. ""He's fast, aggressive, he gets on the forecheck, he's smart, he can make plays. He's a great hockey player.""Kevin Labanc and Joe Pavelski scored for San Jose (45-26-9). Jones had 19 saves.The loss added to a tough stretch for the Sharks, who are 1-8-1 in their past 10 games and haven't had a regulation win since March 12.""I thought we were in control of the game,"" DeBoer said. ""Our failure was not extending the lead. We had four or five really good chances to extend the lead to 3-1 at different points and didn't do that, let them hang around and that's what happens.""The Sharks need to figure out how to play a full 60-minute game before the playoffs begin, said veteran center Joe Thornton.""We got two kinds of practice shots at this again and then the real season starts, so hopefully we can put it together in Edmonton and then put it together against Colorado and then get ready for Vegas,"" he said.

EDMONTON, Alberta — It had been 34 years since Edmonton Oilers teammates enjoyed a game like this.Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Leon Draisaitl each scored three goals as Edmonton powered its way to an 8-4 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday night.The last time two Oilers posted hat tricks in the same game was 1985, when Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri also did it against the Kings.""I'm happy for both of them,"" said Edmonton captain Connor McDavid, who had a goal and three assists.

"For Stephane Matteau, a Famous Goal Could Not Cover the Darkness - The New York Times
The tattoo etched across the left side of Stephane Matteau’s torso reminds him of a signature life goal.It does not depict his immortal moment 25 years ago this May. There is no image of the Stanley Cup, which he raised two weeks later at Madison Square Garden to celebrate the Rangers’ first championship in 54 years.As the Rangers’ eternal playoff hero lifts his shirt, he reveals the inked-in words he aspires to: “Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.”Matteau is wiser and sober at 49. He has battled struggles familiar to the hockey culture he grew up in: mental scars, fear, alcoholism. All of which almost cost him his life.He had lived every Canadian child’s dream, reaching the N.H.L., playing 13 seasons and being a playoff hero. On May 27, 1994, in the second overtime of Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Devils, Matteau scored perhaps the most significant goal in Rangers history. His name — and Howie Rose’s “Matteau, Matteau, Matteau!” radio call — have a permanent place in New York sports history.Whenever Matteau returns to the city — as he will Friday, when the Rangers host a reunion of the 1994 Stanley Cup champions — he knows he is part of a venerated alumni group. He still receives effusive gratitude from Rangers fans. Yet his famous goal, which he still calls lucky, does not erase lingering feelings of doubt and career dissatisfaction.Depression marred his childhood, his hockey career and his retirement. He gave up drinking 17 years ago, but his anxieties and mental struggles were becoming too much to bear. About seven years ago, Matteau realized he was heading toward “a dark and dangerous place” and finally sought counseling.“I’m humbled, very privileged, I was the chosen one,” he said of his playoff heroics. “I feel blessed to have a lot of good people around me, during good times, and especially the bad ones.”Matteau was an inconsistent 24-year-old left wing when the Cup-starved Rangers acquired him and Brian Noonan from Chicago at the March 1994 trade deadline, because of the persistence of Coach Mike Keenan.“Mike was banging on me all season about getting Matteau,” recalled Neil Smith, the general manager at the time, who gave up Tony Amonte, a 33-goal scorer the previous season. “He went to the finals with him in Chicago in ’92. Although we had the best record in the league, Mike felt adamant we’d need size and depth in the playoffs, even if we had to give up our future.”Matteau was a revelation in the playoffs. He scored six goals, including a double-overtime goal in Game 3 against the Devils, and repeated the feat in Game 7, making him an instant celebrity.Yet his tenure in New York lasted only a year and a half. He was so unproductive for the Rangers after they won the Cup that Smith traded Matteau to St. Louis. There he was reunited with Keenan, who acquired Matteau four times during his N.H.L. coaching stints.Keenan said he appreciated the team skills that Matteau brought. “He was a versatile player, a big, strong skater who was the type of player you need in the playoffs,” Keenan said. “We needed him in New York to win the Cup, particularly against New Jersey, with how big they were.“I pushed him hard, like everyone. I saw he had some self-doubt, but I never once had any doubt about him.”Matteau could not sustain the confidence his former coach had in him.“I was known as a playoff player,” said Matteau, who never scored more than 19 goals a season during his career. “And then I go the next seven years without one goal in the playoffs. Why is that?”He played in Calgary, Chicago, New York, St. Louis, San Jose and Florida. Much of the baggage Matteau carried to those places was psychological.His doubt stretched back to a tormented childhood in northwestern Quebec. He grew up in Rouyn (now Rouyn-Noranda), a small middle-class town about 380 miles from Montreal. It has produced 27 N.H.L. players, including stars like Pierre Turgeon and his brother Sylvain, Dave Keon, Réjean Houle and Eric Desjardins.One of Matteau’s closest friends was Pierre Turgeon. They were born five days apart and were teammates on youth baseball and hockey teams. Turgeon, who went on to score more than 500 goals in a 19-year N.H.L. career, said Matteau was always “selling himself a little short,” despite his prowess as a multisport athlete.“Even as a pro, Steph used to worry,” Turgeon said. “I remember when he got traded to St. Louis, he was put on a line with me and Brett Hull, which was great. But he says to me, ‘What if I get 20 goals? Everyone will always expect me to do it again.’”A gangly boy with a bad complexion, Matteau said, he was a frequent target of bullies.Worse, though, was his father’s relentless criticism. “Whatever I did, it wasn’t good enough,” Matteau said.Turgeon noticed that Matteau’s father, a mechanic in a car dealership, was “very hard on him.”“But,” he added, “I don’t think anybody knew what was going on with Steph inside.”As 12-year-olds, Turgeon and Matteau were the standouts on the Canadian baseball team that went to the 1982 Little League World Series. But Matteau’s self-esteem worsened. Around the time he was 15, Matteau seriously considered suicide. That he did not go through with it made him feel even more cowardly.“If I could’ve spent my entire youth curled up under a rug,” Matteau said, “I would have.”He has found new purpose in his sobriety: talking to young people about overcoming despair, relating to their fears and vulnerabilities as authentically as he can.Almost two years ago, Matteau helped create a leadership program for Bronx elementary and middle school students in partnership with Woodlawn Cemetery. He has visited about 50 schools.“I struggled with a lot of things the kids go through, being bullied, feeling hopeless,” Matteau said. “I want them to know they can change their own lives.”Matteau, who lives in Montreal, has also been mentoring at-risk teens at River Rock Academy, an alternative school, in Lancaster, Pa. His wife of 24 years, Nathalie, frequently participates in the Lancaster programs, a reaffirmation of her belief in her husband, who seldom believed in himself.“What that woman has endured with me,” he said, “it’s a miracle she refused to lose hope.”Both his children play hockey. His son, Stefan, 25, is a former first-round draft pick of the Devils who now plays for the Vegas Golden Knights’ top affiliate, and his daughter, Alyson, 21, is a senior on the University of Maine women’s hockey team.Several years ago, Matteau coached a Quebec junior team that his son played on, and things frequently grew tense.“I was hard on Stef,” Matteau said. “I didn’t want him to make the same mistakes as me.”His wife interceded, reminding Matteau of the pressure his own father put on him.On a blustery January day, Matteau visited P.S. 69 in the South Bronx for a session with 20 fifth graders. He is a big man at 6 feet 4 inches and a only few pounds over his playing weight, 220. With casual humor, he easily connected with a multicultural group of children in his French Canadian accent.Matteau talked to the students about their positive traits, about their relationships with peers and family. The conversations are designed to empower them to be kinder and more empathetic toward one another.His two-hour program opened with a video of him scoring his famous Game 7 goal against the Devils.“I’ve watched this video 10,000 times, and I still get goose bumps,” Matteau told the students. “That was a great, exciting moment for me.

John Tavares scored against his former team in the third period as the visiting Toronto Maple Leafs clinched a playoff berth with a 2-1 victory over the New York Islanders on Monday in Uniondale, N.Y.Defenseman Calle Rosen scored his first career NHL goal and Frederik Andersen made 28 saves for the Maple Leafs, who averted a season sweep by New York and moved within four points of second-place Boston in the Atlantic Division.Jordan Eberle scored to extend his goal-scoring streak to three games for the Islanders, who fell for the second time in six contests to remain just two points ahead of third-place Pittsburgh in the Metropolitan Division.New York's Robin Lehner, who made 36 saves on Monday, turned aside 105 of 108 shots in the season series.Tavares was booed throughout the game in his second visit to Long Island after signing a seven-year, $77 million contract in the offseason. He added to the negative response by depositing Mitch Marner's drop pass into the top left corner of the net for his team-leading 46th goal to give Toronto a 2-0 lead at 3:50 of the third period.The Islanders scored on the power play to trim the deficit with 5:05 remaining in the third. Defenseman Devon Toews, who hit the post earlier in the period, sent the puck toward the net and Brock Nelson settled it before backhanding a feed for an easy conversion for Eberle.Rosen, who was recalled from the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League on Sunday, wristed a shot from the point that floated past Lehner to open the scoring 2:17 into the second period. The 25-year-old Rosen was playing in his fifth career NHL game, with the previous four coming last season.Toronto star forward Auston Matthews crumbled in a heap after he was hit in the foot by a shot from New York defenseman Adam Pelech in the second period. He skated slowly to the bench but remained in the game.--Field Level Media"

"Sather Steps Down as Rangers' President - The New York Times
Glen Sather resigned as the New York Rangers' president Thursday after 19 years in the team's front office, the team announced.He will take on a new job as a senior adviser to team owner James Dolan.Jeff Gorton remains the general manager, and the Rangers said they will begin a search for Sather's replacement. Sather, 75, had served as the GM for 15 seasons before Gorton took that role in 2015.""I want to thank Jim Dolan for a great partnership working together over the last 19 years, and to everyone in the Rangers organization,"" Sather said in a statement.

"The Goalie Is a Hired Gun, and He’s Yours for $50 a Game - The New York Times
TORONTO — Keith Hamilton carried himself like an N.H.L. goaltender even before he made his first save in a pickup game at Moss Park Arena. Standing 6 feet tall — and looking much bigger in skates — he made the net behind him appear to shrink. But this was hardly the N.H.L. Hamilton, 39, was guarding the cage against a team of middle-age men from an Ontario public utility. He wore a replica Colorado Avalanche jersey. Every other player was differentiated by tones more than colors, turning the sessions into light versus dark, a hockey version of shirts and skins.After an hourlong scrimmage, Hamilton cut a lonely figure as he skated off the ice. There were no handshakes, no fist bumps. He collected the cash he was promised — the going rate is about 50 Canadian dollars per game — changed out of his gear and drove off to the next arena. This was his third game of the day. He had two to go. Hamilton is a hockey mercenary, one of the estimated 150 to 200 hired guns in Toronto’s recreation leagues who are in demand as much for their position — goaltender — as  for their skills. With 143 indoor publicly owned arenas in the Toronto metropolitan area, there are many more teams than there are available goalies.Teams can do without one of their skaters. There are plenty of them. But if the goalie can’t make it, a game could be forfeited, which can feel like a puck to the mouth when ice time costs more than 400 dollars an hour.“It’s not like soccer, where a player can just go in net,” said Niki Sawni, 27, who runs a goalie-rental service called Puck App.By various estimates, there are as many as 8,000 rental-goalie orders every year in the Toronto area, which  suggests there is a sizable marketplace for the kind of person willing to play the bull’s-eye in a game of target practice.“I’ve got a screw loose, sure,” said Mark Philipps, 46, who still tends goal but not so much as a rental goalie anymore. “It takes a special type of person to want to get a puck in the head.”“You’ll run into some crazy ones,” said John McLeod, 55, a film actor who picks up work as a rental goalie in his off hours. “Very unusual characters, and I worry that I may be one of them, too.”In Toronto, rental goalies — a cohort of mostly men and a few women — generally range in age from 18 to 65 and come from all walks of life: engineering, acting, education, policing, the trades.Some even try to make itinerant goaltending their profession. Hamilton is one of those.A musician who plays the vibraphone in a six-person folk band called Beams, Hamilton said he makes more money being a rental goalie than playing music in clubs.He averages 10 games a week and keeps 40 Canadian dollars per game, paying 10 dollars in commission to a rental agency. His cut works out to about 1,600 Canadian dollars, or $1,220 in United States currency, a month. By his estimate, he has made well over 100,000 dollars in eight years as a rental goalie. And, yes, he said, he declares all of his income on his taxes.“It’s not enough for a mortgage and kids’ education, but it’s just enough to get by,” he said. “There’s certainly more taxing ways to make a living. But I sweat and I come home with bruises.”The rent-a-goalie concept has been around since at least 1985, when Doug Cardy, a former top junior goalie for the Toronto Marlboros, got tired of people “bugging me” to fill in on teams five or six times a week while he juggled a full-time job.“I started telling them, ‘I want some money,’” said Cardy, a short-haul trucker. “And I started with a little cardboard sign in one of the arenas with my phone number.”Cardy set up a business in which his goalies used pagers to check in for work. The money he scratched out wasn’t worth it, though, and Cardy, now 61, got out.Goalies Unlimited was one of the first agencies to match games with goalies, in the mid-1990s. Since then, online competitors have proliferated, with names like Book a Goalie, MyPuck, Goalies to Go, Puck App, Rent a Goalie and Get a Goalie, which serves Buffalo and Chicago. Most of the agencies are run by current or former goaltenders.Ian Peters, 44, started his operation in New York after growing tired of paying a $35 Uber fare each way to play goal in pickup games. He made a proposal three years ago to Ron Bursey, 37, who runs the Canadian operation Book a Goalie, and a New York tab was added to the Toronto-based website.“It started like wildfire and the business blew up,” said Peters, who has about 70 goalies serving New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. “I do it all from my phone. There was resistance in the beginning, because New Yorkers weren’t used to paying for this service.”Peters charges clients $70 a game, and a goalie gets $25 for his first five bookings and $30 for his next five. A goalie’s pay maxes out at $35. In Canada, rental agencies tend to take about 15 dollars in commission from the typical rate of $50 a game. Goalies like Hamilton, with eight years experience, can negotiate a lower commission. Sometimes, the business keeps it all. Daniel Smith, 57, a former high-level hockey player who became a jockey,   runs Goalies Unlimited. He likes to play four times a week, and as a rental goalie, he collects the full $50 fee each time.Puck App, which Sawni founded three years ago, markets itself as the Uber of the goalie-rental business. With a smartphone app, it can undercut other services by charging a top rate of 45 dollars in Toronto, and even less in other cities.Sawni has a database of 8,000 users across Canada, both goalies looking for paid work (about 5,000 so far) and clients looking for help in net.On Puck App, a team can specify the site, the game’s starting time and the level of play. The offer is sent to all of the goalies in the database who match the criteria.Patrick Herman, the owner of the MyPuck agency, has a roster of over 300 goaltenders and fills  orders for 15 to 20 games a day. The business can be cutthroat, he said, and he has little time for teams who try to play one service off another to get a better deal.“If you want a pizza tonight, it’s not like you call Pizza Hut and Domino’s and tell them, ‘The first delivery driver that gets to my door gets my money,’” Herman said.Some teams try to make side deals with players they like, but the agencies discourage goalies from disclosing their personal contact information to clients. Occasionally, the client is a fascinating character.Joe Vercillo, 37,  once got a late request to work for a certain Canadian superstar in the music industry. “I got a call around 12:30 at night,” said Vercillo, who is in charge of acquisitions for a small publishing company. “It woke me up. My agent said: ‘Drake has rented the ice. Can you get over in 10 minutes?’”Vercillo thought it was a prank because no one was inside the arena when he turned up. But soon Drake and his associates arrived, and Vercillo suited up for about 45 minutes of work. “They gave me 80 or 100 bucks for that,” Vercillo said. A representative for another well-known singer-songwriter  called Bursey’s agency in December 2017, requesting two goalies. Justin Bieber wanted to put together a game with some friends at a Toronto arena. “Bieber had his own entire dressing room,” Bursey said, adding that one of the goalies had told him that by the end of the game, “Teenage girls were all over the rink watching.” As at every level of the sport, some goaltenders are better than others. Daniel Altshuller, 24, a third-round draft pick of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes in 2012, became a rental goalie last year to stay sharp after taking a season off.“I had moved to Toronto and I didn’t know anybody,” Altshuller said. “I was just doing it mostly to find somewhere to play hockey.”Others enter the marketplace for decidedly less professional reasons. Dan Madeiros, a commercial airline pilot, advertises his services at $40 an hour in the online classified forum Kijiji because, he said, he just likes to play.“I have a job that pays me well,” said Madeiros, 42. “So I look at it that it’s paid exercise.”"
"Goalie Alexandar Georgiev Tries to Make the Most of His Chance With the Rangers - The New York Times
Alexandar Georgiev, an undersized goaltender no team seemed to want, was not supposed to get here.Yet there he was on Feb. 10 at Madison Square Garden, repeatedly foiling the Toronto Maple Leafs’ shooting barrage. In all, Georgiev, an undrafted rookie, made a career-high 55 saves, carrying the Rangers to a 4-1 victory in a nationally televised game on his 23rd birthday.It was the second-most saves for a goalie during a regular-season game in franchise history, after Mike Richter’s 59 on Jan. 31, 1991, but Georgiev was not upset with his teammates over all the rubber he faced.“No. No. No,” Georgiev said in a recent interview. “It was a great day to be a goalie for the New York Rangers. It was fun.”It has been a season of trying to look on the bright side for the rebuilding Rangers, who were sellers for a second consecutive trade deadline and will miss the playoffs for the second consecutive year. They have received various future assets, including young players and draft picks, and are in the process of evaluating and developing their young core.After winning the backup goaltender competition in training camp, Georgiev has posted a 12-13-3 record in 30 games, along with a 3.05 goals-against average and a .909 save percentage. Last weekend, he beat the Maple Leafs again, making 44 saves in a 2-1 victory against the league’s second-highest scoring team. On Monday, the Pittsburgh Penguins beat him, 5-2, but on Friday night, he made 44 saves again, in a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues.He has managed to learn a lot from watching Henrik Lundqvist, the longtime face of the franchise. Backups to Lundqvist rarely play, but lately the two have been sharing time between the pipes. Lundqvist has posted an .895 save percentage since Jan. 1.“His work ethic is at Hank’s level, but he’s also fast and quick like Hank,” Nick Bobrov, the Rangers’ director of European scouting, said in a reference to Lundqvist. Bobrov is primarily responsible for the Rangers’ eventually landing Georgiev. “He’s got the character and desire to be great.”Rangers fans have taken notice of Georgiev’s skills.While he made the 10-minute walk to the arena before a game from his Midtown Manhattan residence one day, a car stopped in the middle of the street and began beeping at Georgiev. A Rangers fan — who was also going to the game — jumped out of the vehicle, introduced himself, and asked if Georgiev would take a picture with his son.“I wasn’t startled or anything, but it was a bit unusual,” said Georgiev, who obliged.Georgiev took a pockmarked path to become the first Bulgarian-born player to reach the N.H.L. At 6-foot-1, he is on the short end for a pro goaltender.The prevailing stigma is that smaller goalies take up less of the net, and therefore must be lightning quick to prevent pucks from beating them. That left Georgiev on the outside looking in.“I was really disappointed about not getting drafted, and I wanted to prove people wrong,” he said. “That’s kind of been my career so far, proving to people that I can be more than they expect.”Georgiev’s parents, Georgi and Natalia, moved to Moscow from Bulgaria when their son was a year old, giving him dual citizenship.Georgiev began playing hockey when he was 5, but could not quite find his footing as a youngster in Russia. In search of improvement and opportunity, he left to attend a goalie camp in Turku, Finland, run by the former N.H.L. goalie Fredrik Norrena.Georgiev eventually earned a recommendation to join TPS Turku, a club in the top Finnish league, and continue his development. Still, playing time was hard to come by early on, with older netminders ahead of him on the depth chart.“I was sitting in the stands every game dreaming about the N.H.L. and feeling like I should be playing,” Georgiev said. “But I realized I had no control over it. So I practiced harder and tried to grind through the season.”The Rangers’ front office got its first real look at Georgiev during the 2016 world junior championships. He wound up making the Russian team in a tryout camp, beating out Ilya Samsonov, a 2015 first-round pick of the Washington Capitals, for the starting job. He backstopped the team to a silver medal after a 4-3 overtime loss to a Finland team that featured the future N.H.L. stars Patrik Laine and Mikko Rantanen.Bobrov said he was watching the tournament with the Rangers’ assistant general manager, Chris Drury. “We were saying among ourselves that it’s too bad he’s not bigger, because he’s very good,” Bobrov said.The Rangers did not draft Georgiev in 2016 or 2017, his breakout season with TPS Turku, during which he led the Finnish Elite League in goals-against average. None of the other N.H.L. teams did, either.It was not until Drury needed a goalie for the team’s A.H.L. minor league affiliate that Georgiev’s name resurfaced as a possibility.“I said we have this kid ‘Georgie’ who we’ve been watching for two to three years now,” Bobrov said. “His size isn’t traditional for the N.H.L., but he’s been proving everyone wrong his entire life, and he’s still doing it. So why don’t we try him? We took a very educated guess that this kid would turn into something special.”The Rangers invited Georgiev to their developmental camp — and after a daunting excursion to get his United States visa that included an overnight train trip — he earned an entry-level contract with the team on July 18, 2017.Benefiting from his time working with the goalie coach, Benoit Allaire, Georgiev ascended much more quickly than anticipated, overcoming a slow start in the minors as he transitioned to a smaller North American rink that features different shot angles. He made his N.H.L. debut on Feb. 22, 2018, making 38 saves in a loss at Montreal before picking up his first career win the following night at the Garden.It remains uncertain whether Georgiev will be the heir apparent for Lundqvist, who turned 37 this month and has two years left on his contract. The Rangers have another highly touted goalie prospect, 23-year-old Igor Shestyorkin, who has excelled in the Kontinental Hockey League in his native Russia. The team is in the process of bringing him to the N.H.L. next season.Regardless, Georgiev has been in this position before, and his ultimate goal remains the same.“I want to become a No. 1 goalie eventually,” he said. “And obviously help my team to win the Stanley Cup.”"

"For Islanders and Fans, There’s No Place Like Home, or Home - The New York Times
Most N.H.L. teams do not have to look up where they are playing their home games, but such is the transient nature of the Islanders this season.After 29 games of bouncing between Barclays Center in Brooklyn and Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., the team’s quirky double-home-rink situation comes to an end, for now, after Saturday’s 5-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers in Brooklyn.The Islanders’ remaining 12 regular-season home games will be at the Coliseum, the franchise’s home from 1972 to 2015. It is close to its practice facility and most players’ homes.“I never had a problem with Barclays Center, but the Coliseum is just home,’’ Islanders forward Matt Martin said. “They were great to us in Brooklyn, but the Coliseum is where you get that true Islander experience.”The disjointed season has not affected the team in the standings. After missing the playoffs the past two seasons, the Islanders (35-17-6) are surging under their new coach, Barry Trotz. They lead the Metropolitan Division ahead of the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Washington Capitals, the team Trotz coached last season.The Islanders announced Friday that the team and its fans may have to make their way back to Brooklyn in the playoffs. Should the Islanders reach the postseason, the first round of home games would be played at Nassau Coliseum, but subsequent rounds would be at Barclays Center because, according to a team statement, “Nassau Coliseum does not qualify as an N.H.L. major league facility.” Nassau Coliseum, which was renovated in the team’s absence, is the smallest arena in the N.H.L., with a capacity of about 13,900. Barclays Center, which seats 15,795 for hockey, has 100 suites; the Coliseum has only 11. Maximizing revenue means playing where more premium seats are available.It remains unclear how long the Islanders will continue to split time between two arenas and, to a degree, two fan bases.In December 2017, the Islanders, with state officials, announced plans to build a new arena adjacent to Belmont Park Race Course. About a month later, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the team would play about half of its 41 home games at Nassau Coliseum until the new arena opens in 2021. This season, the Islanders will ultimately play 21 games in Uniondale; the N.H.L. is not expected to release next season’s schedule until June.The Islanders have sold out six of their nine games in Uniondale so far, while Brooklyn games were usually at about 70 percent capacity.Attendance has suffered since the team moved to Brooklyn in 2015. This season, the Islanders are last in attendance, averaging a little less than 12,000 fans a game. But the differences in the two arenas go beyond numbers. Barclays Center, where in 2016 the Islanders won their only playoff series since 1993, was not built with a hockey rink in mind and has unusual sight lines. And most Long Island fans willing to drive to Nassau Coliseum will not often make the trek by train to Brooklyn, though the team’s playing close to Manhattan has attracted some new fans.“Barclays Center works for me,” said Ed Wiatrak, a longtime season-ticket holder who drives to Brooklyn from Staten Island for almost every game. “The Coliseum winds up costing me more with gas, tolls and parking. But I will go wherever the team is playing.”The return to the Coliseum has invigorated the fan base with the boisterous charm it had when the Islanders won the Stanley Cup four times in the 1980s. Fans are overjoyed to have the team back. The tradition of driving to Nassau Coliseum to tailgate and commiserate for hours before the opening face-off has been restored.“I prayed they would come back to the Nassau Coliseum,” said Annemarie Briskie of Wantagh. “I like the tailgating where everyone is wearing their Islander jerseys and having fun. It feels like family. If Belmont never gets built, so be it. As long as we're here. Brooklyn always felt like a stopgap.”In this renaissance season, the Islanders have benefited from being home no matter the arena. Heading into Saturday’s game, the Islanders were 6-1-2 this season on Long Island and 12-6-2 at Barclays Center.Forward Cal Clutterbuck, an Islander since 2013, said the two-arena situation may be working to the team’s advantage.“It’s a little unusual, but it’s not a negative,’’ he said. “Playing back at the Coliseum is a break from the grind of traveling back and forth to Brooklyn. It’s kind of nice.”Grace Lee, the wife of Islanders captain Anders Lee, said she relished games at the raucous Coliseum but also liked the city feel of contests in Brooklyn. “Brooklyn is so close to our friends in Manhattan, friends from college who come to the games. We have gained fans there,’’ said Lee, who grew up in Chicago and was an All-American lacrosse player at Notre Dame. “And the Coliseum atmosphere is amazing. You feel wanted and loved there. The crowd, the noise, that fan connection is very special.”"
"Lightning Ties NHL Record With 62nd Win, Beat Bruins 6-3 - The New York Times
BOSTON — The Tampa Bay Lightning won their NHL record-tying 62nd game, getting a shorthanded goal by Steven Stamkos during a three-goal second period in their 6-3 victory over the Boston Bruins on Saturday in the teams' regular-season finale.Nikita Kucherov, Anthony Cirelli, Erik Cernak and Braydon Coburn also scored for Tampa Bay (62-16-4), which tied the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings for most victories during the regular season.Six of the wins, though, came in shootouts. The league introduced shootouts to decide ties after overtime at the start of the 2005-06 season. Before that, games ended in ties after overtime, which was brought in for regular-season games in 1983.David Krejci, Danton Heinen and Matt Grzelcyk each had a goal for Boston (49-24-9), which fell one short of consecutive 50-win seasons since collecting four straight from 1970-71 through 1973-74.

EDMONTON, Alberta — The Dallas Stars' playoff prospects are looking a lot more secure.Jamie Benn scored the shootout winner and the Stars beat the Edmonton Oilers 3-2 on Thursday.Alexander Radulov and Miro Heiskanen scored in regulation for the surging Stars, who won their third straight game and tightened their hold on the first wild-card spot in the Western Conference.""There was no panic,"" Benn said of his team being down 2-0 early in the second. ""Obviously we took responsibility for our play in the first and it wasn't good enough. We wanted to come out in the second and be tighter and better and then we won the third period and took advantage in the shootout. We'll take the two points and move on.""In the conference standings, Dallas is five points up on Colorado and seven points ahead of Arizona.""I think it's the will inside that locker room and it's those players wanting not only to make the playoffs but to go in there and play the right way,"" said Stars head coach Jim Montgomery.Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid scored for the Oilers, who have lost four of six and are all but eliminated from playoff contention.Edmonton got on the board first, five minutes into the opening period just as a power play expired. McDavid sent a pass across to Draisaitl, who beat Stars goalie Anton Khudobin for his 47th of the season.Draisaitl also picked up his 100th point of the season with the goal, joining McDavid in triple digits this season. They are the first Oilers duo to crack 100 points since 1988-1989 (Jari Kurri and Jimmy Carson).""He's a guy who has been coming along and really playing good hockey,"" McDavid said. ""There has been a lot made of his game and I am really happy to see him do something like this.""It is also the first time a pair of teammates reached the mark since 2010, when Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom of the Washington Capitals accomplished the feat.""It's a nice milestone for me personally, but it is tough to be too excited about that right now,"" said Draisaitl, the first German player to hit the 100-point plateau.The Oilers added to their lead just over a minute into the second on a highlight-reel goal by McDavid.The goal was McDavid's 40th of the season, making him the first Oiler to record back-to-back 40-goal campaigns since Kurri in 1989.Dallas got one back on the power play six minutes into the first when Radulov beat Oilers goalie Mikko Koskinen high to the glove side.The Stars tied the game eight minutes into the third period when Heiskanen scored on a shot through a screen to make it 2-2.NOTE: It was the third and final meeting of the season between the two teams.

"Mantha's 1st NHL Hat Trick Helps Red Wings Beat Bruins 6-3 - The New York Times
DETROIT — The Detroit Red Wings are playing their best hockey of the season while perhaps hurting their chances of winning the NHL draft lottery.Anthony Mantha scored three goals for his first NHL hat trick, lifting Detroit to a 6-3 win over the Boston Bruins on Sunday night.Jimmy Howard had 31 saves for the Red Wings, who have won five straight for the first time this season. The run has decreased their odds of getting the No. 1 pick in the draft to possibly select American star Jack Hughes — much to the chagrin of some of their fans.""The fact that our young players are the ones that are driving this winning streak should temper some of those concerns,"" coach Jeff Blashill said. ""These are the guys that are going to make the impact than anybody we draft.""Taro Hirose scored his first NHL goal early in the third period, just 8 seconds after Mantha completed his hat trick.The 24-year-old Mantha scored twice in the opening period to give Detroit a 2-0 lead and scored again 1:17 into the third period to tie the game at 3. Hirose, who signed March 12 as a 22-year-old free agent from Michigan State, put the Red Wings up 4-3 while their fans were still roaring after the tying goal.Filip Hronek, a 21-year-old defenseman, gave Detroit a two-goal cushion with 7:57 remaining in regulation, and 22-year-old captain Dylan Larkin added an empty-net goal in the final minute.""We're just trying to enjoy the last couple of days, last week,"" Mantha said. ""It shows on the ice.""The Bruins, meanwhile, lost three of four games for the second time in March to give Toronto a chance to catch them for second place in the Atlantic Division.""We want to get to the point where we could have the luxury of resting people,"" coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We'd also like to play for what's in front of us, which is second place. We're allowing some of that opportunity to get away.""The Bruins took a one-goal lead into the third period after David Backes redirected a shot into the net with a minute left in the second. Boston's Jake DeBrusk scored early in the second and Brad Marchand tied the game midway through the period with a franchise-record 26th short-handed goal.""It's nice, but it doesn't mean as much when you don't win,"" Marchand said.Jaroslav Halak stopped 22 shots for the Bruins.Even though Detroit will miss the playoffs for a third straight year, Blashill is expected to get a two-year contract extension this week. The rebuilding franchise is developing young players such as Mantha and Larkin under Blashill and the team is competing for him even though it has been out of contention for much of the season.""They're competing hard,"" Marchand said. ""They're kind of loose right now. They're feeling it, playing really well.""NOTES: Marchand's short-handed goal broke Boston's record set by Rick Middleton between the late 1970s and late 1980s. ...

"John Tavares, Returning as an Enemy, Faces the Wrath of Islanders Fans - The New York Times
John Tavares knew that things would not be easy for him Thursday night, when he made his first visit to the Islanders since leaving them to become a Toronto Maple Leaf.Many Islanders fans, emotionally bruised by the departure of Tavares, the longtime team captain, had vowed to vent their anguish at Nassau Coliseum, expressing disgust over his decision last summer to sign as a free agent with Toronto, his hometown team.They followed through. Outside the arena before the opening face-off, several people burned No. 91 Tavares sweaters on grills or in trash cans. Others wore Tavares’s old Islanders sweater but replaced his name with “Traitor.”When Toronto took the ice for warm-ups, Tavares was greeted by a chorus of boos. Fans pressed against the glass on the visitors side of the rink chanting, “We don’t need you.”The Islanders — after surrendering the first goal — demolished the Maple Leafs, 6-1, and the acerbic chants only grew louder as Tavares was held pointless. The Islanders also won the first meeting between the teams, 4-0, in Toronto on Dec. 29.“I’m just trying to play hockey. So for everyone else, I can’t speak for them,” Tavares said after the game. “They have their feelings and it’s out of my control.”Tavares, 28, who became the face of the Islanders after they chose him first over all in the 2009 draft, expected this kind of greeting. It was inevitable that he would be cast as the villain in an arena where he long generated cheers.During his time on Long Island, Tavares was active in the community, visiting schools and hospitals every season. He played hard for lackluster Islanders squads, making the playoffs only three times in nine seasons.Tavares also worked to assimilate with a seemingly ever-changing cast of linemates and watched as close friends like Matt Moulson and Ryan Strome were traded by Garth Snow, the general manager from 2006 to 2018.Tavares was playing under a team-friendly, six-year, $33 million contract before last summer, when he became an unrestricted free agent for the first time.The Islanders could have asked Tavares to waive his no-trade clause at last year’s trade deadline to give the franchise a chance to recoup assets for him, its best player. But management and ownership chose to keep Tavares and let him reach the open market. Six teams, including the Islanders, met with Tavares before he decided to leave.He had been the foundation of the franchise for so long, it was hard to imagine a future without him. A long-term commitment to the Islanders seemed implicit in December 2017, when Tavares was present at Belmont Park as the Islanders announced plans for their future arena on the racetrack grounds.Tavares, who is soft-spoken, also frequently said last season that he hoped to stay with the Islanders. But he was ultimately swayed by the opportunity to return home, signing with the Maple Leafs for seven years and $77 million.“It was a tough pill to swallow for everyone,” Anders Lee, the captain of the Islanders this season, said recently. “As teammates, we wanted him on our team. Fans wanted the same thing.”Tavares is second in scoring for the Leafs, who are strong contenders from the Atlantic Division. He has 36 goals and 32 assists through 64 games; his career high for goals in a season is 38 in 2014-15.Without Tavares, the Islanders have become the surprise of the N.H.L. They lead the Metropolitan Division under Barry Trotz, their new coach, and are almost surely heading to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.But on Thursday, cheering for one of the best Islanders teams in years was not enough for many of the home fans.Midway through the first period, the Islanders presented a video tribute to Tavares, similar to others that have accompanied a star player’s return to his former city. When Mark Messier came back to New York after signing with Vancouver in the summer of 1997, he was reduced to tears as images of him appeared above the Garden ice.This time, the arena filled with boos and profanity, drowning out any audio from the tribute. Players from both teams watched and tapped their sticks. Tavares clapped his blue Maple Leafs gloves together several times before play resumed.“It was nice to give my appreciation for nine years here for everyone who supported me,” Tavares said.The former Islanders forward Colin McDonald was Tavares’s roommate on Long Island for two-plus seasons starting in 2013. Each attended the other’s weddings in recent summers and remain close friends. McDonald said recently that he knew Tavares’s personality would help him endure any vitriol.“John invested everything he had into that organization,” said McDonald, 34, now captain of the Lehigh Valley Phantoms in the American Hockey League. “He is human, and of course that’s not the reaction he’s looking for. But as far as learning to deal with stuff you can’t control, I have never met someone who can handle it like John.”Tavares spoke often of how he relished playing in front of the boisterous crowds at Nassau Coliseum. The cozy arena shook in April 2015 when Tavares scored an overtime winner in the playoffs against the Washington Capitals, just as it did countless other times for the star center who had 272 goals as an Islander.“I loved my time as an Islander,” Tavares said in early February, when the Leafs played the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. “Now I love being a Maple Leaf. It was the right fit for me. It was still the hardest decision I have ever made.”"

Instead the race will extend into the last two games of the season.Columbus began the day in the first wild-card slot. It could have clinched a playoff berth with a win and a Montreal loss. But Montreal beat Tampa Bay, and Carolina beat Toronto.When the dust settled, the Hurricanes were on top of the wild-card standings with 95 points. Columbus and Montreal each had 94, and the Blue Jackets hold the tiebreaker over the Canadiens.DeBrusk had two goals and an assist and Tuukka Rask made 32 saves to help the Bruins stop a two-game slide. Brad Marchand and Karson Kuhlman each had a goal and an assist, and Marcus Johansson and David Pastrnak also scored.""It's kind of the team we've been all year, right?"" Boston coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We're a good hockey club, and we don't usually lose a lot of games in a row. And we try to take care of the business at hand and correct why we lost."" Oliver Bjorkstrand extended the longest active goal streak in the NHL to six games with a third-period tally for Columbus, which had won five in a row. Matt Duchene also scored.Sergei Bobrovsky had 19 stops, but allowed four goals before being relieved by Joonas Korpisalo late in the second period. Korpisalo had three the rest of the way.""They just had really good sticks,"" Columbus forward Cam Atkinson said. ""They checked really hard and made it really hard for all of us to break out, to get into the neutral zone and even getting into the offensive zone. They played a lot better than us."" Boston got a bizarre break 1:58 into the game when a shot by DeBrusk bounced off the top of the net and straight into the air. On the way down, it hit Bobrovsky in the back and trickled in.The Bruins went up 2-0 late in the first when Johansson banged in a rebound for his first goal since being acquired in a trade with New Jersey at the deadline last month.Late in the second, Marchand tapped in a shot amid heavy traffic . DeBrusk got his second goal on a breakaway 46 seconds later, and Pastrnak made it 5-0 early in the third.Columbus answered with back-to-back power-play goals. Bjorkstrand, who has been on a tear, converted a shot from the top of the right circle. Duchene then got his 31st of the season at 9:14, but the Blue Jackets were unable to keep the momentum.Kuhlman followed with Boston's sixth goal with 9:32 left.""We got what we deserved tonight,"" Columbus coach John Tortorella said.NOTES: Marchand became the 10th player in franchise history to reach 100 points in a season. ...

Roberto Luongo made 28 saves.""I thought we played a lot harder defensively,"" Boughner said. ""My talk before the game was not so much about x's and o's, it's about competing and winning your one-on-one battles and I thought we did a lot more of that.""In a difficult season on and off the ice, Brady Tkachuk is becoming the face of the franchise for the Senators.Tkachuk and Colin White scored for the Senators, who had their three-game home winning streak snapped. Anders Nilsson made 29 saves.Tkachuk, the fourth overall pick in last year's draft has 20 goals this season and tied a single-game franchise mark with 12 shots on goal.""Tkachuk was sensational,"" interim head coach Marc Crawford said. ""That's as good a game I've seen from anybody, let alone a rookie, this year.""The 19-year-old Tkachuk tied Alexandre Daigle for most goals in a season by a teenager with the Senators. With 12 shots Thursday, he also tied Jason York's single-game franchise record, set in 1999.""We've all been excited about how he's played all year,"" Crawford said. ""It's been a process for him. He's a very bright kid who continues to learn each and every outing. There's very few games where he doesn't give you a total committed effort.""While Tkachuk was excited to hit the 20-goal mark, he was disappointed by the loss.""It's nice, but at the end of the day we didn't get the two points,"" said Tkachuk.Trailing 3-1 to start the third, the Senators made it a one-goal game on Tkachuk's 20th.Hunt and Huberdeau each scored empty-net goals to seal the win for FloridaTied 1-1 to start the second, the Panthers had a solid period and went in front 3-1.Just as in the first period, the Panthers scored an early goal in the second when Brouwer grabbed a rebound in front and backhanded a shot past Nilsson just two minutes in.Less than four minutes later, Florida made it 3-1 as Huberdeau took a great pass from captain Aleksander Barkov and beat Nilsson from close range for his 26th of the season.The teams were tied 1-1 after 20 minutes.Florida scored 30 seconds into the game when Dadonov deflected a shot by Barkov.The Senators tied the game at the 12-minute mark as White took the puck in his own end and cut through Florida's defense, beating Luongo on the glove side.While he didn't pick up a point, Florida's Brady Keeper made a significant impact in his NHL debut. The 22-year-old undrafted defenseman from the University of Maine signed with the Panthers on Monday, making him the first person from the Pimicikamak Cree Nation to make it to the NHL.Before the game, the Senators welcomed members of First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities and held a ceremonial puck drop. Keeper was invited to take the faceoff in place of Barkov to commemorate the event.""It means a lot,"" Keeper said of taking the faceoff.

BOSTON — Panthers forward Troy Brouwer was the first to the puck as it rolled into the Boston zone, with three Bruins chasing helplessly behind him.He reared back for a slap shot, freezing Tuukka Rask as the goaltender ventured a bit too far out of the crease. Then Brouwer brought his stick back down to the ice and wristed the puck past Rask, high on the stick side, for a short-handed goal that restored Florida's two-goal lead.""They had just cut the deficit to one goal and they were on the power play,"" Panthers goalie Roberto Luongo said after Saturday's 4-1 victory over Boston.

But just 1:07 later, with the Bruins on their first power play of the game, Brouwer made it 3-1.Rask said he was slightly out of position because he had been tempted to go play the puck himself.""That's one of those shots you'd like to save,"" he said.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba — Jordan Eberle had a feeling the New York Islanders could pull off a comeback against the Winnipeg Jets — even when the situation appeared dire.Eberle certainly did his part to make it happen.Eberle scored 33 seconds after Casey Cizikas had the tying goal late in the third period to lift the Islanders to a 5-4 win over the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday night.""Just the mindset of our bench, you could feel it,"" Eberle said. ""We felt like we were going to come back. We liked the way we were playing. We were creating chances.""Cizikas took advantage when Winnipeg couldn't clear the puck and scored at 18:14 to make it 4-4. Eberle recorded his second goal of the game at 18:47 when he got into the crease and beat Connor Hellebuyck to complete the rally for the Islanders, who trailed 4-2 early in the third period.Eberle also picked up an assist and Ryan Pulock had three of his own. Mathew Barzal ended a 19-game goal drought with his 11th of the season, and Anders Lee scored his 28th for New York, which moved two points ahead of Pittsburgh and into second place in the Metropolitan Division. The Islanders are three points back of first-place Washington.Robin Lehner stopped 33 shots for the Isles, who are 4-4 in their last eight games.""Wow. Wow. This is absolutely incredible,"" Lehner said. ""I know nothing is done yet, but we really needed this one.""They're such a great hockey team over there. They were dangerous all night and we scrambled together and didn't give up. It's one of the most fun wins I've had in a long, long time. So proud of this group, man. This was a huge game for us.""Adam Lowry scored twice and added one assist, while Brandon Tanev had one goal and a pair of assists for Winnipeg. Mark Scheifele scored his 36th of the season, and Nathan Beaulieu and Jacob Trouba each added a pair of assists.Hellebuyck made 39 saves for Winnipeg (45-28-4), which is two points ahead of idle Nashville for first place in the Central Division.""Good start, bad finish, so it's frustrating,"" Lowry said.The third-line duo of Lowry and Tanev sparked Winnipeg to a 2-0 lead.Lowry put the Jets up 1-0 just 13 seconds into the game when Tanev's wraparound led to a rebound and the puck went off Lowry's skate. A review showed no kicking motion.Lowry then netted his 11th goal of the season when he redirected Trouba's shot past Lehner at 6:11 of the first.Barzal ended his scoring drought four minutes later with a quick shot from the slot that beat Hellebuyck on the blocker side to make it 2-1.While a pair of Islanders each had a stick break, Tanev took advantage and scored his first goal in 18 games at 3:46 of the second period.New York soon had a two-man advantage for 1:32. Lee tipped Pulock's blast to cut Winnipeg's lead to 3-2 at 6:06.The Islanders ended the middle period with their fourth power play of the game that carried over into the third, but didn't deliver the equalizer.Winnipeg used its third power play of the game for Scheifele's tip of Trouba's shot at 6:46 of the third, but Eberle scored off a rebound 63 seconds later to make it 4-3.""We got a little loopy, a little careless and they were able to capitalize,"" Jets captain Blake Wheeler said of the Islanders' scoring splurge in the final minutes. ""When they tie the game, we've got to be mature enough to shut the game down and get a point and time to battle it out in overtime or a shootout. We've done that a few times now. That's something we can learn from.""The Jets came up empty on a power play with six minutes remaining, then Hellebuyck made a snapping glove save on Eberle with three minutes to go.""You look at what we could have done better,"" Tanev said, ""but at the same time you go to practice with your head held high and move on to the next one.""UP NEXTIslanders: home vs. Buffalo on Saturday.Jets: finishes a four-game homestand Saturday when they plays their final game of the regular season at Bell MTS Place against Montreal.___"
"Steel Records 1st Hat Trick as Ducks Beat Canucks 5-4 - The New York Times
VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Bo Horvat wanted to see three solid periods of play from his Vancouver Canucks teammates.Instead, the center was frustrated as the Canucks dropped their third straight game, losing 5-4 to the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday night.""We had like a 30-minute lull again. And we can't be doing that. Our team's got to play a full 60 minutes,"" Horvat said.The Canucks rallied from a 5-2 deficit late in the third period, but couldn't complete the comeback.""We showed what we can do there in the last 10 minutes of the game,"" Horvat said. ""We were all over them in their zone all the time. And we've got to play like that every single game, all the time, every shift, everybody.""Rookie Sam Steel recorded his first NHL hat trick to lead the Ducks. The 21-year-old Steel became the youngest player in Anaheim's franchise history to complete the feat in the regular season.""It's pretty special to accomplish that, and to do it in a win is even better,"" Steel said.Rickard Rakell and Kiefer Sherwood also scored for the Ducks.Jake Virtanen, Alex Edler, Josh Leivo and Tanner Pearson scored for the Canucks.Jacob Markstrom made 19 saves for Vancouver. Anaheim's John Gibson had 28 saves.Despite the win, the Ducks were eliminated from playoffs contention after the Arizona Coyotes beat the Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday.The Ducks first goal of the game was the result of a bobbled offensive play by the Canucks.Josh Teves had his shot blocked and his defensive partner Alex Biega fell trying to corral the puck.Steel picked it up, beating Teves and Canucks rookie Elias Pettersson down the ice for a breakaway. He got a wrist shot past Markstrom to open the scoring 9:09 into the first period.He added another goal 12:16 into the second, scoring off a rebound.Steel completed the hat trick before the end of the second period.Canucks center Markus Granlund was called for hitting a broken stick near the blue line that careened into the puck.The rules say a penalty shot should be awarded if a player in his defensive zone throws or shoots a stick or any other piece at the puck or another player carrying the puck.Steel's backhand shot sailed over Markstrom's glove. The 21-year-old was playing just his 18th NHL game.""I didn't really try to move (the stick) where the puck was going. But he passed the puck at the same time,"" said Granlund. ""I made a mistake there and obviously it cost us. It's tough.""The Ducks picked Steel 30th overall in the 2016 draft and he was called up from the American Hockey League on Saturday when center Ryan Getzlaf was scratched from Anaheim's lineup with an upper-body injury.Virtanen put the Canucks on the board 12:48 into the first, grabbing the puck in the neutral zone and streaking up ice. He took a back-handed shot near the goal line. The puck hit the skate of Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler and slid through Gibson's legs.Edler added another goal with just a minute to go in the first period, scoring on a shot from the point through traffic. The shot hit Anaheim's Corey Perry and bounced in past Gibson.The goal was the 93rd of Edler's career, tying him with Mattias Ohlund for most goals by a defenseman in Canucks' history.Rakell added a power-play goal for Anaheim 7:44 into the third after Teves was called for hooking.Minutes later, Sherwood scored on a shot from the point.Leivo brought the Canucks back within two 13:34 into the third period, scoring on a wrist shot over Gibson's glove.Pearson swatted a puck through heavy traffic in front of the Anaheim net and beat a diving Gibson to add Vancouver's final goal with just over five minutes to go.NOTES: Steel is the youngest player in Ducks history to score a hat trick in the regular season. ...

"Andrerson Gets 2nd Shutout, Senators Beat Sabres 4-0 - The New York Times
OTTAWA, Ontario — Craig Anderson endured some trying times this season, and now the Ottawa Senators' goalie is enjoying the good times.Anderson stopped 35 shots for his second shutout of the season and the Ottawa Senators beat the Buffalo Sabres 4-0 Tuesday night.Anderson went 97 days this season without a victory. He picked up a win on Saturday in a 4-3 overtime decision against Edmonton. That was his first victory since Dec. 17.He followed that performance with Tuesday's shutout.""I thought the guys all fought really hard, especially at the end, so that kind of shows the chemistry and togetherness that has developed here,"" said interim head coach Marc Crawford. ""I think they recognized it was a big win for Craig the other night and now to follow that up with the type of performance he had tonight I think guys were really pushing to make sure they didn't make any miscues to give up the shutout.""The Senators know how rough some nights have been for Anderson, as he's often had to face more than 40 shots.""He's been facing so many shots every night and we never made it easy for him and he's always stood there and tried to do his best,"" said Thomas Chabot, who had two assists. ""Last game he won his first game in a while and (Tuesday) to get a shutout is what he deserves. He played so well all year. He's been so huge for us so he totally deserves that.""Brian Gibbons had a goal and an assist, and Anthony Duclair, Rudolfs Balcers and Magnus Paajarvi also scored.The Senators won the first of a four-game homestand after going 1-2-0 on a three-game trip through Western Canada.Ottawa has won its last three home games and outscored those opponents 12-2.Carter Hutton made 27 saves for Buffalo, which lost its fourth straight.Coming off a disappointing 3-1 loss to New Jersey on Monday, the Sabres completed their three-game road trip 0-3-0. Buffalo is 1-10-1 in its last 12 and 0-11-2 in its last 13 road games.""We're just giving up too much,"" Kyle Okposo said. ""We gave up two tap ins, a power-play goal and I can't remember the first one. It's a lack of respect for our net. I didn't think we were ready to play (Tuesday) and that's pretty inexcusable.I'm running out of things to say.""Okposo made no excuses for the team's performance.""I just don't think we have that sense of urgency every time that we step on the ice,"" said Okposo. ""We've got six games left, we've got to show some emotion, we've got to play. We've got to play and (Tuesday) was just not good enough.""After a solid first two periods the Senators extended their lead early in the third.Ottawa took a 3-0 lead on a Balcers power-play goal at 5:54, and less than two minutes later made it 4-0 as Paajarvi scored his 10th of the season off a great passing sequence. It's the second time in Paajarvi's career that he reached the 10-goal mark.Trailing 2-0, the Sabres had a much better second period, but were unable to beat Anderson.""Everyone has to be better, this is the National Hockey League,"" said captain Jack Eichel. ""We've got to be better, everyone, myself, everybody. Everybody has to be better. We can't go out and play like that and expect to win.""Buffalo's best opportunities came on the power play, but despite some solid chances, the Sabres could not find the back of the net.The Senators jumped out to a 2-0, first period lead on goals from Duclair and Gibbons.Duclair scored at the 17-minute mark, taking a pass down low and beating Hutton with a backhander.

"Ovechkin Nets 50th, 51st Goals in Caps' 6-3 Win vs Lightning - The New York Times
TAMPA, Fla. — Alex Ovechkin reached 50 goals — again. And, then he added another for good measure while leading the Washington Capitals to a big victory.The Washington star scored his 50th and 51st goals of the season in a 6-3 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday night.He has 658 career goals, moving past Brendan Shanahan for 13th on the all-time list. Ovechkin also hit the 50-goal mark for the eighth time in his career — a total surpassed only by Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy, who had 50 or more nine times.""I've had a couple of chances in previous years to score 50, but I didn't,"" Ovechkin said. ""You always want to do something special, obviously, but sometimes it's hard. I'm happy to get it done.""T.J. Oshie and Nicklas Backstrom also scored twice, while Braden Holtby finished with 28 saves as the Capitals won their fourth consecutive game and hold a three-point lead over the New York Islanders for the top spot in the Metropolitan Division.Nikita Kucherov scored his 39th goal of the season to increase his league-leading points total to 122. Tyler Johnson and J.T. Miller also scored for Tampa Bay, which played its final home game of the regular season. Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 31 shots as the Lightning suffered their 15th regulation loss of the season.Ovechkin hit the 50-goal mark at the 14:35 mark of the third period, one-timing a cross-ice pass from Oshie at the bottom of the right circle past Vasilevskiy. He added his second of the game 1:40 later on the power play, hammering a one-timer from the top of the left circle off a feed from John Carlson for his 247th career power play goal to tie Luc Robitaille for fourth most in league history.With a four-goal lead on Edmonton's Leon Draisatl for the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league's leading goal scorer, Ovechkin is attempting to top the NHL in that category for the eighth time in his career — which would be an NHL record.""I think it goes under the radar a little bit how many games he's played,"" Washington right wing Tom Wilson said. ""He's always in. He's always playing hard. They haven't been easy miles on him. He's done it hard and he's played that way for a long time and he's continues to just blow the roof off with his goal scoring. We're pretty lucky to have him around and he deserves it for sure.""At the age of 33, Ovechkin is also on pace to be the oldest player since Phil Esposito in 1974-75 to lead the league in goals.""It's been, obviously, a phenomenal milestone year for him and it's going to continue to be for the next few years as well,"" Washington head coach Todd Reirden said. ""We're so fortunate to have this player in Washington and playing for the Capitals. A generational talent. And, you know, the NHL is fortunate to have a guy like this. We're spoiled in Washington for sure, but the whole National Hockey League is spoiled to have a guy like this. I'm happy for him because he put the work in.

PITTSBURGH — Pekka Rinne's difficulties against the Penguins, particularly in Pittsburgh, have been well documented.So, it felt good for the Nashville Predators' star goaltender to put those questions to rest — at least for one night.Rinne stopped 42 shots to lead the Predators to a 3-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday night.""It hasn't been an easy building for me, personally,"" Rinne said, ""and for us as a team, either.""It was the second game in eight days between the teams and a rematch of the 2017 Stanley Cup Final, won by Pittsburgh in six games.Rinne won for the first time in Pittsburgh and defeated the Penguins for just the second time in 10 career regular-season starts. In six previous career starts in Pittsburgh, including the playoffs, Rinne was 0-6-0 with a 5.14 goals-against average and a .822 save percentage. He allowed three goals or more in every other appearance in Pittsburgh.""Those kinds of things, you kind of recognize them and it's in the back of your head, but at the same time, it's always a great challenge and I love to come here and play,"" Rinne said.Viktor Arvidsson's 32nd goal of the season - a power-play goal - set a career high and also was the 100th of his NHL career. Craig Smith and P.K. Subban also scored for the Predators, who moved into a first-place tie in the Central Division. Nashville, which clinched its fifth straight playoff berth Monday, has won five of seven after losing four of its previous six.""It's a good game for us to have at this point in the season,"" Rinne said. ""There's only a few games left before the playoffs. Every team is trying to fine-tune their game before the playoffs and we're trying to do the same.""Rinne was 63 seconds from his fifth shutout of the season when Nick Bjugstad scored for Pittsburgh.Matt Murray made 23 saves for the Penguins, whose three-game winning streak ended. Pittsburgh, which had a chance to tie the New York Islanders for second in the Metropolitan Division, came in having won 10 of 15 games and earned points in 14 of 16.""I thought we had some really good chances in the first period,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""You can't always control whether it goes in the net. Their goalie was good, you have to give him credit, but I thought our team battled hard.""Rinne allowed 12 goals and made just 34 saves during three 2017 Stanley Cup Final games in Pittsburgh. He was strong on Friday, stopping 22 first-period shots. Rinne has eight wins and one shutout in his last 13 starts total.

It was the fourth time this season the Penguins recorded 20 or more shots in a period.Smith scored the lone goal of the period for Nashville when he deflected Matt Irwin's point shot behind Murray.""They were shooting a lot of pucks in the first period,"" Rinne said. ""They shot every chance they had, and obviously that helps you get going, seeing the puck and starting to feel it. It just continued like that all night. I thought we played strong periods in the second and third.""Arvidsson scored a power-play goal from inside the top of the left circle at 17:36 of the second period to put Nashville in front by two goals. Ryan Johansen had an assist on the goal to become the second player in team history to record a 50-assist season.Rinne took care of the rest for the Predators.""He can turn a game around with one save,"" Arvidsson said.

"Pastrnak's Hat Trick, 5 Points Carry Bruins Past Rangers 6-3 - The New York Times
BOSTON — It certainly appears David Pastrnak has worked the rust off.Pastrnak had three goals and two assists for a career-high five points Wednesday night, sending the Boston Bruins to a 6-3 victory over the New York Rangers.Playing his fifth game since missing 16 following left thumb surgery, the winger raised his goal total to a team-leading 36.""Pretty close,"" Boston coach Bruce Cassidy said when asked if Pastrnak is fully recovered. ""Obviously, a great night. He was firing the puck well. It looked like he was more comfortable handling it in traffic.""Coming off a 3-1 road trip but disappointed after blowing a two-goal lead Monday night against NHL-best Tampa Bay, the Bruins broke it open with four goals in the third period for their 12th consecutive victory at home. It's their longest streak since winning 14 straight during the 2008-09 season.Pastrnak completed his fourth career hat trick and third this season with a power-play goal to make it 4-2 with 7:08 to play, triggering a flow of hats that littered the ice. He became the first Bruins player with a trio of hat tricks in one season since Hall of Famer Cam Neely in 1993-94.""It helps a lot for me coming back from after a long time (away),"" Pastrnak said. ""It was a little bit tough at the beginning.""The Bruins had gone 1-7-2 in their last 10 games against the Rangers, including losing the first two meetings this season.Backup goalie Jaroslav Halak made 20 saves. Jake DeBrusk, Charlie McAvoy and Patrice Bergeron also scored for Boston, which went 4 for 6 on the power play.""It's hard enough to win in this league when you don't beat yourself,"" Rangers coach David Quinn said. ""We did a lot of good things early, hanging around a good hockey team, then just imploded.""Mika Zibanejad had two goals and Ryan Strome also scored for the Rangers, who have lost six of seven as the season nears a close. Their rebuilding project continues after dealing away eight players off the roster at the past two trade deadlines.Henrik Lundqvist stopped 26 shots, losing for just the second time in his last nine games against the Bruins. He made a highlight-reel save midway into the first period on Chris Wagner when he lunged across the crease to make a stick save.""They have a lot of good players, but first, to win any games we have to play smart,"" Lundqvist said. ""We can't have two too many men on the ice (penalties), for example. There's no excuse for that.""Pastrnak's second goal broke a 1-all tie at 9:15 of the second. It came off a nice setup from David Krejci, who cut around Rangers defenseman Tony DeAngelo and shifted from forehand to backhand before slipping a cross-ice pass to the winger, who sent a one-timer into the net from the right circle.Pastrnak then made a beautiful cross-ice pass to DeBrusk, who made it a two-goal lead 3:19 into the third.With the Rangers short-handed following their first too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty, Pastrnak one-timed a feed from Brad Marchand, moving Boston ahead 2:48 into the game.The Rangers tied it with a power-play goal of their own when Strome sent Zibanejad in alone and he reached back to slip a forehand behind Halak as he was moving across the edge of the crease at 16:29 of the first period.NOTES: The Bruins announced they've reached a 10-year agreement with their AHL affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island. They've been together continually since 1992. ...

"No Canada: Nation's Stanley Cup Drought Approaches 26 Years - The New York Times
Whenever Eric Desjardins reunites with his 1993 Montreal Canadiens teammates, the topic of Canada's ongoing Stanley Cup drought doesn't come up in conversation.""We don't see it that way. Canadian team, American team, it's just that we were part of the NHL,"" the former star defenseman said. ""Sure, it's been a while in Montreal, but we don't really talk about the 26 years.""That's right. With the NHL playoffs set to open Wednesday, it will be going on 26 years since the Canadiens — or any other Canadian team — brought home the Cup.Desjardins, who enjoyed a 17-year career split between Montreal and Philadelphia, chalks up the drought to NHL expansion across the United States and league-wide parity ushered in with the introduction of the salary cap in 2005.""It's supposed to be our national sport, and we're supposed to be the best at it,"" said Desjardins, who's from Montreal. ""But now, the way the league's structured I think it could go anywhere. ... I think anybody can win it now. And I think it makes it more interesting.""Still, the 49-year-old acknowledged a quarter century between Cups in Canada is far too long, and Desjardins can see himself rooting for any Canadian team making it to this year's Final.""If the Final's between Pittsburgh and Winnipeg, yeah I would root, even though I like Pittsburgh,"" he said. ""But yeah, against Calgary, Winnipeg, I would cheer for the Canadian team.""Canada's Cup hopes this spring rest on three teams — Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto — to end the drought. Of course, most current Canadian-born NHL players weren't alive to see Desjardins and Co. celebrate their five-game series win over the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings.Sabres forward Jason Pominville is among the exceptions.He was 10 when his hometown Habs won, and Pominville still vividly recalls Game 2 of the series in which Desjardins scored all three goals in Montreal's 3-2 overtime win after the Canadiens lost the opener.""I remember watching that and celebrating in my living room, and fist-pumping when he scored,"" Pominville said. ""I was a big fan of Gretzky, too. But when you're in Montreal, it's tough not to root for that team when you're growing up.""In Montreal, there was a time when winning the Cup was considered a birthright. The Canadiens still top the list with 24 championships, 23 coming after the NHL was founded in 1917.And yet, Montreal hasn't reached the Final since '93, while only five Canadian teams have done so; Vancouver is the only one to make two appearances during the drought, in 1994 and 2011.Then there are the Maple Leafs, who haven't reached the Final since winning the Cup in 1967, the last year of the NHL's Original Six era.The low point might have been the 2016 playoffs, the first since 1970 to not feature a Canadian teamThis was not always the case. From 1927 to 1995, the lengthiest stretch for a Canadian team not appearing in the Final was two years. It last happened in 1991-92, when Pittsburgh won consecutive championships by beating Minnesota and Chicago.As for Canada's lengthiest Cup drought before the '93 Habs, it was a six-year span from 1936-41.The current drought has gone on for so long, former executive-turned broadcaster Brian Burke said the math simply doesn't add up.""It doesn't make sense. There's 31 teams, so seven out of 31 teams, a Canadian team should win every four-and-a-half years,"" said Burke, who has worked in the front offices in Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary.The problem, Burke said, is Canadian teams are at a disadvantage because many players don't want to play north of the border for several reasons.The first, he said, is a lack of privacy and the amount of pressure placed on players to win north of the border. Burke said a large number of players, including Canadians, often list all seven Canadian teams on the no-trade clauses of their contracts.""Even in Calgary, we had our lists where players got to put 10 teams on a no-trade list, and all the Canadian teams were on those lists,"" he said.The second issue is Canada's taxation rate.""There's no privacy. Horrible personal criticisms on social media, and then you take home way less money, so it's pretty easy,"" Burke said.He can only imagine how much national attention will be paid to the next Canadian team to win it all.""The next GM that wins a Cup in Canada, they'll be naming schools after him, and streets,"" Burke said.Don't think Flames GM Brad Treliving hasn't given ending the drought some thought.""Hey, that's all you dream about,"" he said, while attempting to keep the pressures of winning in Canada in perspective.""You got to bed at night and it's no different than any other manager or any other person involved in the game: That's what you want to accomplish"" Treliving said. ""If you really put the energy and the effort into doing the right things, the results will come.""Having lost in the Final twice, Desjardins can't remember a sweeter moment than winning the Cup.""It's a reward that's indescribable,"" Desjardins said. ""When you win, you can share it. You share it with your teammates, you share it with the coaching staff.""In Canada, it will be shared with an entire nation.____AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed.___"
"US-Based NWHL OKs Plan to Expand to Canada After CWHL Folds - The New York Times
The National Women's Hockey League is moving swiftly to expand to Toronto and Montreal following the demise of its Canadian-based rival.NWHL Commissioner Dani Rylan told The Associated Press on Tuesday the league's board had approved an investment plan to establish teams in Canada's two largest cities for the start of next season. Rylan also said her league has received a commitment from the NHL that will make it one of the NWHLs biggest financial sponsors.The decision by the U.S.-based NWHL to cross the border and expand from five teams to seven comes just two days after the Canadian Women's Hockey League abruptly announced it will cease operations by May 1 due to financial issues. The CWHL had four teams in Canada, one in suburban Boston and a sixth in China, and its decision after 12 seasons was seen as a major blow to the sport.""The news definitely came as a shock to us on Sunday morning, but it was obvious that we needed to do what we could to provide for those players to have a place to play this fall,"" Rylan said by phone. ""The focus of ours was to figure out a solution for Canada first, and we're fortunate we were able to do that pretty quickly here.""Rylan said the expansion decision and NHL's increased backing weren't exactly connected. She instead views the NHL's increased financial support as ""an endorsement of our business and the brands that we're growing.""Rylan did not reveal how much additional money the NWHL will receive above the NHL's $50,000 previous annual commitment. The NHL also contributed $50,000 to support the CWHL.NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly confirmed the league has increased its financial support. Daly, however, cautioned the additional support doesn't change the NHL's position in fully backing a women's pro sports league.Daly referred to what he wrote on Sunday in response to the CWHL's collapse.""We recognize the importance of women having options to play the game at the professional level. If those options were to become unavailable in the future, we would certainly consider doing what's necessary to fill that void,"" Daly wrote. ""But that's not the case currently.""NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman previously told The AP he was hesitant about the league assuming control of the CWHL or NWHL or both because, as he put it, ""we don't believe in their models."" At the time, he emphasized the importance of starting with a clean slate.The CWHL operated liked Major League Soccer by owning each of its teams, except for the one based in Shenzhen, China. Starting in 2017-18, it began paying player salaries ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 out of a total budget of $3.7 million. The NWHL has relied on private investors and was the first to pay players a salary.The shifting fortunes for pro women's hockey in its hotbed of North America has come with most of the world's top players in Finland for the world championships, which open on Thursday. Many players tweeted their disappointment on Sunday and Canada's national team issued a statement Tuesday.""We are disappointed and shocked to learn of the CWHL's plan to shut down league operations,"" the team said. ""There are many unanswered questions about the future, but we will continue to create dialogue with our teammates, fellow players and leagues. Our priority as players is to move forward and advance the game at all levels, and to ensure female hockey players have a viable league for the future.""CWHL Calgary general manager Kristen Hagg posted a statement on her Twitter account saying former league officials continue ""evaluate all the options on the table and plan to work in solidarity.""The statement adds there are no talks taking place between former CWHL teams and the NWHL.Rylan previously had merger discussions with CWHL officials in a bid to form one North American league rather than have two leagues competing for the same pool of sponsorship money and investor backing.With the CWHL ceasing operations, Rylan said she can now work to fulfilling the vision she had when establishing the NWHL in 2015.""A lot of stakeholders and brands have been hesitant to invest in women's hockey because there was a decision to make before, the CWHL or NWHL,"" Rylan said.""And now there's no decision,"" she added. ""We are the league to do business with and we are continuing conversations and exploring conversation, and eager to accept that business this offseason.""Without going into detail, Rylan didn't rule out the possibility of adding more expansion teams before the start of next season.___"
"Sid for Selke? Crosby's Versatile Game Expanding for Pens - The New York Times
PITTSBURGH — Casey DeSmith has seen it at every stop of his hockey career. Practice comes, the focus shifts to defending and the guys paid lavishly to score goals take their foot off the gas.""I've had people on every single team I've ever played on like that, obviously,"" the Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender said. ""It just comes with the territory of being a gifted offensive player.""There is an exception. Then again, there almost always is when it comes to Sidney Crosby.The Penguins captain — whose resume is stuffed with six 100-point seasons, a pair of scoring titles and two Hart Trophies as the NHL's Most Valuable Player — has long been respected and feared for his creative playmaking.It's his leadership and conscientious approach to every aspect of the game while stewarding the Penguins through a rocky season to a 13th straight playoff berth that has put the 31-year-old into the conversation for the Selke Trophy, given annually to the NHL's top defensive forward.Both the metrics and the eye test heading into Pittsburgh's first-round matchup with the New York Islanders provide a compelling case.Crosby won more than 55% of his faceoffs this season, his best mark since 2009-10. He blocked 43 shots and took away the puck from an opponent 54 times, the second-highest total of his career. After a talk with coach Mike Sullivan last fall, Crosby occasionally found himself killing penalties, a role he embraced and would have happily kept doing if not for concerns over his workload.Still, there are situations when Sullivan knows he needs the star he calls ""the best 200-foot player in the game"" to go do his thing. Nursing a one-goal lead late against Carolina on March 31, Sullivan sent Crosby over the boards over and over and over as the clock dwindled. Pittsburgh held the Hurricanes at bay and emerged with a crucial 3-1 win.""He was out there three of the last five minutes, defending the six-on-five, defending the five-on-four,"" Sullivan said. ""He was the one guy that was dominant in the faceoff circle. I thought his defensive effort was on display.""Hall of Famer Sergei Fedorov was the last player to capture the Selke while scoring 100 points, doing it for Detroit in 1996. Crosby has an outside shot at joining that exclusive company when the league awards are announced in June. Not that Crosby, who has never finished higher than seventh in Selke voting, seems to care.""I'm still trying to figure it out, to be honest with you,"" Crosby said. ""I think it's still something, you're trying to ingrain those habits and be in the right positions. I think experience helps that. You realize that it can help you offensively to be good defensively too. It's not as bad as sometimes you think it needs to be. I think that's part of it.""Or maybe more than a part of it.Pittsburgh center Matt Cullen, at 42 the league's oldest player, has carved out a 21-year career due in large part to his defensive expertise. Around the time he hit 30, Cullen knew he needed to find different ways to contribute beyond trying to put the puck in the net if he wanted to stick around. He sees Crosby taking some of the same steps not out of necessity but by choice, which makes it all the more impressive.""I think Sid's the best example of a guy that has that growth mindset as far as he's never completely satisfied with where he's at,"" Cullen said. ""He's always evolving and learning and adapting to different situations.""Cullen likened Crosby to Michael Jordan, who was named to the NBA's All-Defensive team nine times in addition to winning 10 scoring titles and leading the Chicago Bulls to six championships.""Sid's accepted all the challenges of playing against the top lines and then going out and scoring, too,"" Cullen said.Forward Jared McCann arrived in a trade with Florida on Feb. 1. The 22-year-old grew up admiring Crosby from afar. The up-close look has been even more revealing. McCann will find himself transfixed on Crosby's No. 87 during film sessions, studying the subtle aspects of Crosby's play in Pittsburgh's end looking for tips that might translate to his own game, be it positioning, physicality or a sense on knowing where the puck is headed before it gets there.""I kind of catch myself moving a little bit too much, kind of circling too much,"" McCann said. ""I see him stop his feet and then read the play, see where it's going to go and then go. I feel like as a young player, as much as you can watch him in the defensive zone, you should learn from him.""Coach Peter Laviolette has spent more than a decade trying to find ways to deal with Crosby during stops in Carolina, Philadelphia and now Nashville, with only occasional success.""Never once did it cross my mind to think maybe we could put somebody on the ice and take advantage of him,"" Laviolette said. ""It's just that I think his offense overshadows (his defense) sometimes because he's an elite offensive player.""Which Sullivan believes separates Crosby from annual Selke contenders like Boston's Patrice Bergeron and Los Angeles' Anze Kopitar.""He's the most dangerous guy with the puck,"" Sullivan said. ""He also has the ability to score goals at the other end of the rink in quick strike better than any of the other players in conversation.""Opportunities that typically begin with Crosby in the defensive zone, doing the dirty work others won't in an effort to produce the highlights few can.""His ability to win faceoffs, his puck protection, his strength on the puck, his ability to control the game, all of those things, as important as they are on the offensive side of the puck, they're just as important on the defensive side,"" Predators defenseman PK Subban said.""When he decides, he's going to come back into the zone, get the puck and take it out of the zone, he's going to do it.""___"
"Hurricanes Earn 4-1 Win Over Leafs - The New York Times
TORONTO — The Carolina Hurricanes had a lot on the line entering Tuesday's game against Toronto in their dash for a playoff spot.The Maple Leafs didn't — and it certainly showed.Justin Williams and Dougie Hamilton each banked in goals from behind Toronto's net as the Hurricanes picked up two big points in the Eastern Conference wild-card race with a 4-1 victory over the listless Leafs.""It's exciting,"" said Hamilton, who also added an empty-netter. ""We've been playing playoff hockey for a while now.""Jordan Staal also scored and Petr Mrazek stopped 23 shots for Carolina, which came in having lost three of its past four in regulation as the franchise looks to make the postseason for the first time since 2009 — currently the NHL's longest streak of playoff futility.The Hurricanes, who were 27th in the overall standings at the end of December, moved into the East's first wild-card spot, a point up on both the Columbus Blue Jackets and ninth-place Montreal Canadiens.Columbus lost 6-2 to the Boston Bruins on Tuesday, while Montreal beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-2. All three teams battling for the East's two wild-card berths have two games left on the schedule.""We've had a good stretch,"" Hamilton added. ""Hopefully we can keep going for two more games and see where that takes us.""John Tavares scored his 47th goal of the season for Toronto. Garret Sparks made 33 saves.The Leafs clinched a playoff spot for a third consecutive spring with Monday's 2-1 road victory over the New York Islanders to set up a second-straight first-round matchup with the Bruins.Playing its third game in four nights, Toronto entered four points back of Boston for second in the Atlantic Division, and home ice in the opening round, but is now guaranteed to start on the road at TD Garden following Tuesday's results.""We were just a little sluggish to start coming off (Monday) and obviously (playing) a team that was extremely desperate,"" Tavares said. ""We just have to be at a better level than we were to start.""Toronto fell behind 2-0 at 2:13 of the second period on a Carolina power play with Martin Marincin in the box for interference. Sparks made a desperation save on Hamilton at the side of the crease, but the Hurricanes defenseman managed to bank his follow-up effort off the netminder's right leg from below the goal line — Carolina's second from behind the Leafs' net — for the Toronto native's 17th of the season.The crowd jeered the home side's first shot of the period, and third of the game, less than four minutes into the second, but the Leafs would eventually get on the board when Tavares buried his own rebound on a man advantage at 10:55 to add to his career-high goal and point totals.Patrick Marleau tipped a shot just wide of Carolina's goal five minutes into the third as Toronto started to push before Mrazek robbed both William Nylander and Kasperi Kapanen on point-blank chances.But the Hurricanes hemmed the Leafs into their own zone midway through the period, with Staal firing a wrist shot from the high slot for his 10th to make it 3-1 at 9:36.""Clean shot,"" Sparks said. ""Gotta make the save.""Hamilton then added his second into an empty net with under a minute to play for his career-high 18th.""Big points,"" Staal said. ""They've got some talented players. They created a few chances and Mrazek was there for us.""Sparks, who got the nod after Andersen made 28 saves in Monday's victory, struggled on Carolina's opener in the first for the lethargic Leafs.Tavares won a defensive zone draw, but Williams beat Ron Hainsey to the puck and swept a one-handed effort from below the goal line that somehow got between the netminder's skate and the near post for his 23rd.""It came to the wrong spot — exactly where I didn't need it to go,"" Sparks said. ""It's just a tough bounce.""Lucas Wallmark had a down-and-out Sparks at his mercy earlier in the period, but rang a shot off the iron.Toronto appeared to go ahead 1-0 when Nylander took a pass from Auston Matthews and beat Mrazek on a 2-on-1 rush at 15:01, but the Hurricanes correctly challenged for offside.The Leafs' two shots in the opening 20 minutes matched their season low in a first period, something that didn't surprise Toronto coach Mike Babcock, considering what was on the line for both teams.""It was a different level of emotional engagement,"" he said. ""I don't think that's a big surprise for anybody who's a human being.""NOTES: Curtis McElhinney, whom the Leafs lost to the Hurricanes before the season in favor of keeping Sparks, dressed as Carolina's backup. The veteran McElhinney is 19-11-2 this season with a 2.57 goals-against average and a .912 save percentage. Sparks, 10 years McElhinney's junior, came into Tuesday 8-8-1 with a 3.15 GAA and a .901 save percentage. ... Tavares has 88 points, just two back of Mitch Marner's 90 for the team lead. ... Andersen is scheduled to start Thursday's visit by Tampa and Saturday's regular-season finale in Montreal. ... Boston beat Toronto in seven games in last year's playoffs. ...

"Alexis Lafrenière Would Rather You Didn’t Compare Him to Sidney Crosby - The New York Times
RIMOUSKI, Quebec — The walls inside Sun Life Financial Coliseum in this eastern Quebec town along the Saint Lawrence River are swathed in tributes to the history of the Rimouski Oceanic, which entered the competitive ranks of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1995.There are homages to former players like Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards, who in 2000 led the club to its only Memorial Cup, Canadian junior hockey’s ultimate prize. Naturally, there is plenty of space dedicated to Sidney Crosby, the superstar who played two seasons in Rimouski.There’s a new player causing a stir among the locals — 17-year-old Alexis Lafrenière — and he will not even be eligible for the N.H.L. draft until 2020.With a remarkable season and a standout international career, Lafrenière has been drawing comparisons to Crosby, whose talent belied his age 15 years ago before being drafted first over all by the Pittsburgh Penguins.A native of Saint Eustache, Quebec, a suburb just west of Montreal, Lafrenière dismisses such comparisons. But in a proud province whose die-hard hockey fans have waited some time for the next French Canadian superstar, he has been forced to contend with some lofty expectations.“He played in Rimouski, and I did too. That’s something people say,” Lafrenière said. “But I’m not Crosby. I just try to be myself and play my game. If I can watch Crosby play and do things like he do, for sure I will do it to try to get better, but I don’t think I’m Crosby.”Like Crosby, Lafrenière was selected first over all by Rimouski in the Q.M.J.H.L. draft. And like Crosby, Lafrenière dominated the league at 16, being named the league’s top rookie last season as well as a first-team All-Star. His 42 goals last season were the most for a 16-year-old in the league since Crosby in 2003-4.In February, Lafrenière went on a 12-game tear in which he collected eight goals and 23 points, the highest single-month point total in his junior hockey career. He finished the regular season last weekend with 105 points, tied for second in the league, behind only Rouyn-Noranda forward Peter Abbandonato, a player almost three and a half years Lafrenière’s senior.“We haven’t felt this kind of response since Sidney,” the Oceanic owner Alex Tanguay said. “It’s a different kind of response, obviously with the social media and stuff, but you can definitely feel a vibe around him. Back then, if you wanted to see Sid play, you needed to drive down to Rimouski.“Now in 2019, you can know what type of player Alexis is just by watching him on the internet or on TV. I guess it’s a different kind of response, but in a way the same vibe we felt almost 15 years ago.”Any dominant 16-year-old hockey player naturally draws comparisons to Crosby, one of Canada’s most fabled native sons. But Lafrenière’s dominance has not been confined to the league colloquially known as the Q.At the 2018 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup, the top international tournament for players 17 and younger, Lafrenière tied for the scoring lead despite being the second-youngest player on his team. He sealed Canada’s tournament victory with two goals, including the winner, in the final against Sweden.In December and January, he was the youngest player to compete at the International Ice Hockey Federation world junior championship, for players 20 and younger. In part because of injuries to other players, Lafrenière became the ninth youngest to compete for Canada at the annual holiday tournament, behind names like Wayne Gretzky, Connor McDavid, Eric Lindros and, of course, Crosby.But Lafrenière’s world junior showcase was not exactly a grand coronation. Canada, the host nation, lost in the quarterfinal to Finland, the eventual champion. After a third-period benching against Switzerland in group play, Lafrenière encountered the first real adversity of his young career. He responded with a goal against the Czech Republic in the next game.“This goal was probably one of the biggest of my career in front of so much people,” he said. “At World Juniors, scoring a goal is really special.”The Rimouski coach and general manager, Serge Beausoleil, added: “In many ways, it helped him. It’s one of the first times that he faced adversity. He has to react to that. That’s really good for him. He’s a tremendous player, but he has room for improvement.”Aside from their biographical similarities, Lafrenière and Crosby differ drastically in style. Whereas Crosby’s legend was built on subtlety and the facility with which he makes the extraordinary appear ordinary, Lafrenière is more the showman. He appears most in his element driving offensive play with the puck on his stick. It’s a style he adopted as a child emulating his favorite player, the Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane.A fastidious student of the game, Lafrenière can still describe a personal favorite pass from Kane to then-teammate Marian Hossa.“The pass to Hossa,” he recalled. “He spin around and back door. That was pretty sick.”Lafrenière is expected to be a prominent player in next season’s world junior tournament in the Czech Republic. By then, every game he plays will draw the kind of scrutiny reserved for a player expected to go No. 1 in the N.H.L. draft.The last Quebecois player selected first over all was goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in 2003. The last nongoalie from Quebec to go first was Lecavalier in 1998. That’s a startling drought for a province known as the proving ground for icons like Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau, Gilbert Perreault, Guy Lafleur, Mario Lemieux, Ray Bourque and Patrick Roy.Lafrenière would be thrilled to bring Quebec back to the top of the N.H.L. draft board.“Just to be drafted is a dream,” he said. “If I had the chance to go first over all, that would be something really special.”But with plenty of hockey to play before the 2020 N.H.L. draft, Rimouski’s lively fans are looking forward to a few more indelible moments with their young superstar. Lafrenière’s agent announced in February that he would return to the Oceanic for the 2019-20 season after reports that he had been approached by professional clubs in Europe.“He’s our best player at 17 years old,” Beausoleil said. “At times, we’re really demanding because we love him. It’s good to see that he has something to learn. That’s a long process.”"
"Ted Lindsay, Hall of Fame Scorer Who Powered Red Wings, Dies at 93 - The New York Times
Ted Lindsay, a Hall of Fame player who packed a fierce combativeness in a slight frame as he helped the Detroit Red Wings win four Stanley Cup championship titles, died on Monday at his home in Oakland Township, Mich. He was 93.Lew LaPaugh, a son-in-law and the president of the Ted Lindsay Foundation, which raises money for autism research, confirmed the death.Lindsay, nicknamed Terrible Ted, played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League, 14 of them with the Red Wings, coming out of retirement for the final one. He was the first N.H.L. player to play 1,000 games, a first-team All Star eight times and a participant in 11 All-Star games. The Red Wings named him their captain.Lindsay could be scrappy off the ice as well. In the mid-1950s he led an initially unsuccessful effort to create a players’ union, for which he paid a price.In Detroit, Lindsay is revered as part of a celebrated triumvirate, the Production Line, in which he played left wing alongside Gordie Howe at right wing and Sid Abel at center. He was the last surviving member of that trio.All three were elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, Lindsay in 1966, a year after his final retirement, when the three-year waiting period for eligibility was waived. And all three are remembered at the Red Wings’ new home, the Little Caesars Arena (as they were at the team’s previous home, Joe Louis Arena), where oversize jerseys hang from the rafters bearing their retired numbers — Howe’s 9, Abel’s 12 and Lindsay’s 7.In 1950, Lindsay won the Art Ross Trophy as the league’s scoring champion; Abel finished second and Howe third. In all, in 1,068 regular-season games, Lindsay recorded 379 goals and 472 assists for 851 points, making him at the time the highest-scoring left wing.A battler on the ice, perhaps to compensate for his size — 5-foot-8 and about 165 pounds — he was heavily penalized, too. He spent 1,808 minutes in the penalty box, the equivalent of 30 games.“I was born a poor loser,” he told The New York Times in 1973, explaining his feistiness. “I wouldn’t talk to anyone who wasn’t on my team.”Bill Chadwick, a Hall of Fame referee, spent many nights trying to keep Lindsay under control. “Ted was a mean hockey player,” Chadwick once said, “but he was the kind of guy I would have wanted to play for me. He’d do anything to get the puck in the net.”Robert Blake Theodore Lindsay was born on July 29, 1925, in Renfrew, Ontario, the home of one of professional hockey’s premiere teams in its early years, the Renfrew Millionaires. Ted’s father, Bert, was a star goaltender for the team and played as well in the early N.H.L. His mother, Maude (Villemarie) Lindsay, was a homemaker.In 1929, with the onset of the Depression, the family moved to Kirkland Lake, Ontario, where Bert Lindsay worked in the gold mines and where Ted grew up.After two years in junior hockey, he joined the Red Wings at 19 in 1944 and remained with them until 1957. That was the year Lindsay led a group that tried to establish a players’ union.Lindsay took his plans to Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamsters union boss, who told him that professional athletes did not need a union. Jack Adams, the Red Wings’ longtime general manager, had another response: He traded Lindsay to the Chicago Blackhawks.Lindsay recalled that in his first game against his old team, he smacked Howe over the head. Howe remembered, too. “I laid him out,” Howe said. “Then I asked him if this was the way he wanted to play.”Lindsay got up off the ice, he said, and replied, “No, I guess it’s not worth breaking up a friendship.”After the Lindsay trade, the new N.H.L. Players’ Association filed a $3 million federal antitrust suit, calling the league a dictatorship. Four months later, in February 1958, the players dropped the suit and plans for a union when the club owners agreed to a $7,000 salary minimum and a 60-percent increase in pension benefits.The players now have a union, the National Hockey League Players’ Association, and the average salary is about $3 million a year.Lindsay played three seasons in Chicago (1957-60), retired for four seasons and returned to Detroit for one more, 1964-65.During his time in Detroit, the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in 1950, defeating the Rangers, 4 games to 3; in 1952, sweeping the Montreal Canadiens, 4-0; and in 1954 and 1955, beating the Canadiens each time, 4-3. In 133 playoff games, Lindsay had 47 goals and 49 assists for 96 points.He later became general manager of the Red Wings (1977-80) and coached them for nine games in the 1979-80 season and 20 games in 1980-81. His coaching record was 5-21-3.In later years, Lindsay was a television hockey analyst and a manufacturer’s representative.He is survived by a son, Blake; two daughters, Lynn Lindsay LaPaugh and Meredith Berman; a stepdaughter, Leslie Richardson; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.In their playing heyday, Lindsay, Howe and Abel were good friends as well as Production Line teammates. “There was a place we used to meet for drinks after a workout or a game,” Abel, who died in 2000, once said.Howe saw them as the quintessence of teamwork. “They used to say that if you blindfolded us, we’d still be able to find one another,” he said. “All of us knew where everyone else was at any given moment. Maybe the closeness off the ice had something to do with it.”"
"For the First Time, an N.H.L. Game Is Broadcast in Plains Cree - The New York Times
MONTREAL — Fred Sasakamoose thought this day would never come.Sasakamoose, the N.H.L.’s first Indigenous player when he skated in 11 games with the Chicago Black Hawks during the 1953-54 season, watched from the Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation in northern Saskatchewan on Sunday night as the Montreal Canadiens battled the Carolina Hurricanes — and heard his own language.It was the first N.H.L. broadcast in Plains Cree, the Algonquian language he grew up speaking.“It makes me so proud that they’re going to broadcast the game in my language,” he said in a telephone interview before the game.“I heard people broadcast local tournaments, the Indian Stanley Cup they call them. This evening I am going to listen to the game and understand, because I’m a Cree Indian.”Sunday’s production was born out of discussions between Sportsnet, the league’s Canadian national TV rights holder, and the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a Canadian cable channel dedicated to promoting the country’s Indigenous heritage.Community leaders approached Sportsnet last year, wanting to continue the work done at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, where A.P.T.N. aired 10 hours a day of coverage in a mix of Indigenous, French and English languages.“As a group, we discussed how to use hockey and tie it in with the Cree language,” said Rob Corte, Sportsnet’s vice president of N.H.L. production. “It was a very informative, interesting and emotional meeting, and we left there thinking that we wanted to do something.”The broadcasters Clarence Iron, Earl Wood, Jason Chamakese and John Chabot, an eight-year N.H.L. veteran and former assistant coach with the Islanders, called the game from the A.P.T.N. studios in Winnipeg, Manitoba, via a live feed provided by Sportsnet.“It’s very monumental in that a lot of our people struggle on an everyday basis because of their disconnection from their everyday self,” said Wood, who hosted the studio show. “A lot of our young people are shy about speaking the language. If they hear it on the mainstream media, we can use this to our advantage for the retention of our language.”One of the biggest challenges for the broadcast team was finding words in Plains Cree that describe the in-game hockey events and projecting them quickly enough during the real-time action.The commentators built their vocabulary during the 2010 Olympics, when A.P.T.N. covered hockey in Cree. They developed words by talking with community elders and Plains Cree speakers.“The puck itself, we call it napakiwānis, which is something that is pressed down,” Iron said.Other terms like kocīw (he shoots), osīhēw pīhtokwahēw (he scores), kipahwāw (penalty), and tako (overtime) translate more directly from English.The game also served as a showcase for the league’s most prominent Indigenous player, Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price, whose mother is a former chief of the Ulkatcho First Nation in northern British Columbia. During a stellar career that has seen him become the Canadiens’ franchise leader in wins, Price has supported Indigenous youth by hosting them at games.“I feel like this game is meant for everybody,” Price said this month after winning his 315th career game to pass Jacques Plante for first place in franchise history. “It’s obviously a league motto, but I definitely have seen that first hand. I think it’s important that you need to be proud of where you come from and enjoy the game for what it is.”Lining up opposite Price on Sunday was Hurricanes forward Micheal Ferland, who is Cree. The Hurricanes won, 2-1, in overtime.The trailblazing Sasakamoose acknowledged the hardships that Indigenous Canadians still face, including significantly higher rates of suicide and alcoholism. Nights like Sunday, with Indigenous ice hockey stars showcased on national television in their own language, have the potential to inspire youth and make them proud of the heritage, he added.Sasakamoose spent years at one of Canada’s notorious residential schools, a government-supported program that for a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children by separating them from their families and often forbidding them from speaking their Native languages.“This is going to create opportunities for young people,” he said. “They’re going to change the world for our young people by giving them that chance, that someday they too could be the same as the Micheal Ferlands on TV.”"
"Red Wings, Blashill Agree to Two-Year Contract Extension - The New York Times
Coach Jeff Blashill and the Detroit Red Wings have agreed on a two-year contract extension, general manager Ken Holland announced Tuesday.A Detroit native, Blashill, 45, is in his fourth season as coach of the Red Wings. He has compiled a 135-143-47 since his hiring on June 9, 2015. Despite his relatively short time behind the Red Wings' bench, he is the seventh-longest tenured head coach in the NHL.""I think that Jeff has done a very, very good job considering the circumstances of a rebuild,"" Holland told reporters. ""I think on a night-to-night basis, our team has been very, very competitive. I think we've been involved in close to the most one-goal games in the league this year. When I look at the development of the young players on our team, as we've gone through this rebuild, they've all improved, they've all gotten better.""When I hired Jeff as a coach, he was the second-youngest coach in the National Hockey League and he's been behind the bench now for four years. I think he's learned a lot in four years behind the bench of a National Hockey League team and I want to put that experience to good use as we go forward in this rebuild. I'm very, very excited to announce that Jeff's coming back for two more years.""The Red Wings are 31-38-10 (72 points) and out of the NHL playoff picture with three games to play.In his first season, the Red Wings finished 41-30-11 and lost in the first round of the 2015-16 playoffs to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Red Wings have not qualified for the postseason since.--Field Level Media"
"Andy Hebenton, N.H.L. Ironman with 630 Consecutive Games, Dies at 89 - The New York Times
Andy Hebenton, who never missed a game during eight seasons with the New York Rangers and a final season with the Boston Bruins in setting a record at the time of 630 consecutive National Hockey League appearances, died on Tuesday in Gresham, Ore. He was 89.His death, at an assisted living facility near Portland, was confirmed by his son Clay, who said he had congestive heart failure.Hebenton was only 5 feet 9 inches and 180 pounds or so but was essentially indestructible, playing on right wing in the old six-team N.H.L. during the 1950s and ’60s, when players had yet to wear helmets and brawls were common.He appeared in 216 straight games in the minors before the Rangers obtained him in 1955 and, coincidentally, another 216 consecutive games in the minor leagues after the Bruins released him in 1964.Hebenton’s streak of 1,062 consecutive professional games, in both the minor and major leagues, ended in the 1967-68 season, when he left the Portland Buckaroos of the Western Hockey League to attend the funeral of his father, Robert, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.Hebenton eclipsed the N.H.L. record of 580 consecutive games played, set by Johnny Wilson, a wing, who skated for four teams. Doug Jarvis is now No. 1 on the ironman list, having appeared in 964 straight games with three teams in the 1970s and ′80s.Hebenton’s closest call to missing an N.H.L. game came in the 1956-57 season, when he won the league’s Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly play combined with exceptional talent.In a game at the old Madison Square Garden, he was poked in the eye with a stick, causing the lid to puff up.“It shut so tight I couldn’t see at all,” Hebenton told Sports Illustrated in 1967. “But somehow our club doctor managed to squeeze drops of some kind into it the next night in Montreal. The eye opened up a little, just enough so that I could get into the game.”Hebenton was among the top 10 goal-scorers three times during his N.H.L. career. His highest point total came in the 1958-59 season when he scored 33 goals and had 29 assists, No. 3 on the Rangers in total points behind the future Hall of Fame wing Andy Bathgate and center Red Sullivan. He played in the 1960 N.H.L. All-Star Game.But, as he told it, he wasn’t especially a home-crowd favorite; many Ranger fans, he said, felt he wasn’t tough enough. He incurred only 80 penalty minutes as a Ranger and appeared six times among the top five in balloting for the Lady Byng award.When Hebenton lost seven teeth on the ice in a two-week period in January 1961, The New York Times took notice with an article headlined “Hebenton Puts Teeth in His Game: Quiet Ranger Is Still Not Angry after Losing Seven.”Hebenton figured that the fans would finally be satisfied.“I got my teeth knocked out, so now they should have no complaints,” he told The Times. “I admire guys who are tough and mean, and maybe I’d get more recognition if I was a mean guy. But when you go around knocking everybody down, you’re too tired to put a puck in the net. I was hired to score goals, not to sit in the penalty box.”Andrew Alexander Hebenton was born on Oct. 3, 1929, in Winnipeg. He received his first pair of skates when he was 5 and tried them out in a backyard rink built by his father, a city Parks Department worker.He was obtained by the Rangers after playing in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Western Hockey League.Hebenton finished second to Glenn Hall, the Detroit Red Wings’ goalie and a future Hall of Famer, in the balloting for the 1955-1956 Calder Cup as the N.H.L. rookie of the year; he had scored 24 goals with 14 assists.His most memorable goal came during the first overtime in Game 2 of the Rangers-Montreal Canadiens Stanley Cup semifinals in 1957. Skating along the right boards, he put a 15-foot shot past goalie Jacques Plante to give the Rangers a 4-3 victory. But the Canadiens captured the series, 4 games to 1, and won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Bruins in the finals.The Rangers reached the playoffs four times during Hebenton’s years with them, but never made it to the championship round.The Bruins selected Hebenton for a fee of $20,000 in the N.H.L. draft after the 1962-63 season. He scored 12 goals in his only season with them. He was then sent to the minors and never returned to the N.H.L., playing mostly in the Western Hockey League for Portland and the Victoria Maple Leafs before retiring at 45.He later owned a cement contracting business in the Portland area.In addition to his son Clay, who was a goalie with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the World Hockey Association for two seasons in the 1970s, Hebenton is survived by another son, Tim; three daughters, Melanie Walker, Karen Hebenton and Terry Fisher; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His wife, Gael (Beveridge) Hebenton, died in 2014.In describing how he didn’t satisfy the blood lust of some Ranger fans, Hebenton told The Times that he had showed grit going back to childhood.“I was knocked down by a bus when I was 4 and hit in the head with a baseball bat when I was 6,” he said. “Now what is there to be scared about in a hockey game?”"
"NHL Roundup: Islanders Down Sabres, Clinch Playoff Spot - The New York Times
Anthony Beauvillier scored twice Saturday night for the New York Islanders, who capped one of the most remarkable stories of the NHL regular season by clinching a playoff berth with a 5-1 win over the visiting Buffalo Sabres.Jordan Eberle, Michael Dal Colle and Ryan Pulock also scored for the Islanders (46-26-7), who will return to the playoffs for the first time since 2016 thanks to a raucous victory in a building they thought they'd left in the spring of 2015.The Islanders moved from Nassau Coliseum to Brooklyn's Barclays Center following the 2014-15 season but began splitting their home schedule between the two arenas this season as they wait for construction to begin on a proposed hockey-only building at the Nassau/Queens border.The Islanders are 12-6-2 at the Coliseum and will close out their home schedule there Monday. They will be hosting the Toronto Maple Leafs and former teammate John Tavares in the home finale. All first-round home games will be played at the Coliseum. Should New York advance, it will head back to Barclays Center for home games in subsequent rounds.Hurricanes 5, Flyers 2Carolina scored twice on power plays in a victory in Raleigh, N.C., which eliminated Philadelphia from playoff contention.Teuvo Teravainen, Dougie Hamilton, Justin Faulk, Jaccob Slavin and Brock McGinn scored for the Hurricanes, who strengthened their hold on the top Eastern Conference wild-card spot.The Hurricanes scored two goals in a 21-second span in the first period to wipe out a one-goal deficit and later added two empty-net goals.Blue Jackets 5, Predators 2Cam Atkinson scored twice to tie the franchise record for goals in a season, and Artemi Panarin collected four assists to set a team record for points in a campaign as visiting Columbus beat Nashville to remain in a playoff spot.Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 23 shots for the Blue Jackets (44-30-4, 92 points), who have won four straight and are one point back of the Hurricanes for the first wild-card spot. Columbus is tied with the Montreal Canadiens, but holds the second wild-card spot with the tiebreaker.Nashville's two-game winning streak was snapped on a night the Predators (44-29-6, 94 points) failed to take advantage of an opportunity to claim the top spot in the Central Division.Canadiens 3, Jets 1Joel Armia, Jeff Petry and Jordan Weal all scored as visiting Montreal held on to claim a win over Winnipeg that was crucial to their playoff hopes.Montreal goalie Carey Price stopped 23 shots in a victory that keeps his team in the thick of the playoff race, along with fellow wild-card candidates Carolina and Columbus.Montreal (42-29-8, 92 points) is on a 5-1-1 roll, though the Canadiens have one fewer game remaining than the Hurricanes and Blue Jackets.Senators 4, Maple Leafs 2Anthony Duclair scored twice, including an empty-netter, as Ottawa defeated visiting Toronto, which missed a chance to clinch a playoff berth.Craig Anderson made 42 saves for the last-place Senators, who improved to 6-7-1 under interim coach Marc Crawford.Magnus Paajarvi and Cody Ceci also scored for Ottawa, which took a 2-0 lead into the third period before the Maple Leafs tied it with goals 27 seconds apart. Brady Tkachuk and Colin White each had two assists for the Senators.Capitals 6, Lightning 3Alex Ovechkin scored twice to eclipse the 50-goal mark, and Nicklas Backstrom and T.J. Oshie each had two goals and an assist as visiting Washington beat Tampa Bay.Ovechkin scored from the low slot at 14:35 of the third period, marking the eighth time he has reached the 50-goal milestone, and his 51st came less than two minutes later on the power play. Only Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy, each with nine, have more 50-goal seasons.Goaltender Braden Holtby stopped 25 shots to win his 31st game for the Capitals, who have won 14 of their last 19 and salvaged the final meeting in the three-game season series (1-1-1) over 15 days against Tampa Bay.Sharks 4, Golden Knights 3 (OT)Brent Burns' power-play goal 22 seconds into overtime lifted San Jose over visiting Vegas, ending a season-worst losing streak at seven games.Burns one-timed a pass on the Sharks' first possession in the offensive zone in overtime. San Jose held a 4-on-3 advantage after Colin's Miller's hooking penalty on Evander Kane with less than a minute to play in regulation.Tomas Hertl, Kane and Marc-Edouard Vlasic tallied goals, while Logan Couture had two assists for the Sharks, who split the four-game season series against Vegas. Martin Jones made 23 saves to win for the first time in seven decisions.Blues 3, Devils 2 (OT)Defenseman Vince Dunn scored 4:56 into overtime as visiting St. Louis recorded its 11th straight victory over New Jersey, in Newark, N.J.With time winding down in overtime, Dunn skated into the offensive zone and tucked the puck between the pads of Cory Schneider for his fifth career game-winning goal and his fourth this season.Tyler Bozak scored to record his 400th career point, and rookie Robert Thomas also tallied for the Blues (42-28-8), who have won five of their last six games. Jake Allen finished with 25 saves to improve to 7-0-0 in his career against New Jersey.Ducks 5, Oilers 1Rickard Rakell notched a natural hat trick in the second period, and visiting Anaheim all but eliminated Edmonton from the playoffs for the 12th time in 13 seasons.Goalie John Gibson made 30 saves for the Ducks (33-37-10, 76 points), who have long been eliminated from the playoff picture.The chances of Edmonton (34-35-9, 77 points) reaching the postseason were on life support, but the loss essentially sealed the club's fate. The Oilers are eight points out of a playoff position with four games remaining.Canucks 3, Stars 2 (SO)Markus Granlund's goal in the eighth round of the shootout gave Vancouver a home-ice win over Dallas.Granlund slipped the puck through Dallas goaltender Anton Khudobin's legs. Granlund was the lone scorer in the shootout.The Canucks (34-35-10, 78 points) won their second straight game, but the victory was moot because they were eliminated from NHL playoff contention on Friday. The Stars (41-31-7, 89 points) missed a chance to clinch a postseason berth, as they suffered their first loss in four games and their first road setback in eight games.Kings 3, Blackhawks 2 (OT)Drew Doughty scored with 12 seconds remaining in overtime as Los Angeles dealt a major blow to visiting Chicago's fading playoff chances.Playing with a one-man advantage after a late penalty by the Blackhawks' Jonathan Toews, Doughty powered in his game-winner from the top of the right circle and through Chicago goaltender Corey Crawford. It was Doughty's seventh goal of the season.Austin Wagner and Michael Amadio also scored for the Kings. Amadio's goal with just over four minutes remaining in regulation sent the game into overtime.Panthers 4, Bruins 1Boston's 12-game home-ice win streak was snapped by visiting Florida.The Bruins' streak was their longest since 2008-2009. It was the first Bruins home loss since Jan. 31.Riley Sheahan and Troy Brouwer scored once, and Evgenii Dadonov scored twice, including an empty-netter, for the Panthers. Roberto Luongo earned the win by making 30 saves.--Field Level Media"
"Glen Sather Steps Down as Rangers President; Islanders Stay in Second - The New York Times
The Hall of Fame executive Glen Sather is stepping down as the president of the Rangers and will assume a new role as senior adviser to the team owner, James L. Dolan.Sather’s move comes after 19 years with the Rangers in which he served the first 15 as team’s president and general manager. He ceded general manager duties to the longtime assistant Jeff Gorton before the 2015-16 season.The team will immediately begin a search for a new president, Dolan said Thursday. The Rangers join the Ottawa Senators as N.H.L. teams looking for a president to oversee hockey operations. Gorton will remain general manager.The Rangers made the playoffs 12 times with Sather and reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2014. They will not make the postseason this year. Sather’s 556 wins as general manager are the most in franchise history.“Glen has become one of the most successful executives in Rangers history, and his current strategy has set the team on the right path to achieve our ultimate goal,” Dolan said.“Glen and I will work closely together to identify his successor. We thank Glen for his dedication to the Rangers, and to all of hockey, and look forward to his continued contributions to our team in his advisory role.”Before joining the Rangers, Sather spent roughly two decades with the Edmonton Oilers and helped them win the Stanley Cup five times as general manager and coach. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the builder category in 1997.While Sather’s finest work came building the Oilers’ dynasty, he also brought the Rangers back to respectability after some down years in the late 1990s. When he handed the day-to-day reins to Gorton, it marked a shift in organizational philosophy that now includes a rebuilding effort with young players.“I want to thank Jim Dolan for a great partnership working together over the last 19 years and to everyone in the Rangers organization,” Sather said.“I truly believe the team is headed in the right direction and think the future is bright. I look forward to transitioning to a different role and continuing to play a part in building the next Rangers Stanley Cup contender.”ISLANDERS 2, PANTHERS 1 Brock Nelson scored in the second period and then got the winner in the fourth round of the shootout to give the Islanders a win at Florida.Thomas Greiss finished with 28 saves through overtime and thwarted all four Florida attempts in the tiebreaker as the Islanders won for the third time in four games.The Islanders will not win the Metropolitan Division, as Washington clinched first with a 2-1 victory at home against Montreal. But they remained two points ahead of Pittsburgh for second place and home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. The Islanders need just one point in the season finale in Washington on Saturday to clinch second.“You look at our record home and away, they’re almost identical,” Islanders Coach Barry Trotz said. “We don’t change the way we play on the road, at home. Would we like home-ice advantage? Yes, we would for our fans.”Jonathan Huberdeau scored the tying goal for the Panthers with 7 minutes 15 seconds left in the third period, and Sam Montembeault had 35 saves in his 10th N.H.L. start.HURRICANES 3, DEVILS 1 Justin Faulk scored the go-ahead goal in the second period, and host Carolina clinched its first playoff berth since 2009 by beating the Devils.The victory, coupled with Montreal’s loss at Washington, wrapped up Carolina’s second postseason berth since it won the Stanley Cup in 2006. The Hurricanes had the league’s longest active playoff drought.“We’re excited, we’re obviously happy,” said Faulk, who has played 558 N.H.L. games, none in the playoffs. “But we’re not done, and that’s not enough just to get into the playoffs, and we know that.”.Andy Greene scored and Cory Schneider stopped 22 shots for the Devils, who have lost three of four and have clinched last place in the Metropolitan Division."

Nominally a story about the transformative power of sports, it is, like many supposed sports novels (and films, for that matter, and TV shows), actually about friendship, morality and achievement. Whether you have any feelings at all about hockey (I don’t, really), it is impossible not to get swept up in these kids’ lives and what they learn on the ice. At a time when a lot of cynicism is about to be attached to the whole concept of an athlete, there is a purity here, a sense of pain and joy, that has nothing to do with hackneyed metaphors and everything to do with compelling characters and a wrenching story, beautifully told.

"David Quinn’s Rangers Get Many Teachable Moments, but Few Wins - The New York Times
On the day after February’s trade deadline stripped the Rangers of three key veterans, David Quinn’s whistle pierced the practice rink air. The coach barked with the rasp of a well-worn instructor’s voice, “That can’t happen.” The Rangers reran the drill, which Quinn this time punctuated with “good job.”An hour into the session, Quinn skated in to speak quietly with Brendan Lemieux during a defensive routine. Lemieux, the 23-year-old prospect acquired in a trade for Kevin Hayes, had met Quinn only that morning after joining from the Winnipeg Jets.“That’s what was really cool about my first practice,” Lemieux said afterward. “I was already learning things, being taught. I guess that goes to what kind of coach he is. He’s a teacher. There are a lot of N.H.L. coaches that aren’t like that.”With the Rangers more than a year into a rebuild, teaching a young team has been Quinn’s primary objective. Ten players on the Rangers’ roster are 23 or younger. Entering the final game of the season, the Rangers have just four wins in 19 games since the trade deadline on Feb. 25, though seven losses were by a single goal, including four in overtime.“We were close, but that doesn’t cut it in this league,” Quinn said.He arrived in New York last May after five years as the head coach at Boston University and more than two decades leading or assisting predominantly A.H.L., college and national team development programs. Quinn’s own promising playing career came to an abrupt end in college with the diagnosis of hemophilia and a life-threatening injury.“When you look at what he’s gone through as a coach in order to reach the pinnacle of the game, not a lot of people would go through what Quinny has gone through,” said Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan, a former teammate at B.U. “I think that’s a reflection of his love of the sport but also his competitive nature.”General Manager Jeff Gorton called Quinn’s track record with young players a huge part of his appeal. That recent history included work with four first-round picks while leading B.U., a group headlined by the Buffalo Sabres star Jack Eichel. Quinn, 52, had taken over for the longtime coach Jack Parker — for whom Quinn played in the 1980s — and he expected to spend his career there even as three N.H.L. teams called to gauge his interest.But, Quinn said, “It’s the New York Rangers.”“I really don’t think I ever would have left B.U. for any other situation, or people, or organization than this,” he added. “Everything aligned. Every single thing.”Quinn has so often preached his desire that the Rangers play “fast, physical, and relentless” hockey that some players refer to the phrase as “our team slogan.” His first season was notable for its hard practices, blunt postgame assessments and healthy scratches. Quinn’s players, past and present, consistently mention his honest and direct style of giving feedback.“He’s very good at communicating, but he’s so smart about the way he does it, too,” Eichel said.Sabres forward Evan Rodrigues, who played his junior and senior seasons at B.U. under Quinn, had a goal and an assist in his first game for Quinn in October 2013. Afterward, Quinn asked the player for a self-evaluation. Rodrigues said, “Probably like a B, B+.” Quinn replied, “Well, I give you a C-.”In hindsight, Rodrigues realized his coach was right.“I don’t doubt much that he says,” Rodrigues said, before adding: “I’m very, very thankful for him because I don’t think I’d be where I am today if it weren’t for him.”Quinn attributed that plain-spoken manner partly to his father — “an old-school Irish cop” — and to his sudden diagnosis as a college sophomore with hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease.“Life experiences form all of us,” he said. “I think that is probably why I’m so direct with people because of what I’ve been through personally. I really believe those experiences — because I really struggled for two years after that. Then I got back on my feet and went, ‘All right, hey, look how lucky I am, really.’”After Quinn dealt with persistent bruising throughout the 1985-86 season, B.U.’s team physician suggested he get blood work after the playoffs. The tests showed hemophilia.“I’m 20 years old and I think I’m going to play in the N.H.L. and I think I’m going to play for the ’88 Olympic team,” Quinn said. “You’re talking about a big kick in the teeth, you know? I’m trying to scramble. What am I going to do with my life? I had my next 15 years mapped out. I was a first-round pick, I’m going to play in the N.H.L. And I went through some tough times, but I always thought to myself, ‘The people who really have affected me in my life other than my parents are my coaches.’”Quinn continued playing for B.U., but, after an injury-plagued junior season, he badly sprained his right ankle playing pickup basketball. The bruising turned into compartment syndrome, which required surgery. In his Rangers office recently, he rolled down a red-and-blue striped sock to expose a scar running down the outer half of his calf muscle to his ankle.He was in the hospital for five weeks and said he almost bled to death. His collegiate hockey career was over. Quinn remained at B.U. to finish his sociology degree and helped coach the school’s junior varsity hockey team.In 1991, the F.D.A. approved a drug trial to help hemophiliacs clot more quickly. By injecting himself before every practice and game, Quinn returned to the ice in what he refers to only as a “pseudo-comeback.” He had not skated in four years and had lost some mobility in his right foot.Quinn signed with the Rangers in 1992 and played a year and a half of minor league hockey. He had been a lock for the 1988 Olympic team but was a late cut from the ’92 squad. He tried out one final time for the 1994 roster, but was cut early.The night he was cut, Quinn was in his family’s home in Cranston, R.I., when his former B.U. assistant coach Ben Smith called. Smith had taken over as Northeastern head coach and offered Quinn an assistant job. He drove to Boston the next day.Quinn spent two nomadic decades in the coaching ranks. He was associate coach of B.U.’s 2009 N.C.A.A. championship team and was head coach of the 2015 squad that lost in the national title game. He was known for his recruiting panache.“I remember my mom couldn’t stop talking about him,” said Rangers defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, who was recruited to B.U. by Quinn. “He put the charm on my mom. I think, more than anything, he just had this presence to him.”Now, Quinn is charged with coaxing the most out of the Rangers’ young talent.“They’re a structured team,” said Florida Panthers associate coach Jack Capuano, a lifelong friend of Quinn’s. “They work hard. Obviously they’re buying into what he’s selling.”Quinn said the Rangers had “some good pieces here to build around,” citing the advances the Islanders and the Canadiens have made since last season.A talented new piece of the puzzle is likely on its way. The Rangers will participate in the N.H.L. draft lottery on Tuesday.Quinn, who lamented the lack of practice time in the N.H.L., called the challenge of rebuilding through development “very appealing.”“You really get a chance as the coach to be very involved in the process of the next great team here, hopefully,” he said."
"Why N.H.L. Player Duncan Keith Calls Himself a Biohacker - The New York Times
Duncan Keith, 35, is a three-time Stanley Cup champion and Conn Smythe Trophy winner, who recently played his 1,000th professional hockey game, all with the Chicago Blackhawks. A small-town guy at heart, he splits his time between Chicago and Penticton, British Columbia, where he grew up. He took a moment out of his punishing National Hockey League season (his 14th!) to share his workout and wellness secrets, and why he is obsessed with infrared therapy lights. I get up around 8 a.m. In the 45 minutes before I leave the house, I have a routine: I go upstairs to my lab, where I have a bunch of little things that I do to stay healthy. I try to get as much sunlight as possible, but I also have Joovv lights — they’re red and infrared lights, which are very healing. Then I lay on my Bemer mat, which has electromagnetic currents, for eight minutes. I also have my supplements like glutathione and vitamin C, and liquid herbs like ashwaganda. Sometimes at night, I’ll sleep with a hydrogen inhaler. I’m a biohacker and a part-time hockey player. It’s basically better living with the help of science.During the season, I don’t do a whole lot of heavy lifting. I use PoV Sport, a machine that uses electricity to keep your muscles contracted. It’s about feeling strong without me having to do any excess movement. The off-season is when I work out the hardest. I’m in the gym about five times a week doing strength training. It’s all based on the Evo Ultrafit system that my strength trainer Jay Schroeder does. He’s based out of Phoenix. He trains a lot of professional football players and baseball players. It’s a lot of body-weight stuff and isometrics and speed Russian lunges. I’ll start ice skating in July. By the end of the August, I’m skating four to five times a week.For me, the biggest thing for my skin care is the Joovv light. But then my buddy is a real skin fanatic with lots of different things. He told me about this skin care company called Eminence, and once in a while I’ll use the exfoliator in the steam shower.I don’t love the hotel skin care stuff. I bring my own. I use Ancient Minerals body lotion that has magnesium in it. I order it off Amazon. My skin gets nice and moisturized but also gets a dose of magnesium. I use the Ben Greenfield’s serum, which is a mix of vitamin C and a bunch of different herbs. And then I do use cologne. I use the Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Acqua the most.I wouldn’t say I’m on any specific diet. I’ve read Dr. Mercola’s books and I followed his nutrition plan for a while. But now, I just eat healthy and the biggest thing is getting a lot of calories in. I’m always burning calories during the season, and I’m trying to keep my mass on.I read a lot of books and I listen to podcasts. My favorite is the Ben Greenfield fitness podcast. I guess you could call him a professional biohacker. I also listen to Aubrey Marcus and Joe Rogan.Right now, I’m reading “Medical Medium” by Anthony William. It’s nonfiction and about food and nutrition. I enjoy reading and learning about the body. The first chapter is a little bit goofy, but essentially it’s about how important carbs and fruits are. It goes against a lot of things you hear today. I try to dress nice, but I’m not always thinking about it. I really like AllSaints jeans. I get most of my jeans from there. If not that, then I like Hudson jeans or Vince sweatpants. They’re like a classier pair of sweats. Lululemon is always comfortable.I’ve been on ice skates ever since I was maybe 3 or 4. I was always trying to be a hockey player. But to play professionally, you have to have the determination and focus. I remember there were high school parties that I didn’t go to because I was always working on my game. I missed a lot of those times. You have to set a goal and not let anything get in your way. This involves not only yourself, but also your family and parents. They are all part of it."
"Rangers Win as Alexandar Georgiev Shuts Out the Flyers - The New York Times
PHILADELPHIA — Alexandar Georgiev made 29 saves, and Ryan Strome scored in a third straight game, leading the Rangers past the Philadelphia Flyers, 3-0, on Sunday.Pavel Buchnevich and Brady Skjei also scored for the Rangers, who won consecutive games for the first time since mid-January, and Brett Howden had two assists.Strome scored late in the first period, giving the Rangers a 2-0 lead when he went top shelf on Flyers goalie Carter Hart, who had only one defenseman helping him defend against an odd-man rush.The goal was Strome’s 17th of the season for the Rangers and his 18th over all. He leads the N.H.L. in goals for his new team after being acquired from Edmonton in November.The second player on the list is Strome’s brother Dylan, who has 14 goals since being acquired by Chicago in a trade with Arizona in November.A third Strome brother, Matthew, 20, was assigned by the Flyers to their American Hockey League affiliate, Lehigh Valley, after his junior team, the Hamilton Bulldogs, was eliminated from the Ontario Hockey League playoffs.“Obviously, when you get rid of a lot of veteran guys, it’s tough,” Ryan Strome said of the rebuilding Rangers. “For our young group, the losing can wear on you a little bit.”He added: “Good to come in here and play a pretty solid road game. Good for the group to have a little more confidence moving forward.”The shutout was Georgiev’s second of the season, keeping the Flyers from winning all four games between the teams this season. The Flyers had not swept the season series against the Rangers since 1984-85. Going back to last season, the Flyers had taken six straight games against the Rangers.“I think I played a pretty good positional game,” Georgiev said. “I tried to be square to the puck and be patient on my feet.”Buchnevich opened the scoring with his 20th of the season at 16 minutes 25 seconds of the first period. Buchnevich collided with Flyers center Nolan Patrick early in the third when neither player saw the other coming. Buchnevich left the game and did not return. Rangers Coach David Quinn said Buchnevich should be fine for Monday’s game against the Devils at Prudential Center.Skjei scored his seventh of the season in the third period when his shot went off two Flyers and behind Hart, who finished with 22 saves.The Flyers had their best chance to score late in the second period, but James van Riemsdyk failed to convert on a breakaway."
"One Canceled Flight Upends the N.W.H.L. Playoffs - The New York Times
Last weekend, the Metropolitan Riveters nearly re-enacted “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” trying to reach their semifinal game of the National Women’s Hockey League playoffs.The Riveters dealt with predawn alarms; being momentarily stranded in Charlotte, N.C.; and losing most of their equipment. The game, against the Minnesota Whitecaps in St. Paul, scheduled for last Sunday, was postponed. The semifinal will now be played Friday night in St. Paul, with the Isobel Cup final scheduled for two days later at the same rink.The N.W.H.L., in its fourth season, has had travel-and weather-related postponements before, as have other professional leagues like the W.N.B.A. Despite partnerships with four N.H.L. franchises, N.W.H.L. teams still travel with budgetary and time constraints.Some Riveters players who expected to play last Sunday will not be available for the rescheduled game because they cannot take the day off from their full-time jobs.Kelsey Koelzer, a star on defense for the Riveters, is one of those casualties in the tough financial landscape still facing pro women’s hockey. This year, N.W.H.L. salaries range from $3,000 to $10,000.“It’s very frustrating,” Koelzer said after practice Tuesday night, beginning to choke up. “You work hard the whole season. You dedicate so much of your time. I’ve done my absolute best to get to every game possible. To reflect and think my season is potentially over and I didn’t even know that the last game I was going to play this season was my last game, it’s frustrating. It’s sad.”Other sacrifices were made for this unusual weekend of women’s hockey in Minnesota. The Buffalo Beauts, the No. 2 seed, gave up the right to possibly host the championship game against the Riveters. The Beauts were 8-0 at their home rink this season.Last Saturday, the majority of the Riveters were scheduled on a 2:53 p.m. flight to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport from La Guardia Airport. The team arrived at the airport two hours before takeoff, but because of wintry weather in the Midwest, the flight was canceled.Anya Battaglino, the director of the N.W.H.L. players’ association, then began working with the league on other options.An early Sunday morning flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Minneapolis, with a connection in Charlotte, was the most feasible option. Because of daylight saving time, players woke up around 1:30 a.m. to ensure no preboarding snafus. They boarded the plane just past 5 a.m., but it had to be de-iced. An hour later, the team still had not taken off, and began worrying about making its connection and reaching the arena for the opening face-off at 1:30 p.m. Central time.The Riveters landed in Charlotte around 8:02 a.m., missing their 7:40 a.m. connecting flight. About an hour later, the league announced the game was postponed.“We were all so delirious and hungry and tired, I think everybody was kind of relieved,” Riveters forward Miye D’Oench said. “Up until that moment, we were still sort of trying to stay in a game-day mind-set. It got harder to do as the day went on and more things went wrong.”The Riveters touched back down in Queens early Sunday afternoon, only to learn most of their equipment and personal bags were headed to Minnesota.That was not the only headache. Battaglino, the league office and players on the Riveters, the Whitecaps and the Beauts, who won their semifinal matchup against the Boston Pride on Saturday, had to figure out when and where to hold a makeup game.A Saturday semifinal and Sunday final was proposed, but some players worried about playing on consecutive days. In addition, the University of Minnesota’s women’s hockey team, a huge draw locally, has an N.C.A.A. tournament game against Princeton on Saturday. Travel for the Riveters and the Beauts also had to be considered.Eventually, a vote on Monday morning led to the Friday/Sunday setup. But that did not alleviate all concerns. While a majority of the Riveters were to fly out Thursday night (with no serious inclement weather in the forecast), Battaglino said seven players or staff members would travel separately from the team to better accommodate their schedules.Some members of the Riveters, the defending champions, see the travel problems as a possible advantage against the top-seeded Whitecaps.“Last weekend’s travel woes were very extreme, and I think it brought us closer as a team,” D’Oench said. “In a certain sense, sometimes going through a lot of adversity can sometimes play to a team’s advantage, and we’ve certainly had no shortage of adversity this season.”Battaglino said last weekend’s “fire drill” would be a learning experience and help influence future scheduling. The league openly discussed their decision-making process in a letter to fans.Koelzer said if the Riveters won Friday, she would look into getting to Minnesota for Sunday’s final. Now well-rested, many of the Riveters are confident they can defeat the Whitecaps, whom they were 0-4 against this season.But Kimberly Sass, a backup goaltender for the Riveters who documented last weekend’s travel woes on social media, is starting a new full-time job and cannot afford to take Friday off.On Tuesday, she wrote on Twitter that she hoped that in the future, “female professional athletes will never be faced with the decision to attend a game, or risk ruining a professional reputation at their non-sport place of employment.”"

"Angel, Buffy’s Favorite Brooder, Is Back in a New Comic Series - The New York Times
When new comic books arrive in stores on April 17, retailers who ordered the latest issue of a Buffy comic will get a bonus: free copies of Issue No. 0 of Angel, a new series.“We wanted to do something special with the launch of Angel,” Arune Singh, the vice president of marketing for Boom! Studios, the publisher, said in an interview. The notion, he noted, became, “How do we do a Beyoncé album drop, but for comic book stores?”Keeping Angel under wraps was no easy feat. Retailers and fans hear about new comics months in advance and sometimes even earlier. Boom! worked with Diamond Comic Distributors, the hub for retailers, on the top-secret project — playfully code-named Tooth Fairy, after the film starring Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. the Rock, as a hockey player. (Angel is a hockey fan.)Angel, a vampire with remorse, will expand the universe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which was rebooted in January. Like the new Buffy series, Angel will be set in contemporary times, not in 1999 when the character’s television series — a spinoff of the 1997 “Buffy” TV show — first aired.The Angel series is written by Bryan Edward Hill, drawn by Gleb Melnikov, colored by Gabriel Cassata and lettered by Ed Dukeshire. The first three pages of the issue present a different perspective on the final moments of Buffy No. 4, which arrives in stores the same day. In the Buffy comic, one of the characters is in a dire predicament, which is silently observed by Angel. In his comic, Angel sees the struggle, but readers are clued into his brooding on past sins and a cycle of violence. “I might be powerless to break it,” he thinks, “but who would I be if I didn’t try?”[Read about the new Buffy the Vampire Slayer comic that arrived in January.]In 2018, Boom! Studios announced it had acquired the rights to publish comics based on some of the creations of Joss Whedon, including the “Buffy” TV show as well as the 2002 “Firefly” series. But there was no mention of Angel, Buffy’s star-crossed love interest.The Buffy series has seen growing popularity — sales to stores have steadily increased from 25,000 copies for issue No. 2, in February, to 32,000 copies for issue No. 4 — and the company wanted to encourage more readers to discover her adventures by visiting a store.[Read about a publisher, TKO Studios, with a new binge-release model.]Last week, Bleeding Cool, a website devoted to pop culture, reported on the existence of Tooth Fairy No. 0 and began speculating about what the comic could be.This isn’t the first surprise comic. Robert Kirkman, the creator of The Walking Dead comic that spawned the television franchise, pulled off some magic last July. He sent retailers copies of his series Die!Die!Die!, which he wrote with Scott M. Gimple. It was drawn by Chris Burnham and colored by Nathan Fairbairn.“Hopefully the excitement of a surprise launch like this will bring people into your stores,” Kirkman wrote in a letter to the shops, “and we can all celebrate another successful series launch together.”Boom! is giving retailers around the country some of the 29,000 copies of Angel No. 0, which has a cover price of $3.99, based on the number of copies of Buffy No. 3 (from March) that they ordered. Additionally, Angel No. 0 will not be available for download until May 1, making the need to visit a comic store more immediate.“We want these comic shop retailers, who are the lifeblood of this industry, to know we are committed to them,” Singh said."
"In the N.H.L., Finland Is Now Here, There and Everywhere - The New York Times
When the Winnipeg Jets play host to the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday night, the meeting will be more than a showcase of the Central Division leader against the league’s top-scoring line. It will be a glimpse of a decade-long transformation of Finnish hockey.Patrik Laine of Winnipeg, 20, and Mikko Rantanen of Colorado, 22, have spent much of their young N.H.L. careers among the league leaders in scoring, gaining a spotlight for a golden generation from Finland, one of the smallest, and most successful, hockey-playing nations.“That age group in Finland, there must be something in the water or they’re feeding them the right things up there,” said the Winnipeg captain, Blake Wheeler.Seven players from Finland, a country of 5.5 million, have been top 10 draft picks since 2013, and nearly all of them are playing significant roles on their N.H.L. teams.Laine, the No. 2 pick in 2016, almost immediately became the most recognizable face in Finnish hockey since Teemu Selanne. Despite some lean scoring stretches this season, Laine has been one of the league’s best goal-scorers over the past three seasons. In November, he scored five goals on five shots in a game against the St. Louis Blues, and he became the fourth-youngest player to reach 100 career goals.The highlight of that month for Laine was the N.H.L’s return to Finland, where he notched a hat trick and then another goal in a pair of games in Helsinki against a fellow Finn, Aleksander Barkov, and the rest of the Florida Panthers.“His shooting is a work of art,” said Sami Salo, a former N.H.L. defenseman who now coaches in Finland. “It doesn’t matter if the puck comes at a bad angle, he always seem to get a perfect shot any time.”Rantanen, the No. 10 pick in 2015, has transformed himself into one of the league’s savviest and most imaginative playmakers. With 75 points, Rantanen is fourth in the N.H.L. in scoring and has combined with Nathan MacKinnon and Gabriel Landeskog to compile 206 points, tied with Calgary’s top line for the most of any trio.“He can find the passing lane even though there’s five sticks in the way,” Laine said of Rantanen, with whom he has trained for the past three summers. “He’s going to find a way. He’s also one of the strongest players that age that I’ve ever seen.”Two Finnish players, Selanne and Jari Kurri, have led the N.H.L. in goals during a regular season, and both are in the Hall of Fame. But behind Selanne and Kurri in career points per game by Finnish players are four active members of the N.H.L., all of them under 25. They are Laine, Rantanen, Barkov and Sebastian Aho of the Carolina Hurricanes.Young Finnish defensemen are also making a mark. Dallas Stars defenseman Miro Heiskanen, the No. 3 pick in the 2017 draft, dominated in Finland as a teenager and was an All-Star last month in his first N.H.L. season. He has followed a path similar to that of Buffalo Sabres defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen, selected eighth in 2013.Finland’s rise is evident in international play, too. In January, the Finns earned the gold medal at the world junior championship for the third time in six years, after winning it only twice in the 40 years before this run.“If you win three times in six years, that tells you something,” said Rantanen, who played on the 2016 junior champions with Laine, Aho and Toronto Maple Leafs winger Kasperi Kapanen. “It’s not only luck or just one good tournament. In Finnish coaching, the level is going higher and higher. There are a lot of good, young coaches coming, and I think the biggest thing is that the coaches are trying to concentrate on individuals more than five or 10 years ago.”Neither the national team’s success nor its players’ prolific totals in the N.H.L. are coincidental. Beginning in 2009, Finnish officials made considerable investments and sweeping changes that gave greater continuity to player development. In 2014, after a disastrous under-18 world championship tournament that included a 10-0 loss to its archrival Sweden, the Finnish federation held a wide-ranging summit that emphasized individual skills like skating, puck-handling, shooting, balance and strength training.“They teach us a lot about playing together, but when we’re playing together, we need all players to have good individual skills, especially skating,” said Barkov, 23, an elite two-way player who averages a point per game. “Hockey is getting a lot faster and more skilled.”Kurri, a former general manager of the national program, described the old model for success.“If we didn’t have the most skilled players, we had to be a good as a team,” he said. “That’s how we could have success, for many many years. That and good goaltending, we always had a good goalie behind us.”Finland did produce a generation of outstanding goalies, including winners of the Stanley Cup and the Vezina Trophy like Miikka Kiprusoff, Antti Niemi and Tuukka Rask. But now netminders have taken a back seat to skaters.Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne, 36, said that the emphasis on individual skills and the provocation of players’ imaginations through exposure to the N.H.L. has produced the most abundant and diverse crop of Finns ever to emerge in pro hockey.“The Finnish player type used to be the very reliable, solid, two-way player who had a very successful career, maybe on lower lines,” said Rinne, who won the Vezina Trophy last season. “Now we have these individuals coming up with amazing skill, and I feel like there’s something to that exposure and kids being able to see, copy and try on their own.”The mind-set is changing for defensemen, too, as Heiskanen and Ristolainen have not only logged big minutes but have also played with flair.“Defensemen were kind of the players nobody wanted to be because you had to defend,” Salo said. “You can’t score really, you have to stay back. I see a big change in the mind of youngsters who are coming up. They are fearless with the puck; they want to score all the time.”Jere Lehtinen, a former Dallas Stars right wing and the general manager of Finland’s national team, said that each win, each medal and each successful Finnish N.H.L. player reinforces belief and raises expectations for successive generations. His generation, which won medals at the Olympics and world championships, instilled confidence that games were winnable regardless of opponent, circumstance or score.“Nowadays these guys, these kids coming in, they just come and they know they can win,” Lehtinen said. “They don’t hesitate at all, they’re not scared of losing.”The Finnish pipeline shows no signs of drying up. Right wing Kaapo Kakko is expected to be a top 5 pick in the coming draft in June.“It has taken a long, long time until the next wave of really good Finnish players,” Rinne said. “Now we are there, and I feel like every year there are new guys popping up. I’m very excited to watch those guys.”"
"Sorry, Canada: Parity Reshapes the World Junior Championship - The New York Times
VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Canada can deliver the crowds, but the rest of the hockey world is catching up when it comes to delivering on-ice results at the World Junior Championship, the top international under-20 men’s hockey tournament.On Saturday, Finland earned its third gold medal in the last six years in the event, beating the United States, 3-2, in the championship game.Saturday’s matchup was the first gold medal game between Finland and the United States at the World Junior Championship, but those teams have regularly been on the podium in recent years in an event once dominated by Canada.Since 1977, Canada has won 17 gold medals, including two runs of five straight titles: from 1993 to 1997, and again from 2005 to 2009.But this year’s tournament now will live in infamy — at least in Canada — as the first time the Canadians failed to earn a medal when serving as the tournament’s host. Finland eliminated Canada, 2-1 in overtime, in the quarterfinals. Canada has won the event only twice in the last 10 years, while Finland and the United States have each brought home three golds.The United States is the only country to have reached the podium in each of the last four years (gold in 2017, silver in 2019 and bronze in 2016 and 2018). The Americans’ seven podium appearances in the last 10 years (three gold, one silver, three bronze) are second only to Russia’s eight (one gold, three silver, four bronze).Finland’s gold was its fifth in tournament history and the federation’s first victory in North America, where games are played on a smaller ice surface than they are in Europe.“You’re starting to see some teams get into this portion of the tournament regularly,” United States Coach Mike Hastings said. “I think that says a lot about all the programs that we’re talking about — all the countries. This is a very difficult tournament. Seeing who was here at the end — it’s hard to get here. For the countries that are doing it on a consistent basis, I think that says something about where they’re at.”Dave Starman, an analyst for the tournament for NHL Network, is also a member of the coaching education program with USA Hockey. He said the recent success of American teams could be attributed in large part to a new development model that was introduced 10 years ago.“We have absolutely reshaped how we’re teaching the game and how we’re teaching coaches how to teach the game,” Starman said. “We have really emphasized small-area games, and it goes along with age-appropriate practices.“If we play a lot more 3-on-3, 2-on-2, where younger kids are touching the puck more, they’re in an environment where they’re going to have more fun and be more involved,” he added. “Not only are they going to have more fun and want to come back, they’re going to get better because they’re constantly involved in the play.”The emphasis is the same in Finland, Starman said.“A lot of their parents and their organizations don’t care who wins the average game by shortening a bench so they can win a game,” he said. “Their players play, and they use their bench. They believe in player development.”The trends from the World Junior Championship are now showing up in the N.H.L., too. Over the last decade, the American and Finnish federations have increased the number of players they have delivered to the N.H.L.In 2009-10, the season that John Carlson’s overtime goal in Saskatoon gave the United States a 6-5 win over Canada in the final, 22 percent of N.H.L. players (212) hailed from the United States, while 4 percent (38) came from Finland, according to Quant Hockey.This season, the N.H.L. is up to 240 American players (26.8 percent) and 49 Finns (5.5 percent). With Finland’s Mikko Rantanen and the Americans Johnny Gaudreau and Patrick Kane among the league’s top scorers, it is not surprising to see that the number of points produced by players from the two nations also has increased — to 26.2 percent from 19.4 in 2009-10 for Americans and to 5.7 percent from 3.8 for Finns.Jack Hughes, 17, a forward on this year’s American team, is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the N.H.L. draft in June. Kaapo Kakko, 17, who scored the gold medal-winning goal with 1 minute 26 seconds left Saturday, and his teammate Anttoni Honka will be looking to follow in the footsteps of Patrik Laine of the Winnipeg Jets, Jesse Puljujarvi of the Edmonton Oilers and Olli Juolevi of the Vancouver Canucks from Finland’s gold-winning team in 2016; all were selected in the top five at that year’s N.H.L. draft. (A Canadian player has not been chosen No. 1 over all since Connor McDavid in 2015.)Hockey Canada’s chief executive, Tom Renney, said he recognized the value of increased parity.“I think if we want this game to be global, we have to recognize it has arrived — that other federations can compete and compete very well,” he said. “I think it’s healthy.”He added: “You can look at any number of games that we’ve had up to this point in time and recognize that it’s millimeters or milliseconds that can change the outcome of the game. That is certainly fan-friendly, and in my mind, it encourages children to play.”"
"As Huawei’s Influence in Canada Grows, Some Fear Spying. Others Just Want Fast Internet. - The New York Times
MONTREAL — In recent weeks, some viewers of “Hockey Night in Canada” have been jolted by the sight of a distinctive red chrysanthemum logo conspicuously displayed during the broadcast of a sports program as quintessentially Canadian as the national game itself.It is the logo for Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant whose chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is out on bail in Vancouver, with a GPS tracking device around her ankle, as she awaits possible extradition to the United States to face fraud charges.Advertising on “Hockey Night” is just one example of the expanding footprint of Huawei in Canada, where it has invested a total of $500 million in research and development, including into 5G technology at leading Canadian universities.It also has research facilities in Ottawa, Waterloo, Montreal, and Vancouver; is providing high-speed internet to remote areas of the country; and employs about 1,100 people in Canada.Now, the company finds itself at the center of a rift in Chinese-Canadian relations caused by Ms. Meng’s case, which includes charges of evading United States economic sanctions on Iran. Following her arrest, China detained several Canadians and sentenced a Canadian drug smuggler to death, in what many here viewed as retaliation. If Canada decides to extradite her, which legal experts say is likely, there are concerns of significant reprisals.Even before Ms. Meng’s arrest, which has incensed China, some experts were warning that Huawei’s growing presence in Canada could undermine the country’s economic interests and security.Her case has only intensified those worries.Canadians should take notice that “a company that is invested hugely in Canada is facing serious allegations of fraud,” said David Mulroney, Canada’s ambassador to China from 2009 to 2012.He noted that Huawei had been adept in its approach to the Canadian market, using savvy marketing techniques.“The message that Huawei is on your side in hockey is very shrewd,” Mr. Mulroney said, referring to the “Hockey Night” sponsorship. “Hockey is as close to the Canadian psyche as you can get.”Huawei’s attempt to woo Canadians comes as Canada’s security agencies are undertaking a national security review of whether Huawei technology should be allowed in Canada’s nascent 5G telecommunications network. That review will determine if Canada will accede to pressure from the United States to ban Huawei products from its 5G wireless networks amid concerns they could be used by the Chinese government for espionage.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]Australia and New Zealand have already followed the United States by blocking Huawei from supplying technology for 5G infrastructure.Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for the Canadian public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, declined to comment specifically on Huawei, but said the government was carefully assessing the security challenges and potential threats of 5G technology.“We will ensure that our networks are kept safe for Canadians,” he said.Some experts argue against what they say is American demonizing of Huawei and say the Chinese company owes its success in Canada to making reasonably priced, good quality products consumers like to buy.But former government officials have expressed concern.Richard Fadden, a former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who also was a national security adviser to two prime ministers, said Huawei represented a clear cybersecurity threat to Canada since Chinese companies like Huawei were required, by law, to respond to directions from the Chinese state, which collects intellectual property and intelligence from Western countries, including Canada.“I would counsel the government to forbid the use of Huawei equipment in the development of our 5G network,” Mr. Fadden wrote in an email.He added that any controls or firewalls that worked today would eventually be overcome by China’s “very sophisticated and ingenious security agencies.”At a news conference last week in Toronto, Huawei’s chairman, Liang Hua, insisted the company posed no threat. “On issues of cybersecurity, Huawei would never do anything to harm any country, any organization or any individual,” Mr. Liang said.He said there was no law in China requiring companies “to install back doors or collect foreign intelligence.”He added that if Huawei ever received such a request from the Chinese state, it would not execute it because the law does not require it to do so.Sitting in front of a sign with the words “10 Years” — representing Huawei’s decade of doing business in Canada — superimposed on a red Canadian maple leaf, Mr. Liang expressed Huawei’s continued commitment to Canada and praised the country as “an open and inclusive place.”He also commented on Ms. Meng’s case.“I hope that the Canadian legal system could bring justice back to her,” he said, adding that the American pressure on its allies over Huawei had provided “a free round of advertisement for the company.”Perhaps nowhere has Huawei’s influence in Canada been more present than in research and development, including at leading Canadian academic institutions, where it has made big investments in research.These investments have generated alarm that, in return for money, cash-strapped Canadian universities are relinquishing control to Huawei of intellectual property related to 5G, while making themselves vulnerable to infiltration by China’s security apparatus.Christian Chua, president of research at Huawei Canada, told reporters last week at the news conference that Huawei shared its intellectual property with the Canadian universities with which it partnered.Wesley Wark, an intelligence expert at the University of Ottawa, noted that universities were typically not vigilant when it came to security issues.He added, however, that the current “scaremongering” about Huawei was misplaced given that both China and Huawei had too much to lose if they spied on the West and lost access to those markets.Nevertheless, concerns that Huawei’s products and infrastructure, including smartphones or cellular base stations, could be used by Chinese intelligence services have been swirling on some Canadian college campuses, including McGill University in Montreal.In December, Canadian Security Intelligence Service officials briefed about 15 researchers there who receive funding from Huawei about national security risks.According to Vincent Allaire, a spokesman for McGill, the spy agency warned the researchers, among other things, that the technology they were working on in partnership with Huawei included “dual-use technology” that could potentially be used for military purposes.Officials at other universities disputed there were any major risks involved in the research partnerships.John-Paul Heale, who oversees company-sponsored research at the University of British Columbia, said Huawei had contributed about $8 million for 14 research projects over three years.He stressed that the university could not become an outpost for secret research on behalf of the Chinese state because all research was required to be published in peer-reviewed journals.“Our research is not happening in the shadows,” he said.While Huawei’s business has been curtailed in the United States amid spying fears, the company is banking on the fact that in Canada, the desire for reasonably priced smartphones and high-speed internet is what ultimately matters to consumers.That appears to be the case in Lac La Hache, British Columbia, population 258, a rural community about 300 miles from Vancouver, where Huawei has partnered with the internet provider ABC Communications to provide high-speed internet.Robert Fry, owner of Cariboo Radio station, said he currently has to commute 45 minutes each day to another town that has an internet connection fast enough to operate a web-based radio station.Thanks to Huawei technology, he said he hopes to be able to work locally and save $20,000 a year.“There are fears that China is corrupt and watching what we do and some people are scared they could spy on us,” he said. “But I’m not worried about that. What matters to me is getting high-speed internet.”"
"Washington’s Most Popular Russian (and His Teammates) Honored at White House - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump reveled in the apparent fizzling of a two-year effort to prosecute him for possible illicit coordination with Russia during the 2016 campaign, Washington’s most prominent Moscow native arrived at the White House on Monday to celebrate.The milestone? A hockey championship.Some members of the Washington Capitals, who won their first Stanley Cup title in June, boycotted the White House event in their honor, which included a private tour and a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. But not Alex Ovechkin, the team’s Russian captain and the National Hockey League’s most valuable player, who is also a vocal admirer and personal friend of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Mr. Ovechkin was not the only Russian player in the Oval Office on Monday. He was joined there by two teammates: Evgeny Kuznetsov, a forward, and Dmitry Orlov, a defenseman, who were part of a 55-member Capitals delegation, the first from a Washington team to visit the White House since the Washington Redskins won the Super Bowl in 1992.“You’re champions,” Mr. Trump told them, after reading out Mr. Ovechkin’s statistics for the season “You have a champion’s heart.”Braden Holtby, the Capitals goalie and an outspoken gay rights advocate, declined to visit the White House. “I’ve got to stay true to my values, and I’m going to respectfully decline,” Mr. Holtby told reporters last week. Two other members of the championship team, Brett Connolly and Devante Smith-Pelly, also said they would not attend.The irony of the photo-op, in which Mr. Ovechkin stood smiling behind the Resolute Desk next to Mr. Trump, wearing a red tie that matched the president’s signature look, wasn’t lost on some former White House officials.“Perhaps the only time Russians have visited the Trump White House with bipartisan support in D.C.,” said Andy Hemming, a former White House staff member.Another former aide pointed out that the White House was a natural place for the Stanley Cup to visit, after Mr. Ovechkin took the trophy on a tour of Moscow’s Red Square last summer.Mr. Ovechkin has said he is an apolitical sports star. But questions about his connections to Mr. Putin, and whether he is a participant, knowingly or unknowingly, in a Kremlin propaganda machine, have swirled around his career. They peaked when Mr. Ovechkin announced last year the creation of a “civic movement” that he branded online as #putinteam, ahead of Russia’s elections.Mr. Ovechkin, who received a wedding gift from Mr. Putin and reportedly has his personal phone number, insisted that the hashtag and the campaign were simply his own project, involving no input or signoff from Mr. Putin’s government. There were questions, however, about whether a public relations firm with Kremlin connections was involved.The three Russians on the Capitals have said their concern is providing entertainment and escape, not influencing global leaders. “A real sport, like art, always brings people together,” Mr. Kuznetsov said in a recent interview with the Russian news media. “And the better we play, the more people will get away from political and other news.”But the optics of Monday afternoon’s event recalled another Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump took with Russians, in May 2017. At that meeting Mr. Trump told Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, and Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, that firing the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, took “great pressure” off him.That conversation reinforced the belief that Mr. Trump had fired Mr. Comey because of the F.B.I.’s investigation into possible collusion between Russian operatives and the campaign — a move that would have potentially implicated him in another crime, obstruction of justice.But as the Capitals players balanced the Stanley Cup on the Resolute Desk, another “great pressure” seemed to have been relieved. On Friday, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, concluded his two-year investigation, and in a four-page letter to congressional leaders released on Sunday night, William P. Barr, the attorney general, said the investigation had ended without finding any collusion with the Russians.Mr. Ovechkin thanked the president for hosting his team and promised to try to win the Stanley Cup again this season."
"Maple Leafs Recall G Hutchinson With Sparks Struggling - The New York Times
The Toronto Maple Leafs recalled goaltender Michael Hutchinson from the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL) on Friday.Frederik Andersen's backup, Garret Sparks, has lost nine of his past 11 decisions and has never played in an NHL playoff game.Hutchinson was acquired from the Florida Panthers on Dec. 29 and posted a 2-3-0 record with a 2.64 goals against average and a .914 save percentage in five appearances with the Maple Leafs when Andersen was sidelined by a groin injury. He has registered a 14-5-3 record with a 2.70 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage in 23 games with the Marlies.Hutchinson owns a 46-43-13 record with a 2.70 goals-against average, a .908 save percentage and four shutouts in 111 career NHL games.

"Ira Gitler, Influential Jazz Critic and Historian, Dies at 90 - The New York Times
Ira Gitler, who was one of the most respected and prolific jazz writers of the postwar era and an early champion of bebop, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 90.His son, Fitz, confirmed the death, at a nursing facility.Mr. Gitler’s criticism appeared regularly in publications like DownBeat and JazzTimes. He wrote two books about bebop, the challenging form of modern jazz that emerged in the 1940s. And, along with Leonard Feather and Nat Hentoff, he was among the most prodigious writers of liner notes, annotating more than 700 albums.In 2017 he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.“He had a terrific ear, and could not be fooled by reputation, no matter how,” the jazz writer Gary Giddins said in an email. “Musicians respected him; they considered him one of the tribe. You can’t say that about a lot of critics.”Mr. Gitler’s immersion in modern jazz led him to a job with the jazz label Prestige Records in 1950. He packed and unpacked 78s, did promotional work and swept the floors. More important, he wrote his first liner notes, in 1951, for “Swingin’ With Zoot Sims,” and later that year produced his first recording session, for the saxophonist Sonny Rollins.In 1953, he produced a memorable session with Miles Davis on trumpet and Charlie Parker and Mr. Rollins on saxophones. It was, he recalled, a difficult afternoon: Davis was late and, while the group waited, Parker drank nearly a bottle of gin in two large gulps and dozed off. After Davis’s arrival, Mr. Gitler told him, in profane terms, that he was not playing well.“Maybe he wanted to leave — I think he was bluffing — but he started packing up his horn,” Mr. Gitler said in a 2009 video interview with the filmmaker Bret Primack. “I said I didn’t mean anything, that I was trying to get him going.”Davis stayed, and the session proceeded. They recorded three songs, finishing with the Thelonious Monk ballad  “ ’Round Midnight,” which Mr. Gitler felt would be less taxing on Davis.“It turned out to be kind of somber,” Mr. Gitler said. “It had the feeling of that day, and to me it was a masterpiece.” The tune became a staple of Davis’s repertoire.Mr. Gitler, an amateur saxophonist, called Prestige his finishing school, and his experience there informed the rest of his career. His knowledge of jazz — acquired by going to nightclubs, attending recording sessions and hanging out with musicians — made him an erudite figure in the field. He was an early supporter of musicians like the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon, who spent many years in Europe and out of the American limelight before experiencing a career resurgence in the 1970s.Mr. Gitler was born on Dec. 18, 1928, in Brooklyn to parents who had immigrated from Russia. His father, Samuel, was a furrier, and his mother, Frances (Goldberg) Gitler, was a homemaker.At age 5, Ira started taking piano lessons; soon after, he was introduced to swing music by his brother, Monroe, who was 12 years older. Together they listened to big bands on the radio and to records by Count Basie and Benny Goodman. In 1940, Ira tagged along with his brother and a date to see Jimmie Lunceford and his band at the Strand Theater in Brooklyn.As a teenager, he traveled to nightclubs in Manhattan and first heard bebop live. Writing in 1946 for the Columbia Grammar School newspaper, he reviewed the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie’s electric performance at the Spotlite Club on West 52nd Street. He later recalled their brief first meeting.“When Dizzy passed my table after his set,” he wrote, “I greeted him familiarly (even though I had never been in his presence) and asked him when he was going to record again. ‘We recorded today,’ he answered with a twinkle in his high-pitched, slightly sandpapery voice.”While attending the University of Missouri, Mr. Gitler spent time in jazz clubs in St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., and Chicago and, during summer vacations, on 52nd Street and in Harlem. He dropped out of college before graduating and joined Prestige.In the mid-1950s he left the label to pursue freelance writing — the only jobs he held after that were two stints as an editor at DownBeat, between 1963 and 1970 — and quickly distinguished himself. In his notes for John Coltrane’s album “Soultrane” (1958), Mr. Gitler coined the enduring phrase “sheets of sound” to describe that saxophonist’s intense arpeggio runs.“The image I had in my head,” Mr. Gitler told the website All About Jazz in 2009, “were bolts of cloth undulating as they unfurled. Coltrane never said anything about the term. He never referred to it when I saw him, and I didn’t ask him about it.”Mr. Giddins said that Mr. Gitler’s liner notes had helped cement his reputation. “Those notes are as much a part of those albums as the sequencing of tracks and the cover art,” he said.Mr. Gitler had a close association with Mr. Feather, the longtime jazz critic for The Los Angeles Times. He was an assistant on Mr. Feather’s “The New Encyclopedia of Jazz” (1960), and he completed “The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz” (1999) after Mr. Feather’s death in 1994 and was credited as co-author.On his own, Mr. Gitler wrote “Jazz Masters of the 40s” (1966) and “Swing to Bop: An Oral History of the Transition in Jazz in the 1940s” (1985).As passionate as Mr. Gitler was about jazz, he was equally passionate about another pursuit: ice hockey. He played for and coached an amateur-league team, Gitler’s Gorillas, and wrote “Blood on the Ice: Hockey’s Most Violent Moments” (1974). He also wrote for the program sold to fans at Ranger games at Madison Square Garden.Stan Fischler, a longtime hockey writer and commentator and a friend of Mr. Gitler’s, recalled on Twitter that a high point of Mr. Gitler’s avocation was playing defense on a fantasy hockey team in 1984 in Lake Placid, N.Y., with the Hall of Famers Gordie Howe and Bill Gadsby.Mr. Fischler wrote that Gadsby, also a defenseman, was worried that Mr. Gitler would not be able to help hold their team’s one-goal lead when he skated onto the ice in the final minute of the game. “As Bill skated past Ira,” he wrote, “Gadsby stopped, leaned over and uttered the deathless words: ‘Ira, just get in the way!’ ” The lead held.In addition to his son, Mr. Gitler is survived by his wife, Mary Jo (Schwalbach) Gitler, an artist, and two grandchildren.For all the musicians Mr. Gitler wrote about, Parker and Gillespie made the strongest impressions on him.“He said that Bird was one half of his heart,” Fitz Gitler said in an interview, “and Dizzy was the other half.”"

"The Flyers’ Goalie-Go-Round May Have Discovered a Star - The New York Times
VOORHEES, N.J. — There they were, four pairs of goaltender pads propped up in front of a row of stalls in the Philadelphia Flyers’ locker room last week, a testament to one of the more intriguing story lines on the team.“The good news is that none of them are mine,” said Scott Gordon, the Flyers’ interim coach and a goaltender for the Quebec Nordiques for 23 games in the early 1990s.Because of injuries, the Flyers have gone through seven goalies this season, tying an N.H.L. record that is shared by three other teams, Gordon’s 1989-90 Nordiques among them. That explains all the pads — with two goalies now suiting up for games and two others still rehabilitating and getting closer to a return.The upside of all this upheaval is that the Flyers, for now, are thriving because they had to turn to their top goaltending prospect — 20-year-old Carter Hart — for help.Hart, a second-round draft choice in 2016, began this season playing for the Flyers’ top farm team, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, and the plan was to keep him there, with Gordon as his head coach.Plans change. Now both of them are with the Flyers, promoted at the same time when Coach Dave Hakstol was fired in December.Hart won his first two games to extend what had been regarded as a tryout, then later reeled off eight straight victories — tying an N.H.L. record for a goalie under 21 — before the Flyers lost Monday to Pittsburgh, 4-1, with him in the net.“He’s handled all of the situations that have been presented to him in an exceptional manner,” said Gordon, who previously coached the Islanders from 2008 to 2010. “We’re seeing a lot of maturity that you’re not usually seeing in a 20-year-old.”Because he has two goaltenders — Brian Elliott and Michal Neuvirth — who are working their way back to full health, Gordon does not want to say if Hart will stay with the team for the remainder of the season. Four healthy goalies are, well, a lot of goalies. But Hart said he was planning to move into the old apartment of his Flyers teammate Jake Voracek. Maybe that’s a sign that he’s not going anywhere.“The guys have really welcomed me here,’’ Hart said recently, while standing in a quiet corner of the dressing room. “They’ve been really great to me.’’A native of Sherwood Park, Alberta, Hart said he had become quite aware since he was drafted that taking on the role as the Flyers’ goaltender of the future meant dealing with the demanding standards of Philadelphia’s fans.The Flyers have not won the Stanley Cup since 1975, when goalie Bernie Parent helped lead the team known as the Broad Street Bullies to their second straight title. The Flyers have lost in the Stanley Cup finals six times since then, most recently in 2010.Before they drafted Hart, the Flyers selected five goaltenders in the first or second round since that 1975 Stanley Cup triumph. One of them, Anthony Stolarz, is now a backup. Another, Brian Boucher, the team’s No. 1 pick in 1995, did go on to win 21 playoff games for the Flyers. But not the Stanley Cup.“It’s difficult. There’s pressure,” said Boucher, now 42 and a hockey analyst for the Flyers, NBC Sports and the NHL Network. “The bar was set high by Bernie Parent in the ‘70s, and the fans are longing for those glory days to come back.’’Parent retired early, at the age of 34, after sustaining a career-ending eye injury in February 1979. That same year, the Flyers drafted another goalie, Pelle Lindbergh, in the second round and he led the Flyers to the Stanley Cup finals in 1985. But later that year, he was fatally injured in an automobile crash; he had been to a team party and was intoxicated when the accident occurred.Ron Hextall became the next standout Flyers goalie and was part of Philadelphia teams that went to the Cup finals in 1987 and 1997, again without winning a championship. He became the Flyers’ general manager in 2014 but was dismissed last November.Now Hart has moved into the crease and quickly distinguished himself.“So far, he’s done a nice job of handling it,’’ Boucher said. “Still a small window, but he’s done a really nice job.”The decision to call up Hart and, at the same time, install Gordon as the interim coach, was made by Chuck Fletcher, who took over as the Flyers’ general manager when Hextall was let go. He called the pair of moves “a coincidence.”Although there was concern that Hart would be joining a floundering team and might struggle at the outset, the decision to promote him now looks like a masterstroke.Hart has been so steady and unflappable — even as opponents have taken early leads in games — that the Flyers have actually crept into the race for a playoff spot. With a 26-24-7 record, including a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday in Stolarz in goal, the Flyers were just 8 points from a wild-card berth entering Thursday’s games.“He’s going to only continue to get better,” Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov, who is all of 22, said of Hart. “It’s impressive. He plays with a lot of confidence as a young goaltender. You don’t see that often.”Hart, who had played junior hockey for the Everett Silvertips in the Western Hockey League for the past four seasons, won his N.H.L. debut on Dec. 19 at home against Detroit, 3-2. He stopped 31 of 32 shots in a victory over Nashville two nights later. The Flyers, adjusting to Gordon, lost seven of the next eight games that Hart started, but his new teammates spotted a trait.“It’s his maturity — the way he acts around us and on the ice,” Flyers center Sean Couturier said. “He’s way above his years.”Elliott, 33, and Neuvirth, 30, are hoping to return soon from lower-body injuries. Elliott, out since November, resumed on-ice workouts last month.His assessment of Hart? “He just stays within himself, and the more patient you are in letting pucks come to you, the better,’’ Elliott said. “It’s like swinging a golf club. You swing too hard, you’ll slice it.”Elliott suggested that Hart might have benefited from being called up in the middle of the season, when the Flyers were struggling. Perhaps the challenge would have been more difficult had Hart been made the No. 1 goalie entering a season.Hart shrugged when asked about that notion. “Honestly, when I came up here, there was a lot of stuff going on from a management standpoint, but as one of the players, you just have to go out and do your job,’’ he said.It’s a job that, for now at least, he is doing astoundingly well."

"Tallon Hires Quenneville to Coach Panthers - The New York Times
One day after firing head coach Bob Boughner, the Florida Panthers have hired Joel Quenneville as his successor.Quenneville, who was fired by the Chicago Blackhawks in November, is receiving a multi-year contract worth more than $6 million a year with bonuses, according to ESPN. The Panthers announced his hiring Monday.""Fate is a wonderful thing in my life,"" said Panthers general manager Dale Tallon, who hired Quenneville in Chicago but was fired by the Blackhawks a year later.""It's like a blessing for me. This is a blessing. There are a lot of coaching jobs available. We wanted to get it done because he's a popular guy and a lot of teams out there would love to have him as their coach.""The Blackhawks won three Stanley Cups during Quenneville's tenure that began in 2008, and they missed the playoffs just once. He left with a record of 452-249-96 in 797 games.Quenneville, 60, also coached a combined 11 seasons in Colorado and St. Louis and has an overall career record of 890-532-77-137. He won the Jack Adams Award in 1999-2000 as the NHL coach adjudged to have contributed the most to his team's success, and his 890 regular-season wins as an NHL head coach are the second most in NHL history.""Joel is a three-time Stanley Cup champion head coach who will be a transformative leader for the Florida Panthers franchise,"" said Tallon. ""We've seized the opportunity to add one of the most successful head coaches in hockey history and we're thrilled that Joel has agreed to take on the challenge of leading our promising young team.""I've worked with Joel previously and have seen firsthand how his passion for the game, head coaching experience and leadership can impact an organization.

"Harry Howell, Star Defenseman With Rangers for 17 Years, Dies at 86 - The New York Times
Harry Howell, the Hall of Fame defenseman who became one of hockey’s most durable figures, playing with the Rangers for 17 seasons in a career that spanned 24 seasons in two leagues, died on Saturday in Ontario. He was 86.His death was confirmed by the Rangers.He had dementia and was living at a long-term care facility in Ancaster, outside his hometown, Hamilton.When Howell joined the Rangers in October 1952, he was among 14 rookies with the team that season. Most didn’t stick around too long, but Howell went on to play in 1,160 regular-season games as a Ranger, a still-standing team record.The Rangers were often lackluster in Howell’s playing days, but he joined with Andy Bathgate on right wing and Gump Worsley in goal, his fellow rookies and future Hall of Famers as well, to give their frustrated fans of the 1950s and early ’60s some hope.Howell won the Norris Trophy as the N.H.L.’s leading defenseman in the 1966-67 season and he was a seven-time All-Star.Soon after playing in his 1,000th game, in January 1967, he was presented with the Medal of the City of New York by Mayor John V. Lindsay and he was honored at the old Madison Square Garden with the first “night” ever accorded a Rangers player.Making his Ranger debut on Oct. 18, 1952, facing the Maple Leafs in Toronto, Howell scored on his first shot. But he was known as a “stay at home” defenseman, usually sticking close to his blue line instead of looking for a chance to carry the puck up ice.At 6 foot 1 and 195 pounds or so, “I was a big guy for the time I played,” he told John Halligan and John Kreiser in “Game of My Life: New York Rangers” (2008). “But I wasn’t the type of guy to go run people. I could take them out of the play but I wasn’t going to skate 50 feet to hit someone.”Howell finally broke the double-digit mark in goals scored in the 1966-67 season, when he had 12 goals and 28 assists.“We had Boom-Boom Geoffrion,” he once told the Hall of Fame in recalling that season. “He came to us from the Montreal Canadiens as a power-play specialist. I’d pass him the puck on the right point. He’d pass it back to me. I’d pass to him. Finally, he said, ‘Will you please shoot the puck?’ A few of them went in.”But for much of the city, the Rangers were often an afterthought, since they were regularly displaced from the Eighth Avenue Garden by more lucrative events.“The first two weeks of the season, the rodeo was booked in,” Howell told the Hall, which inducted him in 1979. “The Kennel Club had dogs come in in February. And then the circus came in right at the end of the season, and if we made the playoffs you’d be lucky to play two games at home, and the rest would be on the road.”Henry Vernon Howell was born on Dec. 28, 1932, in Hamilton, Ontario, where his father was a furrier. He joined the Rangers’ junior team at Guelph, Ontario, at 16, and was called up after three seasons there.Howell was the Ranger captain for two seasons in the 1950s and was voted the team’s most popular player for three consecutive seasons in the 1960s.He developed back problems leading to spinal-fusion surgery before the 1969-70 season. The Rangers offered him a management post, but he wanted to continue playing and was sold to the Oakland Seals.After leaving the Rangers, Howell played another four seasons in the N.H.L., in the Bay Area and with the Los Angeles Kings, then moved to the World Hockey Association in 1973. He was a player-coach for the New York Golden Blades/New Jersey Knights franchise for one season, held the dual role when the team became the San Diego Mariners the following season, then concluded his career playing for the Calgary Cowboys, retiring in 1976 at 43.He had 94 goals and 324 assists in the N.H.L., playing in 1,411 games, and 7 goals and 36 assists in the W.H.A., appearing in 170 games.Howell was later general manager of the N.H.L.’s Cleveland Barons and briefly head coach of the Minnesota North Stars, and he scouted for the Rangers and the Edmonton Oilers.Howell, who had worn No. 3 with the Rangers, and Bathgate, who had donned No. 9, were honored at the Garden in February 2009 when their jersey numbers were retired (in Bathgate’s case for a second time, since Adam Graves’s No. 9 had already been retired). Bathgate died in 2016.And Howell was selected to represent the Rangers when Canada Post issued a series of stamps in October 2014 honoring a star defenseman from each team in the N.H.L.’s Original Six, predating the league expansion of 1967.Howell’s survivors include his daughter, Cheryl. His wife, Marilyn, died several weeks ago. A younger brother, Ron, who played briefly for the Rangers in the mid-1950s, died in 1992.The Rangers never got beyond the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs when Howell played for them. But he did have his name etched on the Cup, when he scouted for the Oilers team that won the 1990 N.H.L. championship.“I wish it could have been with the Rangers,” he once remarked, “but a ring is still a ring.”"
"Rangers Trade Mats Zuccarello to Stars for 2 Draft Picks - The New York Times
The rebuilding Rangers traded Mats Zuccarello, the Norwegian forward who became a fan favorite in New York, to the Dallas Stars on Saturday night for two conditional draft picks.Zuccarello, 31, has accumulated 113 goals and 239 assists in 509 games with the Rangers, who signed him in May 2010 after the 5-foot-7 skater caught their attention at the Vancouver Olympics.In return for Zuccarello, the Rangers received a second-round pick in this June’s draft, and a third-round pick in 2020. The second-round pick will become a first-round selection if Dallas wins two playoff rounds this spring and Zuccarello plays half of the games in those two rounds. The 2020 draft pick will become a first-round selection if Zuccarello, who can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, signs a new contract with the Stars.The Rangers must pay 30 percent of the remainder of Zuccarello’s $4.5 million salary for the rest of this season.Zuccarello has led the Rangers in scoring each of the last three seasons, and has 11 goals and 26 assists in 46 games this season. He played his last game with the team on Thursday, a 4-1 loss to the Minnesota Wild at Madison Square Garden.“I have fun every time I play hockey. I have fun every time I am in this rink,” Zuccarello said in a quiet Rangers locker room after that game. “Whatever happens, happens.”The return in the deal seems underwhelming for the Rangers, who may still trade forward Kevin Hayes, a pending unrestricted free agent, and defenseman Adam McQuaid before Monday’s 3 p.m. deadline.In Saturday’s 5-2 home win over the Devils, Zuccarello, Hayes and McQuaid were scratched. Mika Zibanejad, Zuccarello’s high-scoring linemate, spoke of the Rangers’ emotional state with the trade deadline looming.“Mats is a really good friend of mine,” said Zibanejad, whose pregame ritual includes sharing a hug with Zuccarello at the end of warm-ups. “Not seeing him be part of the team before the game and being out there with us, it’s tough. But that’s the business.”"
"Companies Falsely Labeled Products ‘Made in U.S.A.’ Their Financial Penalty? $0. - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Patriot Puck, a New York-based company, wrapped its hockey pucks in American flags, declaring them “The Only American Made Hockey Puck!”The mattress firm Nectar Sleep, founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, promoted its mattresses as “designed and assembled in the U.S.A.”Two California-based manufacturers of deployment bags, tactical gear and other merchandise marketed to active and retired American military personnel sold the products online as #MadeInUSA, and inserted “American Made” tags into its products.In reality, most of the products were manufactured entirely in China, according to the Federal Trade Commission.Last fall, the F.T.C. determined that all four companies had violated federal law by engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts” and falsely marketing their goods as American-made.But while President Trump has accused China of destroying American jobs and prioritized strengthening United States manufacturing, his appointees at the F.T.C. did little to punish the firms. The companies faced no fines and were not required to admit any wrongdoing or to notify customers of their false marketing. The trade commission entered into proposed consent agreements with each firm barring them from falsely marketing their products with the threat of fines if they violated the agreement. A final decision on the penalties is expected in the coming weeks after a public comment period ends.The trade commission’s treatment of the companies has angered Democratic lawmakers, who are urging the Trump administration to pursue tougher punishments for companies that profit by producing products in China and falsely labeling them as American-made.“We call on the commission to do more to protect American manufacturers and consumers,” a group of senators wrote to the F.T.C. last month. Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin asked the agency to “provide specific insights about the commission’s decision to seek no consequences in these brazen instances of fraudulently labeling goods as ‘Made in the USA.’”From the campaign trail to the White House, Mr. Trump has directed much of his focus to rebuilding American jobs and industries. In April 2017, Mr. Trump signed a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order, with the goal of promoting the use of “American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.”Mr. Trump has put a particular focus on revitalizing American manufacturing, which he says has been decimated by cheap Chinese labor and materials.That has Democrats questioning why the agency is not being more aggressive in going after American companies that manufacture their goods in China.“Many companies that manufacture at home are already treading water,” Rohit Chopra, a Democratic F.T.C. commissioner who disagreed with the decision, said in an interview. “American companies shouldn’t lose out to corporate cheaters who lie on their labels.”Mr. Brown, who is considering running for president, said the agency’s penalty did not match the severity of the companies’ behavior.“If companies that break our laws do not face financial penalties, then our American manufacturers are severely undermined,” Mr. Brown said. “We need stronger enforcement by the F.T.C. and greater transparency when it comes to the commission’s actions to crack down on these violators.”Some agency officials, including one of its two Democratic commissioners, defended the settlement, saying that the threat of future penalties was a strong deterrent. The companies face a $40,000 penalty per violation if they are caught making false claims again. And officials said the agency did not seek monetary relief, in part, because there was no “price premium,” meaning the goods were not more expensive than similar products sold by competitors, who also imported their products but did not falsely label them as American-made.“In our view, a thoughtful review and forward-looking plan is a more effective and efficient use of commission resources than reopening and relitigating the cases before us today,” Joseph J. Simons, the F.T.C. chairman, and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner, wrote in a statement in September.But at least one company has complained to the commission, alleging in a letter that the backpack manufacturer’s misleading claim cost it lucrative contracts.“Sandpiper caused confusion to at least one organizational buyer at the Army and Air Force Exchange Service looking for ‘Made in the USA’ products,” Alan Watts, a lawyer representing a competing company, Advantus, wrote to the commission in October. “This caused a very real unfair competitive disadvantage to Advantus whose compliance with the law caused it to lose sales.”The F.T.C. has a long history of weak enforcement in “Made in America” cases that preceded Mr. Trump’s tenure. The commission lists on its website 26 “Made in America” cases it has reviewed since 1999. In some of those cases, companies have agreed to a monetary settlement. In 2016, for instance, Chemence, a specialty chemical company, agreed to pay $220,000 to resolve an agency lawsuit. But in many other cases, the settlements required only record-keeping and reporting requirements to make sure companies did not violate the law again.The commission first found out about the false “Made in America” claims made by the four companies in question now through a dedicated complaint line, according to James Kohm, associate director of the enforcement division for the Bureau of Consumer Protection.Mr. Kohm, in an interview, noted that Patriot Pucks went out of business shortly after the F.T.C.’s first ruling in September, and that Sandpiper, one of the tactical gear manufacturers, was sold to a new owner last fall while the company was involved in litigation with the commission.“We’ve reached a preliminary agreement, whereby the company has not been required to admit any liability,” said a lawyer representing Piper Gear, the second tactical gear maker. He said he could not comment further because the settlement was not final.After a public comment period, which included the questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the commission is expected to issue a final notice on the cases in the coming weeks. The senators, along with Mr. Chopra, are pressing to change the settlement to further penalize the wrongdoers.“The commission should consider remedies tailored to the individual circumstances of the fraud, including redress and notice for consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, opt-in return programs, or admissions of wrongdoing,” Mr. Chopra wrote in a dissenting statement."
"Who’s Investigating Justin Trudeau — and What Do They Hope to Find? - The New York Times
In Canada, the House of Commons’ justice committee generally goes about its work in earnest obscurity. Jody Wilson-Raybould, a former cabinet minister, dramatically changed that with her appearance on Wednesday, which stretched on for almost four hours.[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]Ms. Wilson-Raybould accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his aides and others of applying improper pressure and making “veiled threats” to get her to reach a settlement in a criminal corruption case involving SNC-Lavalin, the major construction and engineering company in Montreal.We did, of course, keep a watch on her testimony, its immediate aftermath and the possible consequences for Mr. Trudeau:[Read: Trudeau Promised a Fresh Approach to Politics. Now He’s Embroiled in Scandal][Read: Trudeau’s Political Woes Mount With Demands for More Inquiries][Read: Trudeau’s Ex-Attorney General: ‘Veiled Threats’ Were Made to Drop Case]It’s risky to predict how this will all play out, both in the short term and for October’s federal election. That’s in part because those outcomes will likely be affected by a series of investigations, both active and proposed, into the actions of the prime minister and his aides.Here’s a look at who’s seeking answers, what they could uncover, and who else might still take a peek:What’s Already Underway• Parliamentary hearings: The House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Justice is where Ms. Wilson-Raybould finally broke her silence this week. It’s also where other key players are set to appear, notably Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau’s friend who stepped down last month as his top political adviser amid the scandal.But the justice committee isn’t set up to run a full-scale investigation. It has neither a team of people digging up evidence, nor the power to order up internal government documents.And, as the opposition has repeatedly pointed out this week, the Liberals control the committee. This makes it unlikely that anything the panel does will inflict much harm on Mr. Trudeau.• An ethics investigation: After a request from two New Democratic Party lawmakers, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, is also on the case. But by law, he can only look for possible conflicts of interest.Simply applying pressure for political advantage doesn’t amount to such a conflict, earlier commissioners have ruled. Past investigations by the ethics commissioner’s office have dragged on for more than a year, and the office has no power to order serious sanctions.What May Come Next• A criminal investigation: The Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and others have asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to look into possible obstruction of justice. The police force, citing standard policy, will not confirm whether it’s started an investigation or plans to do so.And there’s a good chance that we’ll never know whether the Mounties made Mr. Trudeau the target of an investigation. The reason goes back to 2005, when the force sent a fax to a New Democratic member of Parliament confirming that it was investigating then-Finance Minister Ralph Goodale in connection with illegal stock trading. Arriving in the midst of a federal election campaign, the fax exploded like a bomb. Mr. Goodale was cleared; a public servant in the finance department later pleaded guilty to insider trading charges.An investigation later found no fault with the police force, but the Mounties were widely criticized as having meddled in politics. They have been more circumspect about politically sensitive investigations since then.Today, as Mr. Trudeau’s public safety minister, Mr. Goodale oversees the Mounties.•An independent public inquiry: Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democrats, was the first to push for an independent special commission to look into the affair, and the idea has support from other opposition parties.Mr. Trudeau has taken the position that the Justice Committee hearings and the conflict of interest investigation are all that’s needed.An inquiry is the least appealing option for the Liberals, who remember all too well the Gomery Commission. Then-Prime Minister Paul Martin meant for it to clear the air around the Liberals after a corruption scandal involving the previous Liberal government. But it backfired. Evidence presented at the inquiry only highlighted the corruption, and Mr. Martin’s loss in the 2006 election was widely attributed to the hearings.Any inquiry into the current scandal is unlikely to be finished before October’s vote. But the hearings would certainly provide the kind of publicity the Liberals don’t want leading up to, and during, an election campaign.—This week’s Trans Canada and Around The Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the Canada audience growth editor.—Hockey Night with Huawei?

"Longtime N.H.L. Powers Adjust to the View From the Bottom - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — From 2009 to 2018, the Los Angeles Kings, the Anaheim Ducks and the Chicago Blackhawks combined for 10 trips to the Western Conference finals and five Stanley Cups.With one week left in the N.H.L. regular season, the Kings sit last in the conference with the Ducks directly in front of them, while the Blackhawks find themselves in the Central Division cellar for the second straight season.“It’s shocking to me, to be honest,” Kings defenseman Drew Doughty said.Some peaks and valleys can be expected in a league with a hard salary cap and a draft system in which poor-finishing franchises gain immediate access to elite talent. But this season, particularly in the Western Conference, big-market American powers have largely fallen behind smaller market franchises like the Central Division-leading Winnipeg Jets and the Pacific-leading Calgary Flames. The upending of the standings has been accelerated by a youth movement across the sport that has not discriminated based on population or popularity.Entering Saturday’s games, eight of the top 12 scorers are under age 25. High-scoring young stars likely to be seen in the playoffs include Tampa right wing Nikita Kucherov, 25, the league leader in scoring, as well as Colorado center Nathan MacKinnon, 23, Calgary left wing Johnny Gaudreau, 25, and Toronto right wing Mitch Marner, 21.“The young guys are taking over the N.H.L., and these teams that are now at the top of their division, they weren’t when we were five years ago,” Doughty said. “It just shows you that you need to keep rebuilding, you need to have good draft picks to try to get some great players.”The West is striking in its upheaval, with only the San Jose Sharks managing to integrate new players into their veteran nucleus and remain in the playoff picture on a nearly annual basis. The Ducks, the Kings and the Blackhawks have largely been left behind as the game has evolved and have only recently begun to restock prospects.A full-scale changing of the guard has not yet hit the East, where veteran teams like the Lightning, the Capitals and the Penguins are still at or near the top. Still, the Rangers, longtime contenders now in rebuilding mode, will miss the playoffs for the second year in a row, while the Carolina Hurricanes, one of the youngest teams in the league, are closing in on their first playoff berth in 10 years.“A lot of teams believe that you can turn things around by restarting and getting the right type of pieces,” Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist said. “I see it all over the league.”The Kings’ strategy since winning the Cup in 2014 left them all in on unsuccessful seasons and practically all out of promising prospects. They traded a first-rounder and goalie Martin Jones in 2015 for what turned out to be one season from left wing Milan Lucic. Jones would be traded to San Jose and help lead the Sharks to a Stanley Cup finals berth. The Kings then traded another first-rounder for defenseman Andrej Sekera, who played only 16 games for the team as their cupboard emptied.“That’s part of the price you pay for winning,” said wing Dustin Brown, who captained the Kings to Stanley Cups in 2012 and 2014. “I think you can ask any player who was part of those championship teams, would they do anything differently? If you said we could go back and do it all over again, the same stuff would happen because two championships, what more can you ask for?”Last season the Kings squeaked into the playoffs, only to be swept by the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in the first round. Their big off-season move was to sign 35-year-old Ilya Kovalchuk from the Kontinental Hockey League, a move that has been a bust while other core veterans like forward Jeff Carter struggled. Kovalchuk has been a healthy scratch, opting to not even travel with the team of late. Los Angeles made one coaching change already and will almost surely make another at year’s end.The Ducks also committed heavily to their existing nucleus, including right wing Corey Perry and center Ryan Kesler, and then were stalled by a series of significant injuries.Coach Randy Carlyle was fired in February after a calamitous stretch that saw the team lose 19 of 21 games. General Manager Bob Murray, 64, stepped behind the bench for the first time in his career to evaluate his players, coaches and even his auxiliary staff for the remainder of the season, after which Anaheim too is all but certain to make another coaching change.Carlyle coached the Ducks to a Stanley Cup in 2007 and a conference finals appearance in this second stint with the team in 2017. But Anaheim was swept by the Sharks in the first round of the playoffs last season, and Carlyle, known for his demanding old-school approach, appeared to lose the locker room during this turbulent season. The assistant coach Mark Morrison said that under Murray, the environment around the team was more upbeat and egalitarian.For Chicago, sweeping changes began in 2017 after the top-seeded Blackhawks were swept in the first round by a Predators team that went on to the Stanley Cup finals. Much as they did in 2010 following the first of three Stanley Cups in recent years, the Blackhawks faced a salary cap crunch that led to tough decisions. They jettisoned most of their defensive depth and left wing Artemi Panarin, who is now the leading scorer of the Columbus Blue Jackets, who are in playoff position in the East.“Your younger players get better, everyone wants raises and it’s tough to keep teams together,” right wing Patrick Kane said. “We’ve seen that a few times with our team where we’ve had to dismantle the team and make some changes.”This season Chicago fired Joel Quenneville, who has the second-most coaching wins in league history, and promoted Jeremy Colliton from their American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Ill.Colliton, who at 33 is the youngest coach in the N.H.L., said his team had been “making strides” during his tenure. The Blackhawks have gotten breakout performances from the 21-year-old wing Alex DeBrincat, defenseman Erik Gustafsson and the trade acquisition center Dylan Strome, 22. Kane and center Jonathan Toews have continued to play at a high level while pieces have shuffled around them.Yet in the N.H.L., hope springs eternal. The same parity that once elevated teams like Los Angeles, Chicago and Pittsburgh from obscurity to prominence is more prevalent than ever.With most of the regular season complete, seven of the 16 playoff berths remain up for grabs. Teams like St Louis and Carolina have vaulted from the margins of the league into playoff positions. If the season ended Friday, there would be five new playoff teams that did not qualify last season.“It’s a fine line: You can end up dead last in your division one year and at the top next year, and vice versa,” Toews said. “If you can limit those lulls where you have losing streaks that really hurt you in the standings, then anything can happen.”"

"Ejection Letters - The New York Times
SUNDAY PUZZLE — Natan Last has a tremendous record for introducing elegant new entries (how had we lived without CAFFEINE FIX?) and a sharp eye for the type of wordplay that sneaks up on you (and, if you’re me, keeps right on going, just overhead). This is one of those puzzles. The solve is greatly enhanced by today’s constructor notes, so glean what details you can from Mr. Last — he mentors, and teaches people how to do this stuff, and has the type of loopy and flexible mind that slots together intricate bits and pieces to form a cohesive whole. It’s quite amazing.We’ve had a run of prominent Sunday themes that underpin an entire big grid. A bright puzzle like this, where one has to tease the tendrils of the theme out during the entire solve, is a lot of fun and a little bit of a palate cleanser.Much inscrutability today in that tendriled theme — if you don’t find what you’re looking for here, move on down a section.7A: A heartbreaking state of affairs, in the days of waning print circulation and instant feedback, is the lonely journalist sitting in the dark with his or her analytics panel open anxiously watching the CLICKS. There’s no market for quality over quantity anymore. (All of you are quality clicks, friends. High-class clicks.)71A: I don’t know if you’ve spent time in Louisiana or otherwise had the opportunity to “fais do-do,” or make a party happen, but if you have, then “makin’ groceries” probably sounded CAJUN to you. 72A: These are both astrological signs and AUTOS. If you happened to wonder if there was ever a “Scorpio” car, there was! It was gorgeous.2D: C.B. radios and their lingo go back about a century, and members of the “10 code,” common or relevant phrases that are coded to the number 10 with another number, were used by the police in the 1930s to make communication easier. It makes sense that TEN ONE would establish, right off the bat, that communication via the radio was staticky, faint or otherwise difficult to understand. Intentionally or not, the crossing here with SHE BEAR was cute because that could be a female cop. If a SHE BEAR in a plain brown wrapper takes your picture and turns on the bubble gum machine, you might be about to get a driving award.6D: The Nylons sang “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” and the Rayons sang “Do You Love Me.” Three makes a (highly synthetic) pattern; I always figured these bands were using the fabric names to be modern and slick, but the ORLONS apparently took their name as a spoof of a popular group at their high school, the Cashmeres. This was not the Cashmeres, by the way, who also had hits in the 60s.41D: Who else had “egg roll” at first? White House propaganda. If you went straight to EGG HUNT, maybe you thought of the Easter beagle.77D: After a 40-plus year absence, this is the second appearance in a few months of GAY PAREE, which looks so odd but was, as spelled, the title of a 1926 Broadway musical revue, and also in a title of a Cole Porter song for the 1953 show “Can-Can.”93D: This might have been the crunchiest “straight” clue today, heralding the 21st-century debut of OTOMI, or Hñäñhü, people of Central Mexico. I had never put a name to these marvelous textiles, but the Otomi are known for beautiful embroidery.There is a fairly well-known sporting event on telly this evening, so your minds may have been tuned to that frequency already, and we have a theme today that revolves around sportsmanship, or rather lack thereof, in four major athletic leagues — M.L.B. baseball, N.F.L. football, FIFA soccer and N.B.A. basketball. We seem to be missing N.H.L. hockey, probably because it’s difficult to play attempted murder for laughs, and that is what it takes to get thrown out of a hockey match (or so I thought — more on that later).There are three layers to each sports “play,” we’ll call them. The first two are codependent so we’ll address them together.First, there are four italicized clues, each linked to another entry — these are at 28A (linking to 102A), 48A (linking to 105A), 64A (linking to 87A) and 86D (linking to 65A). Each of these italicized clues refers to a star from one of the above sports leagues, getting “ejected,” or thrown out, of the entry that’s linked.Second, we have those linked clues, referred to above. Each is straightforward, but too tricky to come up with, at least for me, without a ton of crossing letters filled in. Even then, though, there’s a problem. Let’s look at the first example, 28A, “N.F.L. star ejected from 102-Across,” and 102A, “Entry fee.”I am enough of a nonfan to solve RICE at 28A, purely on the crosses, and have no idea who RICE is. (Not that it matters in this case, just letting you know — I did look all these guys up for the column, but totally drew a blank here to the point that I didn’t instantly connect RICE to a last name and wondered for a while what starchy grains had to do with anything.)At 102A, I had enough down entries pretty confidently inked to get __ __ __ ADMISSION, then __ OF ADMISSION, at which point the first notion of a rebus dawned on me. But I still racked my brain for a bit, getting stuck on “cost” or “rate” before filling in 92D, getting the “p” in ROPED at the beginning of 102A, and everything clicked. We’re looking at the P(RICE) OF ADMISSION. Jerry RICE was a 20-season N.F.L. star who most call the greatest wide receiver of all time. I don’t want to spoil all four, but at the same time they are each pretty tricky, so here are some hints, in gradients:48A, the “N.B.A. star ejected from 105-across,” is a modern-era basketball center who was probably more famous for getting fouled than getting ejected.64A, the “M.L.B. star ejected from 87-across,” is one of the original superstars of baseball who is famous for cursing an entire city.86D, the “FIFA star ejected from 65-across,” is an Argentine soccer (football) forward who plays for Barcelona and has scored more goals than anyone except Ronaldo in their league.Other than scratching my head a little bit at 87A I thought these theme entries were a total riot.I mentioned a tertiary element, one that was quite edifying to yours truly and anyone else who is unfamiliar with the heartbreak of losing a favorite player to expulsion for some imaginary (or real) affront. Mr. Last has helpfully included, at 21A, 22A, 33A and 58A, actions that will get you ejected while playing each of the sports in question — a BEAN BALL, an ILLEGAL SLIDE TACKLE (sounds stylishly painful, very European), a HELMET HIT and a FLAGRANT FOUL. This last one does remind me of passionately rooting for John Starks back in the early 90s when the Knicks physically manifested most of Greek mythology — Sisyphus, Pandora, Icarus, Narcissus, Frustratus. I also thought of every crossword solver’s favorite hockey player, Bobby Orr, and thought he could figure in a cute “S(orr)y not s(orr)y” entry or some such pun. But this grid was plenty stuffed with theme, and very satisfying.Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. What did you think?"
"TIPPING OFF: First 2 Final 4 Spots on the Line - The New York Times
The first two spots in the Final Four will be decided on Saturday. Both games will be strength against strength.In the West Region, Gonzaga and the best offense in Division I will face Texas Tech and the nation's best defense.The South Region will have a similar vibe with high-scoring guard Carsen Edwards and Purdue playing Virginia and its stingy D.Led the head-butting begin.Gonzaga (33-3), the top seed in the West, whips the ball around like tic-tack-toe passes in hockey, five players often touching the ball in a matter of seconds to set up the best shot possible.The Zags are the highest-scoring, best-shooting and most lopsided-winning team in the nation. They are the most efficient offense, according to KenPom.com, and had double-digit wins over their first three opponents to reach the Elite Eight for the fourth time.Gonzaga can shoot from the outside, has one of the nation's best frontcourts and can be unstoppable when they get their transition game going.""That's what it's like every night in the Big 12,"" Texas Tech coach Chris Beard said. ""You're playing against NBA players, not a lot of one-dimensional guys either, guys that can do different things.""The Zags will have their hands full in Anaheim, California, against third-seeded Texas Tech (29-6), which turned its Sweet 16 game against Michigan into a stomping.Michigan's bid to reach its second straight Final Four ran into a big Red Raiders wall. Texas Tech closed up the middle, contested jumpers and turned away nearly everything the Wolverines attempted at the rim.The Red Raiders held Michigan to 44 points, 32 percent shooting and 1 for 19 on its 3-point attempts.That, of course, is no surprise coming from KenPom's most efficient defense.""Texas Tech's is just tough as nails, don't make a mistake, don't miss an assignment, gap oriented, with all their help built in and a real conviction to guard you as a team,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""And it's tough. They don't give you any easy shots and they're very handsy, and they attempt to take a lot of charges, too.""A mirror image could play out across the country in Louisville, Kentucky.VIRGINIA-PURDUETop-seeded Virginia has made its calling card defense under coach Tony Bennett and the Cavaliers have stifled their way into the Elite Eight.Virginia has yet to allow more 54 points in the NCAA Tournament and makes opponents feel as if the Cavaliers have six players on the court. Virginia has superb interior defense and puts lots of pressure on ball-handers, forcing opponents into mistakes and missed shots.To reach the Final Four for the first time since 1980, the Boilermakers will have to find some way to solve that stingy D.""For the most part, Virginia, I feel like is apart from a lot of teams defensively,"" Edwards said. ""It will be something different for us.""So will guarding Edwards for the Cavaliers.The junior guard averages 23.8 points per game despite constant attention from opposing defense and can be nearly unstoppable when he gets hot. Edwards had it going against Tennessee in the Sweet 16, scoring 29 points and hit two free throws to send the game to overtime in the 99-94 victory.If Virginia is to break its 35-year Final Four drought, it will have to at least slow Edwards.""When you play players that are that special, that can shoot from unlimited range, you just do your best as a team to make it hard for him, and then individually to make him hit tough, contested shots,"" Bennett said. ""That's always the goal of the defense.""___"
"Here’s What Happens When 2 Sons Buy a Billboard Asking for Birthday Wishes for Their Dad - The New York Times
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]It’s one thing to get an out-of-the-blue birthday call from a friend. It’s another to get 20,000 from strangers around the world.Chris Ferry, a 61-year-old insurance agent from Linwood, N.J., found himself fielding calls from as far away as Germany, the Philippines and Kenya after his two sons surprised him with a now-viral birthday prank: his face and phone number plastered on a billboard over the Black Horse Pike highway stretching toward Atlantic City.“WISH MY DAD HAPPY BIRTHDAY,” the sign blared, just above his cellphone number. “Love, Your Sons.”Mr. Ferry’s sons — Michael, 28, and Christopher, 30 — moved to Florida from New Jersey more than five years ago after struggles with substance abuse. The two now run a drug abuse clinic in Boca Raton.The men grew up in Ventnor City, just outside Atlantic City, and had been playing birthday pranks on their father ever since they were young boys traveling to hockey tournaments. Both recalled getting into silly-string-type trouble at the hotels, and always telling waiters and waitresses at restaurants that it was their father’s birthday.“Hundreds of times,” Christopher Ferry said. “And never on his birthday.”This week’s gift was just a continuation of that loving jest, but it took on far more momentum than they ever anticipated.“The ultimate prank,” Christopher Ferry said.The idea grew out of a conversation about what to get their father for his 62nd birthday, which is Saturday. The older son said inspiration struck as he was on the phone with the billboard company Interstate to order advertising for his Florida drug treatment center.“He’s going to kill us,” his younger brother recalled thinking.The sons had expected some friends, relatives and a few locals from their small New Jersey town to call Mr. Ferry, and maybe crack a few jokes.But on Wednesday last week, when the billboard was installed, Christopher Ferry posted a selfie that his father had taken with the billboard and shared it on Facebook. Before long, the post had over 200 shares. The rest is high-jinks history.Their father has gotten an estimated 20,000 telephone calls and thousands of texts.“He’s actually handled it really well, but last night he was a bit overwhelmed,” Michael Ferry said. “He deleted about 3,000 texts, which took him about an hour and a half to do, and then got about 2,500 within 15 minutes when more news stories aired across the country.”Despite the nuisance factor, the sons said they were happy to see their father get so much attention.“You know, we’ve tortured him for years,” Michael Ferry said. “He’s our dad, and he had to see us through our drug addictions and it really took a toll on him. So, we wanted to do something really nice for him, while also taking a little jab.”Unless their father threatens to disown them, the men said the $2,000 billboard would remain on that stretch of New Jersey highway until April 6.On Wednesday, Mr. Ferry was no longer answering calls to the number plastered on the billboard. He was busy, according to his wife and sons, at the AT&T store ordering a new phone line."
"Cardiac Contraction - The New York Times
SATURDAY PUZZLE —  I’ll get to the clues quickly today because I thought there were so many sticklers, but this puzzle was very twinny, or crossy, for me — lots of paired entries. Some of them had something in common, some were nigh impossible to complete, some combined to aid me greatly, but this facet was one of the takeaways for me today.As always, I loved Sam Trabucco’s style and got a kick out of his cluing and most of today’s nine debuts. (The meh ones were I COULDN’T and HOME CARE, not that there’s anything wrong with either one, they just weren’t remarkable. Certainly not a constructor’s fault.)The first clues that delighted me were VILA and VANILLI, which I would call a personal reverse Natick, since I was able to ink them in with total confidence. I misremembered Bob Vila as a character on a sitcom, “Home Improvement,” not an educational show, “Home Again,” but I’m still a little afraid to get on a ladder — no D.I.Y. expert here. I also misremembered the whole Milli Vanilli story, which turned very tragic, but their music is very embedded in my mind with my college experience, so any mention makes me pleasantly nostalgic (this is only the second time we’ve seen VANILLI, and it’s been more than 20 years). My college memories are free of PEP BANDS, by the way, which was also a debut. After picking through much of the upper right, my letters spread south and west, petering out at the lower left corner, which stumped me most. There was tough stuff, though, throughout this whole grid.A couple of misdirections I was fond of were clues for ESP and GLAND, and there were fun clues galore. ARIE, clued as such, made me grimace for a second, but I didn’t dwell on it.13A: I thought “overrode” had to be the thing here, for “Domineered,” and rolled my eyes a little at OVERBORE, which doesn’t strike me as a word. Wrong! It has even been in the puzzle before, multiple times. I was not overbored by this grid today, Mr. Trabucco, I feel you went quite overboard to amuse us. 15A: I am pre-nostalgic for the group in question here, the modern and still-existent GORILLAZ. This is one of those very insidery double clues, by the way; one of the founders of GORILLAZ is Damon Albarn, who is also in Blur, one of the bands mentioned in the crossing clue at 4D. I actually knew this, but I didn’t think of him as a poster child for BRITPOP (even though he is, as I learned once I consulted the world); I also had always assumed that GORILLAZ was a hipster misspelling of “guerrillas,” not anything to do with the Monkees. So there’s another bit of critical life information we’ve acquired today. I had never actually seen the humans behind the band in question, because they are often represented by cartoon characters, even when I’ve seen videos of them performing live.16A: Right after a 21st-century pop music reference, bam! An abstruse compendium of world literary figures like Jeppe Aakjaer, a novelist who “was intensely concerned with social misery and the need for reform.” BENET’S Reader’s Encyclopedia was first edited, in 1948, by William Rose Benét, older brother of Stephen Vincent. There was an edition in 2008; there may be one in the works right now.44A: In a rebuttal to the old “Plus ça change” argument, some aficionados among you may find it bemusing that this word, LICTORS, and its singular variant, were considered entries for early in the week, including a Monday puzzle back in 1954 (clued as “Fasces bearer in ancient Rome”). I was inordinately stumped by this entry and hit a dead end at its crossing with 45D, too, as I knew nothing of California’s Fort ORD. That little filler word is usually clued as an airport. 7D: It felt as if the four 12-letter entries in this puzzle split into pairs, with this one, the punnily clued DRAMA COACHES, crossing IM SPEECHLESS.8D, which referenced the top entry on a Sports Illustrated list that I had certainly heard about but never examined, was one half of the other pair of 12-letter entries. The entry here is MIRACLE ON ICE — the unlikely 1980 Olympic hockey victory that was all rife with Cold War gravitas and rah rah United States patriotism. I’m just not familiar, except that I worked with one of the Times reporters who covered it, the perspicacious Craig Whitney, and he was still telling pretty riveting stories 25 years later in the newsroom. (It looks as if he took some part in a documentary, in case this event is also your No. 1 and you want more, more, more.)As far as 27A, the 12-letter entry crossing the above, this idiom made me think of my No. 1 “moment in sports history,” which was at 13 on the Sports Illustrated list. Can a horse PUT ON A CLINIC? It’s not like we could ask any of the rivals he left far, far behind in the dust; they would just shake their heads and murmur “neigh.” Is it silly that I get a little teary whenever I see Secretariat looking as if he could have soared 10 more miles with a sack of potatoes on his back?Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. What did you think?"
"The Strange Story Behind the SNC-Lavalin Affair - The New York Times
Seven years ago, Elisabeth Malkin, my colleague in Mexico City, and I worked on one of the strangest stories of my career. It involved a consultant from Mount Forest, Ontario, with no previous experience in the Middle East being sent by construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to assess the turmoil in Libya that eventually led to the overthrow of its dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.For $100,000, the consultant, Cynthia Vanier, wrote a five-page report condemning the NATO-led bombing campaign against Colonel Qaddafi’s forces. She wound up in a Mexican jail, charged with trying to smuggle the dictator’s son into that country, and remained there for 18 months.It was among a series of episodes that exposed widespread corruption at SNC-Lavalin, led to the firing of its top executives (several of whom were arrested) and raised questions about the survival of the company.Now, of course, SNC-Lavalin’s time with the Qaddafi family is at the heart of a political mess confronting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just eight months before a federal election.[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]It began over a week ago when The Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources (subscribers only), reported that when Jody Wilson-Raybould was justice minister, Mr. Trudeau or his aides pressured her to cut a deal that would allow SNC-Lavalin to escape a criminal conviction for bribery in Libya. That was followed this week by the announcement of an investigation by Parliament’s ethics commissioner into Mr. Trudeau’s actions. Then came the abrupt resignation of Ms. Wilson-Raybould from Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet.Let’s step back for a quick overview of SNC-Lavalin’s troubled history, and where Trudeau’s current problem may lead:•What is SNC-Lavalin? SNC-Lavalin was formed in 1991 from two Montreal-based companies. It has 52,000 employees in over 160 countries and reported revenue of 9.3 billion Canadian dollars in 2017. Like Bombardier, SNC-Lavalin’s international success remains a source of pride in Quebec, despite the latter’s issues with corruption, and it employs thousands of people there.•What did it do? The current controversy comes from charges laid by the police four years ago. They accuse the company of paying 47.7 million Canadian dollars in bribes to officials in Libya to win contracts there, and of defrauding the Libyan government and its agencies of 129.8 million Canadian dollars.But that’s not all. In 2013, the World Bank banned SNC-Lavalin from bidding on contracts for a decade to settle a corruption inquiry into its activities in Bangladesh. An Indian government investigation showed that the company paid bribes there where it built a major hydroelectric dam.Back home, Pierre Duhaime, SNC-Lavalin’s former chief executive, pleaded guilty this month to charges related to tens of millions of dollars in bribes the company paid to secure the contract to build a hospital complex in Montreal. A public official has pleaded guilty to taking bribes from SNC-Lavalin that landed it the contract to renovate the landmark Jacques-Cartier bridge in Montreal.•What’s at stake? If convicted in the Libya case, SNC-Lavalin will be banned from federal government contracts for a decade. Such work is a major part of SNC-Lavalin’s business. Without it, the company could be financially crippled or vulnerable to a takeover by a foreign competitor.•How has it responded? Publicly, the company’s new management claims all bribery and all other forms of lawbreaking are in its past.Privately, it has heavily lobbied politicians at all levels of government and in all parties. The company was looking for changes to criminal law that would allow it to dodge a conviction by paying a large fine and proving that it now has clean hands — the United States and Britain have similar “remediation agreements.”While it made no link, the Trudeau government introduced just such a change to the Criminal Code last March, burying it in the hundreds of pages of the federal budget bill.•What are the allegations against Mr. Trudeau? According to The Globe and Mail, his office improperly pushed Ms. Wilson-Raybould to get federal prosecutors to drop the criminal case and use the new settlement system.The prosecution service is supposed to do its work free of the influence of politicians. Justice ministers in Canada, in their dual role as attorney general, can give prosecutors orders. But that’s only supposed to happen in exceptional cases and the law requires the government to make those orders public through an official notice.In the end, however, nothing happened. SNC-Lavalin is still heading to court.•What’s next? Mr. Trudeau has repeatedly acknowledged that the issue was discussed with his former minister. But he has also insisted that neither he nor his office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who has yet to give her side of the story, citing solicitor-client privilege.Whatever turns the political storm takes, John W. Boscariol, a lawyer in Toronto who advises companies on corruption issues, told me this week that the outcome is unlikely to please SNC-Lavalin.“Now that it’s exploded, it’s going to be difficult for any company to get a remediation agreement,” he said.On Feb. 24 we’re holding a special conference call for Canadian and Australian readers with David Sanger, national security correspondent for The Times.

"Tiny Love Stories: ‘Relationships Are Like Shoes’ - The New York Times
We met in 1968, the year before he became Dartmouth’s hockey captain, when I was one of seven women on Dartmouth’s testosterone-fueled campus of 3,000 men. I joined Denis’s fraternity to be his brother but fell for him instead. He nicknamed us “Romes and Jules” after the Zeffirelli movie. Even though I dumped him for the visiting art professor, he dropped everything to drive me home when my 45-year-old mother lay dying of alcoholism. It was an act of lovingkindness unlike anything I have ever known. Husbands have come and gone, but our 50-year friendship lives on. — Lynn LobbanWe graduated from the same culinary school but met working together at food events. I developed new food products that she styled in photo shoots. For more than 10 years, I ignored my feelings for this beautiful woman: so smart, funny, talented and — married. One night at a cookbook launch party, we stood in a dark studio in Austin, Tex. She told me about her favorite new dish, wings coated with burnt honey. She described it and touched my arm. My vision tunneled. Nothing I could do. Remembering that moment a month later, I recreated the dish. It was delicious. — John BartelMy mother told me relationships are like shoes: No matter how beautiful they are or how much you love them, if they don’t fit there will be pain with every step. Nobody will know it but you. There was pain in my relationship with my boyfriend of eight years, but I had ignored it. I finally understood the true meaning of my mother’s saying when he cheated on me. I don’t hate him or the other woman anymore. I took off the shoes and am free. — Karleen ChiuI flew from the West to the East Coast on a day’s notice. My brother was dying; cancer was winning. I spent three powerful days with him, shadows looming. On my final night, my brother and I went to dinner, our last together. Small talk with interludes of silence, just staring at one another. Declaring our love with words seemed feeble. He was everything a big brother should be to a little sister. Is knowing that it would be the last time together a gift? I think so. Love you, Bob. Miss you big time. — Chris TeicheiraFor couples who park their cars on the street, dealing with alternate-side regulations is the worst. It’s cold, crackling cold.

I pray that the street sweeper will bypass our block. It does. After 90 minutes, I climb back into our cozy bed beside my husband, who murmurs, “Thank you.” Because we both know that sharing city chores is an expression of true love. — Judy Hadlock"
"A Tennis Wish List for 2019 - The New York Times
Not much head scratching is required when it comes to deciding how to start a wish list for tennis in 2019.A sport that has long been concerned about punching below its weight spent too much of last year elbowing itself in the ribs as its too-numerous leaders traded blows and crossed purposes.This is no way to run a niche sport concerned about market and mind share in a ruthlessly competitive global entertainment landscape. Improvement is all the more urgent with tennis’s biggest stars, Roger Federer and Serena Williams, both 37.And so with a new season about to get serious with the start of the Australian Open on Monday, my No. 1 wish for tennis is unity. In an ideal world, that would mean unified governance.“It will never happen, but what we need more than anything is a commissioner,” said Brad Gilbert, the longtime player, coach and analyst.That would require each of tennis’s seven governing bodies to cede some of its authority, a situation that would probably require an existential threat to the game’s viability or profitability.In an imperfect but still better world, unity could also mean a genuine players’ union — why not men and women together while we’re wishing? — that could make for more meaningful progress on tennis’s now-intractable issues through tough negotiations with those who own and operate the tournaments.In the current system, the players and regular tour events are in partnership, an unusual arrangement in professional sports that can make consensus and change difficult.Novak Djokovic, back at No. 1 and president of the ATP Player Council, has explored the concept. But for now, a union appears to be wishful thinking: too many legal and logistical hurdles.But the sport can still do better at finding common ground in 2019.Start with agreeing on a more coherent schedule that does not include three men’s team events within less than four months: the Laver Cup in September 2019, the revamped Davis Cup in November 2019 and the revived ATP Cup in January 2020.Continue by creating a meaningful mixed men’s and women’s team event that will carry on the legacy of the Hopman Cup. Further embrace tennis’s ability to showcase men’s and women’s stars in the same events — a longtime strength that other sports are interested in replicating.Reach an agreement on coaching that will apply to all sectors of the pro game. The women’s tour currently allows on-court coaching visits once a set while the men’s tour and main-draw Grand Slam events do not allow any coaching during play.“If we have it, we should have it nonstop,” said Simona Halep, the women’s No. 1. “If we don’t, we should stop completely.”Halep prefers letting players solve their own tactical and psychological issues under pressure, as do I and plenty of others. But the existing coaching situation is confusing to fans and disorienting to women’s players, who have to change routines in the tournaments that matter most. In light of the difficulty for umpires to fully police player-coach communication, perhaps allowing signals from the box and only the box is the right compromise.More tennis wishes for 2019:ELIMINATE LETS ON SERVES A point or a tournament can already end with a net-cord winner during a rally when a groundstroke, volley or overhead hits the tape and trickles over. Why should a serve be treated any differently? This will also speed play, slightly reduce costs (sensors are used to detect lets) and bring pro tennis in line with college tennis.ELIMINATE PLAYERS’ RIGHT to catch a service toss without penalty. If a player chooses not to hit the ball once tossed, it should count as a missed serve. This will also speed play and, in making the ideal toss more elusive, take away a smidgen of a server’s advantage.MAKE A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT to push tournaments to use balls from the same brands or at least with the same characteristics during the different surface swings: hard court, clay court, grass and indoor. Few things irritate players more than significant disparity between balls week to week, and there is concern that abrupt changes can lead to injury. The ATP is working on this issue. Time to hurry up.PROVIDE PLAYERS AND COACHES with detailed information about court speed and ball characteristics well in advance of a tournament to allow competitors to better prepare. This might also help reduce injuries.PERMIT FANS TO ENTER A STADIUM as the players change ends after the first game of a set. The current policy, which typically does not allow fans to enter until the changeover after the third game, leaves too many paying customers waiting for too long.COOPERATE TO DEVELOP JUST ONE MAJOR RATING SYSTEM for tennis players, be they professional or amateur. The Universal Tennis Rating, with the backing of strong private investors, is making inroads. But the International Tennis Federation is also creating its own rating system and algorithm. Such a system is an important concept that could simplify and improve the transition to the professional game. Why create more tennis confusion with competing systems instead of joining forces to produce one that will be universally accepted?FAIRER USE OF WILD CARDS The Grand Slam tournaments should no longer allow reciprocal wild card entry to players from other Grand Slam nations. It is elitism. And the new-look Davis Cup should definitely not be granting two wild cards to its 18-team final phase. It is anti-competitive.MORE CONSISTENCY IN APPLYING THE RULES on coaching violations, the timing of line-call challenges and the eligibility of convicted administrators to serve on the ITF board of directors.A MEN’S GRAND SLAM SINGLES CHAMPION UNDER AGE 30 (there are none active at the moment) and a new French Open men’s champion. And a first major title for South Africa’s Kevin Anderson, which would be the first for an African in singles in 38 years.ONE MORE MAJOR for Petra Kvitova, who has come back so inspirationally from adversity. Another chance in a major final for Madison Keys to conquer her nerves and play to her potential.MORE VARIETY IN COURT SPEEDS on tour, fewer injury timeouts. More open roofs, less pain for Andy Murray. More drop-shot returns, fewer tweeners. More integrity, fewer conflicts of interest. More conversations, fewer social-media posts. More players, fewer hitters."
"Trying to Change Pro Tennis One Signature at a Time - The New York Times
TORONTO — In a subterranean food court in downtown Toronto, shoppers bustled past Maria Patrascu without a glance, unaware that the young woman sipping green tea was the leader of a growing rebellion in professional tennis.A year ago at this time, Patrascu was a little-known left-hander playing obscure tournaments in Egypt as she tried to get her world ranking under 600. But now she is unable to enter tournaments because of controversial new International Tennis Federation rules designed to slash the ranks of pro players.So instead of playing, Patrascu, 22, remains at home, seeking to upset the I.T.F.’s new World Tennis Tour one signature at a time. But what began as a petition has turned into a surging player revolt that Patrascu, more than any other player, has helped bring to light.“It started out rebellious, but it has definitely evolved,” she said. “It’s just a movement to pursue justice.”About 10 months ago, Patrascu began reading how the I.T.F., one of four governing bodies in tennis, planned to introduce a complicated string of rules to restructure the lower levels of the sport. Patrascu grew alarmed that she and hundreds of young players like her would find it far more difficult to get into tournaments and pursue a tennis career.Last March, Patrascu started an online petition to halt the changes. For many months, it gathered only a modest response — about 2,400 signatures through December. But once the changes took effect in January and thousands of aspiring players felt the full force of the new rules, support for her petition soared.It added more than 12,000 new signatures in just the last six weeks and now has more than 14,500. With Patrascu leading the way, supporters have already extracted one concession from the I.T.F., with more possibly on the way.The movement continues to grow, and some players have met with lawyers to discuss a lawsuit against the I.T.F. Dave Miley, a former federation official and coach who has also opposed the new rules, praised Patrascu and the players and coaches who have joined the fight.“What she and other players are doing is admirable, and they have cause,” Miley said. “To me, 14,000 voices out there are not uninformed.”Professional tennis has several tiers, much like baseball with its major leagues and several levels of minor leagues below them. The best and most famous tennis players play in ATP or WTA tournaments. The rest, as many as 14,000 of them, toil anonymously around the globe in small events that are supposed to serve as tennis’s talent incubator.Patrascu is one of those. Born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1997, she moved to Toronto with her parents when she was 5. She showed promise as a junior, winning the Canadian under-14 championship, and turned professional at 18. But her career-high ranking is No. 615 in the I.T.F. and No. 819 in the WTA.Most players’ chances of making it to stardom are slim, and for many, it is challenging to just break even financially after paying for travel, training and other expenses. That is why the I.T.F., after commissioning an extensive study, declared the old structure unsustainable. Too many marginal players were basically masquerading as professionals.The I.T.F.’s mission is to promote tennis around the world, and the organization works to ensure that there are tournaments on all continents. But those events have been open to all comers, and they have included players with little hope of breaking into the top tier — some of them over 50 years old. The I.T.F. study determined that in one year, as many as 6,000 so-called professional players did not earn even $1. A recent independent investigation also found that there was a “tsunami” of fixed matches at the lower levels, where players earning little prize money are vulnerable to betting syndicates.The I.T.F. determined that the best model for professional tennis should include no more than 750 men and 750 women. It recommended new rules to restructure the tour, effectively eliminating almost 13,000 aspirants.The new system is intended to provide an easier path for the top 100 juniors to matriculate via easier access to bigger tournaments, perhaps at the expense, opponents say, of other players who develop at later ages. (A certain number of spots are reserved at some events for the players in the top 100 junior rankings.) With a smaller pool of truly professional players, the I.T.F. hopes, the meager prize money and ranking points offered at the lower levels could be distributed more efficiently.But Patrascu, and many others who are taking to various platforms to vent their anger, say that hard-working players with real potential are being caught up in the cull as tournament sizes are reduced and ranking points become more difficult to attain.Patrascu said she received so many messages every day from frustrated players detailing their own problems with the new tour that she was unable to reply to them all.“They’re killing the players’ dreams, just to end up with a handful of really, really good players,” she said of the I.T.F. “All the rest are forgotten.”In December, the I.T.F. granted Patrascu a one-hour conference call with the federation officials Jackie Nesbitt and Andrew Moss. Patrascu later said she felt she had let her fellow players down on that call, because she could not stop the new plan.Then, in January, the new tour was introduced and Patrascu’s WTA ranking disappeared, she said. The most jarring change for most players is the limit on entrants for the qualifying rounds, the mini tournaments that allow fringe players to play their way into the main draws, where modest prize money and ranking points were up for grabs. These entries were cut to 24.In the past, many tournaments had large qualifying draws of 48, 64 or even occasionally 128 players.Patrascu explained how the changes in the size of qualifying draws have affected her boyfriend, Kevin Portmann of Italy, who went to a tournament in Tunisia last month and was required to play two pre-qualifying matches on the day he arrived. That was just to get into the qualifying rounds. She said she could not afford to travel to Africa or Europe for tournaments with little hope of reaching the main draw.“You have to win five matches just to be in position to play someone who is totally fresh,” she said. “It’s not fair.”Players are fuming because they now require more points to move up in the rankings, but it is harder to get into the tournaments to get those points. Also, doubles specialists are at a greater disadvantage because singles rankings are now used to determine entry into the doubles draws.As the new reality sinks in, many players and their coaches, families and friends are turning to Patrascu’s petition. Some have followed her initiative with Facebook pages, like the one with a banner headline that reads, “Don’t Kill Tennis.” Rafael Nadal’s uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, who runs the player’s academy, spoke out against the new rules in an Instagram video this month.The I.T.F. insisted that Patrascu’s petition contained “inaccuracies” and said that much of the other criticism had been “uninformed.” But, under siege, it made its first amendment to the new rules last month by expanding qualifying draws to 32 players. The federation also promised to continue monitoring the rules and to act accordingly.“Of course we are listening to the players,” said Kris Dent, the I.T.F.’s senior executive director for pro circuits. “It would be foolish not to listen to our constituents. Change is never easy, but in this case it is vital.”Patrascu said she was encouraged by the revision but said it should only be the start. Meanwhile, her days are spent training indoors in Toronto and stoking the budding rebellion.“I don’t feel like I’m doing this for myself, especially because I’m not sure where my career is headed,” she said. “The time that I’ve dedicated to it is really from the bottom of my heart. I wish players could have more opportunities.”"
"Dan Evans Says He Threw Away His Tennis Career. He’s Trying to Get It Back. - The New York Times
DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Dan Evans finished a practice session last month, grabbed a racket by the strings and marched from the court toward the player locker room.It was the same path walked by Juan Martín del Potro the night before. For del Potro, a flash mob gathered as fans chanted “Olé, Olé, Olé, Delpo, Delpo,” and implored the popular Argentine to autograph photos, tennis balls, hats, T-shirts and even one man’s bald head.When Evans walked the route, just hours before he was to take the court against Radu Albot in the final of the Delray Beach Open on Feb. 24, no one stopped him to chat or ask for his autograph. Not a single spectator recognized Evans, a 28-year-old Briton.He was alone with his thoughts. But he was used to that.For more than a year, Evans spent most of his time alone after being barred from the ATP Tour for a positive drug test for cocaine. Evans said that while he used cocaine recreationally and out of competition, which is not prohibited in tennis, he tested positive during the Barcelona Open in April 2017 when he left some of the drug in a bag that contaminated other medication.Evans, who was ranked a career-high No. 41 at the time of his ban, had recently reached his first career ATP final in Sydney. He did not appeal the charge.The Delray Beach Open was only his fourth ATP Tour tournament since his return in April 2018. He lost the final to Albot in a third-set tiebreaker despite holding three match points, but his ranking is up to No. 100 as he begins the qualifying tournament for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., on Tuesday.With no ability to play tournaments or train during the ban, Evans retreated to his home in Cheltenham on the outskirts of the picturesque Cotswolds, some 90 miles northwest of London. He was forbidden to even practice at any facilities affiliated with Britain’s Lawn Tennis Association for 10 months.He filled his days quietly playing golf and watching television, though he refused to tune in to any tennis matches. He said he would not even follow tournament results in the newspaper. Some days, he said, it was too painful to leave the house.“It was a really tough time in my life,” Evans said. “But there were a lot of other people around me who had a difficult year as well. I would be selfish to think that it didn’t affect everyone else in my life.“Those feelings of anger and hurt at what you did to people don’t go away easily,” Evans added, referring to the pain and embarrassment he caused his family, his girlfriend and a bevy of coaches and supporters.This was not the first time he had been penalized. In 2006, Evans was pulled from the Wimbledon junior tournament by the L.T.A., the national governing body the sport, for unacceptable on-court behavior. Two years later, he was suspended by the L.T.A. for four months after he was photographed during Wimbledon at a nightclub in the early morning hours. And in 2010, the L.T.A. stopped financially supporting him for underperformance and a poor attitude.Evans was unranked when he returned from this latest suspension in April 2018 and was forced to start at the lower levels of professional tennis. With no points to defend, and little compassion from his fellow competitors, Evans began entering Challengers, tennis’s version of the minor leagues. He often had to play three matches just to get into the tournament’s main draw. But in August he won a Challenger in Vancouver, British Columbia, and reached the final of another in France in February.At the ATP Tour level, he was given a wild card to play the event at Queen’s Club in London in June and lost his first match. He tried to qualify for Wimbledon last year, reaching the second round. He qualified for the main draw of this year’s Australian Open and lost to Roger Federer in the second round. His breakthrough at Delray Beach included wins over No. 9 John Isner and No. 35 Frances Tiafoe.“In retrospect, his journey has been incredibly quick for someone with no ranking,” said David Felgate, Tim Henman’s longtime coach, who began working with Evans just after his return. “Dan doesn’t expect anything from anyone; he doesn’t expect sympathy. He knows what he did to himself. But it does give him a different perspective and may prolong his career. When you realized you missed a year, you want to make up for it. You want this career to go on for a long time because you know what not playing felt like.”At 5-foot-9, Evans lacks the serving power of tennis’s taller players like del Potro, who is 6-6. But Evans is scrappy off the ground, particularly with his running forehand pass down the line. He also possesses an effective one-handed slice backhand. And he loves to volley, just as his countryman Henman did.As far as he has come over the last year, he knows he has still got a long way to go.“Listen, that episode in my life of being banned, it’s over,” Evans said. “Everyone forgave me as soon as I held my hands up and accepted the blame. But it’s not easy to be happy with yourself day in and day out when the fact is, I was No. 41 in the world and I threw it all away.”He added: “But to say that I’ve grown, that would be justifying it. There’s no sort of philosophical looking back on it. It was the worst thing ever. Now, I’m just back trying to win tennis matches.”"
"Board Meetings, Not Backhands, Are the Talk of Men’s Tennis - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Novak Djokovic played his first official tennis match in more than a month on Saturday night, defeating the American Bjorn Fratangelo in straight sets at the BNP Paribas Open.But Djokovic has hardly been taking an extended break from official tennis business.Back at No. 1 in the world by a hefty margin, he is also wielding his renewed clout off court as president of the ATP player council. As a result of his maneuvering, the men’s tour is in need of a new chief executive along with some collective purpose and peace of mind, which are likely to remain more elusive than Djokovic and his allies might like.As ever, the tension is between the players, who understandably want to maximize their earnings in a brutally competitive sport, and their paymasters, who own and operate the tournaments and understandably would rather keep prize money under tight rein. But the unusual and inconvenient thing in men’s tennis is that the players and paymasters are part of the same internally conflicted organization: the ATP.“We are really blocked,” said Gilles Simon, the French player and a former council member. “The structure works against us and the imbalance being already there between the tournaments and the players, the imbalance endures.”Acrimony is inevitable. Progress is not. Last week, Djokovic and the players appeared to send a strong message when the player representatives on the ATP Tour’s board of directors voted against extending the contract of Chris Kermode, the ATP’s executive chairman and president, who will now be obliged to step down at the end of 2019.But such a political power play is only intimidating if the players are truly united, which seems far from the case.The player council, in a nonbinding vote before the board meeting, could not reach agreement on whether to recommend or reject Kermode’s extension.In an age of constant communication, the biggest stars are somehow struggling to connect. Roger Federer, a former president of the player council, said Sunday that he had reached out to Djokovic before the vote only to be told that Djokovic could not squeeze him in.“That’s hard to understand for me,” Federer said.Rafael Nadal, a supporter of Kermode and continuity, said his cellphone was primed and ready, but no calls or texts came his way.This sounds more like high school than a global professional sport.“They are representing us, so normally they have to ask, what’s our opinion? Not in every small decision, but in big decisions,” Nadal said. “In my opinion, this one was a big decision.”The players and the tournaments each have three representatives on the ATP board of directors. The chairman — Kermode since 2014 — has the ability to cast a tiebreaking vote but would prefer to avoid it when possible for fear of endangering support from one side of the divide.It is a difficult dance even in the best of circumstances, and Kermode seems to have stepped on the wrong feet.Djokovic did not vote him out. That was up to the player representatives that he and the player council have supported or voted into place: David Egdes, a Tennis Channel executive; Alex Inglot, the director of communications at Sportradar; and Justin Gimelstob, the Tennis Channel commentator and former American player, who remains the most polarizing back-room figure in the sport and has remained in place despite facing felony battery charges.Under the ATP’s voting system, Kermode needed majority support (at least two votes) from each camp to continue. He received all three of the tournament representatives’ votes but apparently failed to get any of the player representatives’ votes.In a letter to ATP staff last week after his ouster, Kermode said it was “ironic” that he was leaving after “the players have achieved some of the greatest gains in the history of the ATP Tour in the past five years.”Kermode, a former low-level pro player and high-level tournament director, is a polished and genial Briton who knows how to work a room but apparently not every boardroom.Running the ATP Tour is a compromised position to begin with; the real power in tennis lies with the four Grand Slam tournaments, which function independently. Still, he navigated his position of weakness for more than five years, securing sponsorships and a hard-won prize money increase from the top tier of ATP tournaments.He also led the creation of new events like the Next Gen ATP Finals, designed to promote young players like 19-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov, who will eventually have to step out of the ink-black shadow cast by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.“From what I know of Chris, he was unbelievable,” Shapovalov said.But clearly not everyone is in the Kermode fan club.He is seen by some of the players as a “tournament guy,” a characterization he rejects. Others grumble about his handling of the ATP Cup, which will be relaunched in the opening week of the 2020 season in Australia.With the new-look Davis Cup using a similar format, Kermode tried to avoid a team-event glut by working toward a combined event. But he was overruled last year by the players.There is also criticism that he did not secure more prize money gains, above all from the four Grand Slam events. As council president, Federer once spearheaded a successful push for major increases, but with Grand Slam revenues growing, the concern is that prize money has not kept pace.Federer and Nadal could re-enter the fray. They talked tennis governance over coffee at Federer’s rented house here last week. But for now, it is the 31-year-old Djokovic’s turn to lead on court and off. He is multitasking at a point in his career when family time is ever more important to him and when he is again on the verge of holding all four of the Grand Slam singles titles.Why bother with tennis politics at this stage?, I asked him.“I tend to ask that myself, as well,” he said with a grin. “But I feel that it is my responsibility, in a way, as a top player to contribute to the sport in that way, as well.”Even if he charts a steadier course in the months to come, putting a more “player friendly” ATP chief in place looks all but impossible with the tournament representatives effectively possessing veto power on the board.Changing the governance structure, as Djokovic has suggested, sounds nearly as tricky.Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia and a driving force in the Australian Open’s growth, would be a strong ATP leader and has been interested in the chief executive post in the past.But with mutual trust at low ebb and no player union in sight, it is likely a compromise candidate will take over.Sure, tennis needs change and fresh ideas. But when you tear down a building, it seems best to have a clear idea what will stand in its place."
"Down and Out of Tennis at 22. Back at 28. - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — For the first point she played at a Grand Slam event in six years, Rebecca Marino hit an ace.She celebrated with a subtle fist pump, determined to have the best next act she could after a lengthy intermission during which she became the face of depression among athletes.“It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, just going from tournament to tournament now,” Marino said. “But if I stop and think about it, then that’s when I see that it’s pretty cool that I was able to do this, and to get this far, from no ranking to suddenly in the qualies of a Slam.”Marino lost, 6-2, 6-2, to Caroline Dolehide on Tuesday in the first round of Australian Open qualifying, limited by a back injury, which curtailed her off-season training. Despite her stiffness, Marino, 28, showed flashes of the power and clean ball-striking that sent her into the upper echelons of tennis seven years ago.With a percussive forehand and a booming serve that topped out at 120 miles per hour, Marino surged to a high of 38th in the rankings in the summer of 2011, when she was 20. Not a highly touted junior prospect, she had planned to enroll in college before her tennis successes mounted, catapulting her faster and further than she was prepared to handle.“Not expecting it, I felt like I was thrown into this machine, and I didn’t understand how it worked,” she said.Marino stepped back from the sport for the first time in 2012, taking seven months off. After returning for several months, she retired in February 2013 at age 22.In a conference call announcing her decision, Marino revealed her struggles with depression; days earlier, she had discussed her social media abuse in an interview with The New York Times. Her leaving the sport was often attributed to one of those factors, or both of them, which Marino said was inaccurate in retrospect.“When I look back, I wouldn’t necessarily say it was depression,” she said of her decision to stop playing. “It was burnout, and it was expectations put on my shoulders by myself and others, and I just wasn’t able to cope. It kind of all came to a head in a big, giant burnout, I guess.”Though her absence was longer than most, Marino is not the only player to have stepped away from the sport because of burnout. Most notably, the top Australian Ash Barty took off nearly two years early in her career. Barty has become a top player in her return, and she defeated No. 1 Simona Halep in Sydney this week.For Marino, stepping away from tennis made her “able to become superhappy and enjoy my life,” she said. Marino’s retirement at 22 generated considerable attention, particularly in her native Canada, where she was one of the brightest tennis prospects in generations. Her story resonated with others, but she felt uneasy being a touchstone for athletes struggling with depression. “It wasn’t something I was prepared for, and it’s still something I’m kind of grappling with,” Marino said. “I’m still a really private person, and so for people to come up to me and tell me all of the things they’ve dealt with, or how I’ve affected them, it’s difficult sometimes, because I don’t really know what to say. Even though I’m happy that I’ve helped people, it can be overwhelming because I’m not professionally trained to help people.”After retiring from tennis, Marino worked one summer for her family’s construction business, pouring cement and digging through clay. She later began teaching tennis lessons and enrolled at the University of British Columbia, where she studied English literature. The works she enjoyed most, she said, were ones from the Victorian era that grappled with the effects of industrialization on society.In her second year, the university’s rowing coach recruited her to join the team, knowing her athletic background and her family’s extensive history in the sport. (Her uncle George Hungerford was an Olympic gold medalist in 1964.) Rowing improved Marino’s fitness and helped expand her sense of identity.“To have a competitive outlet through a team like that was superfun,” she said. “It made me feel like I was a part of the university community. People didn’t look at me for my tennis anymore; they just looked at me as a student-athlete.”Marino was shaken in February 2017 when her father, Joe, received a prostate cancer diagnosis.“After he finished chemo, I kind of took a step back and wanted to look at what was important in my life,” she said. “I didn’t want to live with any regrets, and I thought that tennis was the one thing in my life that I kind of wish I had a do-over for.”She also wanted her father to see her play again. Marino weighed the idea of a return for months and gained confidence after serving as a hitting partner at a tournament in Vancouver, her hometown, in August 2017. A week before her next semester was to begin, Marino pulled out of her classes, quit her coaching job and moved to Montreal to begin working toward a full-fledged comeback at Tennis Canada’s training center.After a false start because she did not re-enter tennis’s antidoping program in time, Marino returned to the sport at its lowest rung last January, at a series of small tournaments in Turkey. She won her first 19 matches, including her first 30 sets. She worked throughout the year to bring her ranking to its current spot of 216th, which was enough to reach her goal of entering the Australian Open qualifying draw.Marino plans a long stay in the sport this time, and is working to ensure it is more pleasant and sustainable. She stays in better contact with friends, including more trips home to Vancouver, to help her keep one foot outside the sometimes suffocating tennis bubble.“My friends don’t play tennis, so they don’t care if I win or lose,” she said. “They’re just concerned about how I’m doing as a person, if I’m enjoying myself, and when I’ll be back so we can hang out. My whole structure this time around is a little bit different, and I have a lot of things outside of tennis that keep me grounded.”She added: “Previously, I felt like my identity was just ‘tennis player.’ But now I have many things that form my identity, and I feel like I’m very whole and very balanced.”Marino hopes her triumphs off and on the court gain the same amount of attention as her rough times did. She wants people to see her as a real person instead of a headline.“I have no doubts in my mind that I’m able to compete and be here,” Marino said. “I’m not going to ever go back to that place again because I know who I am now, and I know what I need to do.”"
"Bianca Andreescu Is Rising in the Tennis Rankings Ahead of Schedule - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Ranked No. 178 at the end of last season, the Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu set an ambitious goal for herself, it seemed: Climb high enough in the rankings to be able to get into the main draw of this year’s second Grand Slam event, the French Open, in May.Time for a new goal.“So quickly, like everything is happening so quickly!” she exclaimed late Friday evening as she sat for an interview as a surprise finalist in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.Her run here at age 18 as an unseeded wild card has been a revelation, featuring a 6-0, 6-1 demolition of the former No. 1 Garbiñe Muguruza in the quarterfinals and a grueling 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory over sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina in the semifinals on Friday.Now ranked 60th, she is the first wild card to reach the final of this top-tier women’s tournament, going one round further than Martina Hingis in 2006 and Serena Williams in 2015.That is pretty fair tennis company.“Thoughts? So many thoughts,” she said, putting both hands to her head. “Another goal of mine was to make history, and I just did. It’s incredible.”Tennis remains a brutally competitive individual sport, in which health, confidence and emotional balance can prove precarious, particularly when a young star emerges in a hurry.For now, Andreescu has won just one round in a Grand Slam singles tournament, when she qualified for this year’s Australian Open after a surprise run to the final in Auckland. But her breakthrough this season does not look like a fluke. She has the varied all-court game and precise, athletic footwork to give purists goose bumps. And her fighting spirit and open personality should speak to a wider audience, too.“She is playing with a combination of freedom and fearless determination; I hope she can hold on to this,” said Sven Groeneveld, the experienced Dutch coach who has helped Mary Pierce, Ana Ivanovic and, most recently, Maria Sharapova win major titles.The next hurdle for Andreescu is a big one: eighth-seeded Angelique Kerber, a former No. 1 and three-time Grand Slam singles champion, in Sunday’s final.“In the third set against Svitolina, I told myself, ‘I’m going to stick to my tactics and just go for it,’” Andreescu said. “So that’s what I did, and that’s what I’ve been doing for the last couple of months. This is my first time actually on the tour playing against such high-level athletes, so I really have nothing to lose, and in the final as well I have nothing to lose. I’m just going to go out there and believe in myself because anything is possible.”Andreescu, born to Romanian parents in the Toronto suburb Mississauga, is part of a new wave of gifted Canadian teenagers with flashy games, immigrant families and potential Grand Slam titles in their future.It includes Denis Shapovalov, the 19-year-old with the leaping, one-handed backhand who is ranked No. 25 in the men’s game, and Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, who turned heads here in Indian Wells by upsetting 10th-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round.This comes after the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard broke into the top five at age 20 after a phenomenal 2014, including a run to the Wimbledon final. But Bouchard fell back quickly and is ranked 73rd at age 25. Though she has shown signs of resurgence, she is also a cautionary tale after struggling to manage new expectations, albeit with a more limited tennis skill set than Andreescu’s.Keeping Andreescu grounded as her prospects soar is her team’s goal, and her own goal, too.“It’s easy to get distracted,” said her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, the head of women’s tennis at Tennis Canada. “But it’s going to be part of my work to make sure she stays in the moment.”Andreescu does her part by spending 15 minutes each morning doing what she calls “creative visualization”: imagining herself experiencing the situations she will face on court and off so she will be better equipped to manage them if and when they come. Many elite athletes rely on visualization, including the world’s best women’s Alpine skier, Mikaela Shiffrin.“I used to do hours and hours of it, but I found that 15 minutes has really helped me, and it’s not time-consuming at all,” Andreescu said. “It’s something I got online from a course. My mom introduced it to me when I was 13, and I have been doing it ever since.”Andreescu’s parents moved to Canada in 1994. Her mother, Maria, has a master’s degree in economics; her father, Nicu, is a mechanical engineer.“We arrived in Canada with two suitcases, and that’s all,” Nicu Andreescu told The Globe and Mail. “We had a great first impression when we arrived, having come from a former communist country. We wanted to go to Canada and start a new life and have a better future for any kids we might have.”Bianca is their only child, and though she developed her game under the umbrella of Tennis Canada, the sport’s governing body there, she said she took her first tennis lesson at age 7 in Romania, where her mother had moved back temporarily for a business opportunity.That lesson was on clay (bring on Roland Garros), and though her family was soon reunited in Canada, Andreescu has retained strong ties to Romania. Simona Halep, the Romanian star, was one of her two main tennis role models along with Kim Clijsters.Andreescu speaks Romanian with her parents and attributes her combativeness on court to her “Romanian roots.”“I think we are very passionate, and we leave it all out there,” she said. “It’s all heart.”She has shown plenty of grit in Indian Wells, rallying in the first round to beat the Romanian player Irina-Camelia Begu, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3, on the tournament’s second biggest show court.“I actually thought I was going to lose,” she said. “I was really nervous.”She experienced back pain in that match, which has been a recurring problem and was still troubling her late Friday night as she repeatedly shifted position in her chair during an interview after the duel with Svitolina.“I have a lot of weakness in my core, so that’s definitely something I’m improving on,” said Andreescu, who has also missed significant court time with a stress fracture in her foot.On Friday against Svitolina, she had to fight through leg cramps in the final set, in which she managed to convert her fourth match point — mixing drop shots with big, bold groundstrokes as she constructed points down the stretch.Though tennis stars are trending taller, Andreescu is 5-foot-7. But she has powerful legs that help her generate tremendous pace when she needs it with both her midcourt forehand and her two-handed backhand and to leap high off the ground when serving. Her second serve, unlike for many players of her size, is not a weakness.Though she has abundant power and world-class mobility, what separates her from the pack is her ability to change pace. She can lob and generate acute angles with off-speed groundstrokes. She looks comfortable attacking the net and has a solid overhead, which she had to prove repeatedly against Svitolina, a premier defender.Andreescu fearlessly uses the whole canvas.“I love that,” she said of the description. “No one has ever said that about my game before, but that definitely describes it, I think. I like to hit every shot in the book.”She is now 2-0 against top-10 players after upsetting Caroline Wozniacki in January in Auckland, where she also defeated Venus Williams.The victory over Williams moved her to tears. “Venus is a walking, living, breathing legend,” Andreescu said.But though the emotions were powerful again on Friday night, beating her tour elders is fast becoming a habit. Andreescu will be ranked in the top 35 on Monday and will break into the top 25 if she defeats Kerber. Instead of merely making it into the French Open draw, she now has a fine chance of being seeded.“I do believe that I deserve to be here,” she said sotto voce as the interview ended. “But I didn’t expect for it to come so quickly. But I mean, it’s better sooner than later, right? So I can’t complain. It’s just been crazy. I’m so grateful. I never want to take anything for granted. It was so nice to meet you.”"
"In Women’s Tennis, Finesse Can Fight Power - The New York Times
Another season of Grand Slam tennis begins at the Australian Open on Monday, but Agnieszka Radwanska, who retired in November, won’t be part of it.Aptly called “The Ninja” for her ability to inflict out-of-nowhere pain on the opposition from all manner of contortionist positions, Radwanska’s spectacular, poker-faced shotmaking will be missed.But even without its Ninja, the women’s game is in a memorable phase when it comes to entertainment value and players with an uncommon touch.At the moment and probably not for long, the tour is a clash of generations with Serena Williams, 37, and Venus Williams, 38, still in the mix along with midcareer champions like Angelique Kerber, 30, and Caroline Wozniacki, 28, and the new wave led by Naomi Osaka, 21, the Japanese sensation who upset Serena Williams to win the United States Open last year. It is rare to see such a range of players clashing with the outcomes so uncertain.The tour has geographical breadth with players from the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia all in the top 20 and with Ons Jabeur, 24, of Tunisia in the top 60 after last year, becoming the first Arab woman to reach a WTA final.But there is another strong and too often undervalued selling point: stylistic variety. Though serious baseline power remains the most popular and fail-safe route to stardom, players with subtler, more creative games are also finding a way to win consistently, just as Radwanska, a former world No. 2 and Wimbledon finalist, did before her injuries.Several of these tennis “artists” will be seeded at the Australian Open: No. 10 Daria Kasatkina of Russia, No. 13 Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia, No. 15 Ashleigh Barty of Australia, and No. 28 Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan, a 33-year-old whose double-handed, frequently off-speed strokes are as crafty as they come. There is also Jabeur, still an outsider but whose game is a crowd-pleasing mix of baseline punch, feathery touch and Federer-esque flourishes.“There will always be exceptions to the power players,” said Paul McNamee, the former Australian men’s star who advises Hsieh. “The players you refer to, however, all have one thing in common: exceptional hands. They have amazing touch, and this is why they can survive even if they have less raw power.”That hardly means they have none. Barty, despite being 5-foot-5 and shorter than most of her rivals, generates the leg drive and racket-head speed to hit big serves and forehands. Her crisply sliced backhand has unusual bite, and she has perhaps the best net game in the sport.“The plan to get to the net more often is a focus for 2019,” said Craig Tyzzer, her coach. “Ash certainly benefits from playing more doubles than most of the other singles girls, but her volley skills were certainly developed from an early age, which is a massive advantage.”Kasatkina has a heavy topspin forehand that she can flatten out to create more pace when she requires it.But what distinguishes the members of the WTA’s creative class from their peers is the size of their tool set and the range of their tactical options. Their success has meant more matchups that feature contrasting styles: important to the appeal of a game where patterns have a tendency to repeat.“Tennis is a game of chess, of tactics,” said Philippe Dehaes, Kasatkina’s coach, who has emerged as one of the tour’s leading mentors and motivators. “You have to vary zones and trajectories and find the answer suited to what your opponent is doing. To have women who play well tactically and who can keep the ball in play, while varying and creating, makes the show much more interesting for people, in my opinion.”It is not the contrast that tennis once regularly offered. When Martina Navratilova was attacking the net in the 1970s and 1980s against her baseline-hugging archrival Chris Evert and others, the gulf between styles and tennis philosophies was much wider.“When you had serve-and-volleyers going against baseliners, that was more of a complete and obvious contrast,” said Tracy Austin, the precocious champion who faced Navratilova frequently. “But in this day and age where the game has become homogenized, we’re looking for any contrast. It’s not as extreme as it used to be, but that’s why Hsieh Su-wei is fun to watch, because you feel like you can see the wheels turning in her mind as to where to place the ball, the geometry of the court. So many players use left and right, and she uses north and south as well.”Hsieh is constantly changing depth: shifting her target from the backcourt to the forecourt as she mixes in drop shots, angled volleys and sliced and flat groundstrokes.“Her hands can redirect a shot in either direction on both wings with pinpoint accuracy,” McNamee said. “That’s not normal.”But outlier fast-twitch defensive skills are required to thrive in an era of abundant power and athleticism, of taller, stronger opposition with superior leverage like Petra Kvitova, Garbine Muguruza, Karolina Pliskova, Madison Keys and the ascendant Aryna Sabalenka.“I try to do something else than the normal,” said Sevastova, a U.S. Open semifinalist last year whose trademark is the drop shot. “I think it’s important, and it’s my style. It’s not like I don’t have power. I just don’t have that much. But I can handle their pace and hit the ball quickly, and I like variety.”Dehaes sees more women being able to survive the onslaught.“I think that has always been the case, but in the last few years we saw it a bit less,” he said. “I think the equipment played a big role, and there was the evolution of women’s tennis with players becoming stronger physically and better technically. Because everyone trains a lot and everyone trains well, which was not always the case in former times. So with more athletic players and more high-performance equipment, the pace of the game accelerated. But I think now the girls are getting used to it and are more able to counter the games of these super-powerful players.”Tennis’s recent honor roll confirms that. Three of the four Grand Slam singles titles last year went to counterpunchers: the No. 1 player, Simona Halep, and Kerber and Wozniacki, all of whom have long had speed and defensive skills, but who also have focused on improving their serves and learning to embrace risk selectively.“Honestly, it could be just 15 percent more aggression that can make the difference,” Austin said. “You are just robbing your opponent of a little bit of time on certain shots.”Martin Blackman, general manager of player development at the United States Tennis Association, says he believes that “we will see more and more complete players on the women’s side.”Purer power players are also trying to broaden their range. In her late teens, Osaka clearly had potent groundstrokes and a penetrating serve. But she did not make the leap to Grand Slam champion until she lost weight in 2018 and improved her explosive movement, agility and defensive skills with help from her new coach, Sascha Bajin, and her fitness coach, Abdul Sillah.“She’s pulled back some; Sascha’s got her thinking more on the court rather than just see ball, hit ball,” Austin said. “Now, she’s fit enough and aware enough and realizes, ‘O.K., this is a red-light ball. I have to get the point back to neutral.’ Or ‘this is a green-light ball, and I can go big.’”The artists are also at work on finding the time to use their brushes.“My challenge with Dasha,” said Dehaes, using Kasatkina’s nickname, “is to help her find a way to stay in the rally even under great pressure, and at a certain moment, the right moment, make the difference with a variation. But it’s not easy to vary when you play someone like Sabalenka, who hits every ball very hard from everywhere without much theory. It’s very hard to counter this kind of woman.”Perhaps impossible when a true power player is on target.“If you have Serena and she’s at the top of her game, I still say that power is always going to win,” Austin said. “I don’t know if Sabalenka is 10 to 15 percent away from that top level or maybe just two weeks away, but when she’s all cylinders firing, I still think she’s going to take out the Kasatkinas, the Sevastovas, the Bartys. But let me tell you. If you’re off a little bit and your timing is messed up a little bit by those combinations — topspin, slice, short, deep — it’s a whole new ballgame.”"
"Another Source of Conflict in Tennis: Are You Up or Down on Doubles? - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — After bowing out of the Australian Open this week, Jack Sock and his childhood friend and doubles partner, Jackson Withrow, ended up on opposite sides of a great divide.Withrow’s childhood dream was to play professional tennis; doubles proved to be his only portal.Sock, the world’s second-ranked doubles player, has an Olympic gold medal from 2016 that he won in the mixed event, which led to his being honored at a University of Nebraska football game and throwing a ceremonial first pitch at a Kansas City Royals baseball game.In addition, he shares four Grand Slam titles, three in doubles and the other in mixed.Sock, 26, has also climbed as high as No. 8 in singles, which is where he stood last year at this time. His ranking since has tumbled to 105, but singles remains No. 1 in his heart.“I can personally say if I’m not relevant in the singles world and my only choice is to play doubles, I’d probably stop playing tennis,” Sock said.Doubles is supposed to be the harmonic expression of tennis, but at the Australian Open, the doubles court has become the receptacle for petty grievances and philosophical divergences. It started with Bernard Tomic accusing his countryman and Davis Cup captain, Lleyton Hewitt, of a litany of leadership failures, including writing himself into the lineup for Davis Cup.Then Dan Evans, the 189th-ranked singles player, fanned the flames in his native Britain by describing doubles players as athletes “who didn’t make it at singles and people who didn’t have the attitude to work hard enough to make it in the singles game.”Jamie Murray, ranked seventh in doubles, dismissed Evans’s comments as “lazy” and “just total nonsense” and said, “We should be celebrating any success we have in the sport — doubles, mixed doubles, wheelchairs, whatever.”The Australian Open is called the Happy Slam, but the crankiness quotient at this one has been high — as if everybody woke up on the wrong side of 2019. The men’s tour appears to be a house divided over the future of the ATP president and chief executive, Chris Kermode, who some believe should be removed from office. The women have complained that the men do not support gender equity. The men fell in line behind an exasperated Rafael Nadal, who said at a news conference, “I don’t know why you are trying all the time to create these kinds of stories on this thing.”On Wednesday, the tournament’s 10th day, there was harmony, at least in the stands of Rod Laver Arena. During a changeover in the Australian Samantha Stosur’s semifinal victory with Zhang Shuai against Barbora Strycova and Marketa Vondrousova, the Village People blared from the speakers and even the chair umpire got in the act of forming the letters in Y.M.C.A.By the tournament’s stretch run, all of Australia was celebrating doubles since the men’s, women’s, mixed and wheelchair finals included at least one native son or daughter. (An Australian hasn’t won a singles title here since 1978.) But no amount of success will sway Sock to embrace doubles exclusively.Sock, who played most of last year with Mike Bryan because Bryan’s twin, Bob, was nursing a hip injury, won two majors and about $1.3 million playing doubles and $738,747 while compiling a 9-21 record in singles. He finished 17th over all in ATP prize money despite ranking outside the top 100 in singles.“It’s not just singles that you can make a career from in tennis,” said Murray, who has six Grand Slam titles to his brother Andy’s three in singles. “It’s important for a lot of young kids to know that growing up. It’s not easy to make it in the tennis world. There are only a few people that can make a really good living from the game. The journey is incredibly long. However you get there, whether it’s singles or doubles or whatever, there’s options there for you.”With four career singles titles, including three in 2017, Sock would appear to have more options than most. But he doesn’t see it that way.Ryan Harrison, who teamed with Sam Querrey to beat Sock and Withrow in the round of 16 this week, said: “Jack doesn’t want to feel discredited for his singles ability because of his dominance in doubles. And a lot of time his success in doubles overshadows him as a top-10 singles player. He’s going, ‘I’ve been 8 in the world in singles, and people are talking about me like a doubles guy.’ That perception is always going to be difficult for him.”As long as the stigma persists that doubles players are lesser than singles players, the Socks of the sport are going to have a strong incentive to stick to singles. Harrison said he has tried to appeal to Sock’s vanity.“I’ve told him it’d give him more confidence in singles if he took more pride in literally being the most dominant doubles player,” Harrison said. “He feels like he’s being viewed as someone not capable of playing singles.”Mike Bryan said he hated to hear Sock would sooner leave the sport than stick to doubles.“When he gets out on the doubles court, he has a blast,” Bryan said. “And because of doubles, he’s played in some of the biggest stadiums in the world, he’s won a gold medal, he’s been honored at a Nebraska football game. What’s the harm in all of that?”"
"Stevie Johnson Still Carries His Grief Onto the Tennis Court - The New York Times
DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Before the start of every tennis match now, Stevie Johnson walks to the back of the court and squats down for a moment or two. Sometimes he says a little prayer. Often he gives himself an abbreviated pep talk.Almost always he thinks of doing things the way his father wanted him to.“I really just say a couple of words to myself to help me put everything in perspective,” said Johnson, 29, whose father, Steve, died of a heart attack at 58 nearly two years ago. “I tell myself to do things the right way and to treat people with respect. And I remind myself that tennis doesn’t define me.”Johnson has had a hard time keeping tennis, and life, in perspective since May 2017, when his mother reached him by phone just as he was about to board a plane to Rome for the Italian Open and told him that his father had failed to wake up that morning.Not only had his father taught Stevie how to play the game, he also sat in the stands for college matches at Southern California and for pro matches at Wimbledon and the United States Open. He witnessed his son’s first ATP pro titles in Nottingham, England, in 2016 and in Houston just weeks before his death.Entering the Delray Beach Open, which began on Feb. 16, Johnson had not won a match since squandering a two-sets-to-one lead against ninth-seeded Dominic Thiem in the second round of last year’s U.S. Open.Johnson had lost nine straight matches, including one against Borna Coric in the Americans’ Davis Cup semifinal loss to Croatia in September. He fell in the first round at last week’s New York Open to 154th-ranked Brayden Schnur, even though he served for the match and held two match points (Schnur was the eventual tournament runner-up). After that loss, Johnson was despondent in the locker room.When Johnson, seeded fourth in Delray, won his first match on Tuesday over a longtime friend and Southern California neighbor, 131st-ranked Jason Jung, he said, “I’m just glad to get the monkey off my back and not lose 10 straight.”He followed that with a win over Paolo Lorenzi of Italy on Thursday but then lost in the quarterfinals to 82nd-ranked Radu Albot of Moldova, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5). In that match, Johnson raced to a 5-0 lead in only 18 minutes, and then to a 6-1, 3-1 lead before Albot reeled off 12 of the next 15 points and five consecutive games. Johnson was two points from winning the match late in the third set, but Albot sneaked to the net for a backhand stab volley, and Johnson then hit a forehand wide on match point.“It’s embarrassing,” he said. “It’s frustrating. I was up a set and a break, and I got tight. Thought I was on a good path, and then this. That’s the way life’s been going for me these days.”Despite his five-month losing streak, Johnson’s ranking should stay near his current No. 34. He is the third-best American, behind No. 9 John Isner and No. 29 Frances Tiafoe, the defending Delray Beach champion, who lost in the first round here this year.Losing has been a bitter pill, especially because he came so close to upsetting Thiem. But a rolled ankle midway through the second set contributed to the 3-hour-34-minute loss.“I probably shouldn’t have even played after the U.S. Open,” Johnson said. “I just didn’t have any tennis left in me. Just all the traveling, from New York to L.A. to Croatia, back to L.A., then Asia and Europe. The way the schedule is, you feel like you need to play all the time, and I got into that trap. But that’s what you have to do when you play tennis; you have to earn it.“I’m not an N.F.L. player who signs a lucrative four-year deal and then can take five months off, have a bad slump and then turn it around. Every week you have to prove yourself. If you have a bad six months, you can go from No. 8 in the world to No. 78, or worse.”Johnson has been transparent about how difficult life has been since his father’s death. He often looks to his players’ box, only to see a glaring vacuum where his father used to sit. There are days when he still can’t bring himself to leave the house.After a third-round loss to the eventual runner-up Marin Cilic at Wimbledon in 2017, he was so physically and emotionally spent that he developed a fever that lingered and landed him in the hospital. And after a three-set loss in the first round of the 2018 New York Open, he felt as if the ground was spinning, and he experienced shortness of breath that was attributed to anxiety.That experience led Johnson to seek advice from Mardy Fish, a former top-10 player whose career was marked by bouts of anxiety. At the urging of his mother, Michelle, Johnson also sought help from a psychologist, someone he continues to see whenever he is home in Redondo Beach, Calif.“Stevie’s mom has been instrumental to him,” said Johnson’s wife, Kendall, a former U.S.C. volleyball player who has been with him for almost seven years. “She’s paved the way with her own recovery and helps him put things into perspective. Even through his grieving, Stevie knows his father wouldn’t want him to struggle and that he would want him to keep playing.”Craig Boynton, who has coached Johnson through much of his professional career, said he understood the danger of being sucked down a losing-run rabbit hole.“The funny thing about streaks is that when they snowball the right way, you stop thinking and have great clarity in your execution of your shots,” Boynton said. “But when the streak is going the wrong way, there’s a tendency to overthink and doubt yourself. That takes away your focus from your execution. There’s no flow, and it creates drought or a rut, and that’s what Stevie’s been going through. One match can change things in either direction.”After two wins in Delray Beach, there was finally a greater hop in Johnson’s step. But it does not mean he no longer has dark thoughts, no longer wonders whether he should even continue to play tennis.“Some days it’s easy to fight through and enjoy it,” Johnson said. “But those hard days have been outweighing the good days at the moment.”“It’s hard to fake the passion,” he added, choking on his words and using a towel to wipe away tears. “I mean, my father was such a big part of my tennis life. Tennis is just a weird dynamic for me right now. Every day is different. I mean, he should still be here watching me.”"
"Tennis: Keys Tops Stephens to Reach Semis in Charleston - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Madison Keys overcame some uncharacteristically poor serving and elevated her game late on to edge fellow American Sloane Stephens 7-6(6) 4-6 6-2 and advance to the semi-finals of the Charleston Open on Friday. Both players struggled with their serves in a match that included 13 breaks but it was Keys who was able to cut down on the errors and step up the intensity in the third set, which she won when Stephens sent a backhand long.The match on the green clay also featured a seesaw first set tie-breaker in which Keys jumped out to a 4-0 lead before Stephens stormed back with six straight points. Stephens failed to convert either of the two set points she had on her serve and Keys unleashed a blistering cross court forehand winner to capture the hour-long first set.""It's always tough to play a friend and it kind of shows at times like that,"" Keys said of the wild first set tie-breaker. ""It was up and it was down and it was just kind of crazy."" The win was a first for Keys over Stephens, who came out on top in their semi-final match up at last year's French Open and in the 2017 U.S. Open final. Next up for Keys is Puerto Rican Monica Puig, who crushed 29 winners to topple American Danielle Collins in their quarter-final to end the day. The 25-year-old Olympic gold medalist from San Juan fired down six aces to book her first semi-final trip since the Connecticut Open in August. Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki looked like she had fully recovered from the illness that sidelined her for two months earlier this year, playing nearly perfect tennis to down Maria Sakkari 6-2 6-2. Wozniacki, the 2011 champion in Charleston, smacked 15 winners to just eight unforced errors and looked particularly sharp returning serve, where she moved briskly and attacked Sakkari's second serves.The only hiccup came in the match's 16-minute final game, where Wozniacki needed five match points before she was able to break the young Greek's service again to win the tie. The fifth-seeded Dane will be a heavy favorite in her semi-final showdown on Saturday against Petra Martic, who upset Belinda Bencic 6-3 6-4 in the morning match. Wozniacki has never dropped a set to the Croatian in five career meetings.  (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)"
"Winning Tennis Titles Again, Bob Bryan Is Inspiring Athletes With Hip Injuries - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — At 40, Bob Bryan can dive for volleys again. He can turn, twist and slap fast-twitch returns. He can also win more titles: He partnered with his twin brother, Mike, and triumphed at the Delray Beach Open and the Miami Open in the last six weeks.It is all beginning to feel so familiar that Bob Bryan, one of the greatest doubles players in history, often forgets that he now has a mostly metal right hip.“When I take the towel off, and I walk by a mirror, I go: ‘Whoa! Look at that scar!’” he said. “I have a 10-inch scar, and without that scar, I wouldn’t even know it’s in there.”Tennis has long produced first-rate comeback tales. It has been 30 years since Thomas Muster, the intense Austrian, whacked groundstrokes in a custom-designed chair designed to protect his postoperative left knee, which was injured when a drunken driver plowed into Muster’s parked vehicle at the tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla.Muster returned to the tour and reached No. 1.Bryan’s renaissance at an age when most tennis stars have long since retired is certainly one for the short list, too.It has been less than a year since he was hobbling down the boardwalk in Santa Cruz, Calif., with his wife, Michelle, certain that his remarkable career was over. He was concerned, above all, about getting healthy enough to play with his three young children.“I couldn’t walk for more than five minutes,” he said.The orthopedic surgeon Edwin Su resurfaced Bryan’s hip on Aug. 2 at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and explained that, if all went very well, Bryan could envision returning to tournament play eight months later.He returned to action in five months and, now at the eight-month mark, is winning significant tournaments.“What Bob is doing is incredible,” Su said in a telephone interview on Monday. “He really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implant.”“Incredible” is quite a word choice from a surgeon who has performed more than 4,000 such procedures. A few others were on professional athletes trying to save their careers, including the former major league pitcher Colby Lewis.But no professional tennis player has had this procedure and returned to the fore, although Andy Murray, who underwent the same type of operation in January in London after plenty of chatting and texting with Bryan, may try to do the same.“The things that make Bob Bryan great, you don’t know if you are going to lose that with an artificial joint and surgery,” Su said. “It’s amazing to see he doesn’t seem to have lost any of it and in fact is now able to play without pain.”David Macpherson, the Bryans’ longtime coach, said Bob was playing like the “30-year-old Bob.”“He’s exploding to poaches like the old days when he would just steal points from incredible cross-court returns by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking off balls,” Macpherson said in Miami. “I also feel he’s a little more confident on the return, letting it go and doing more damage than before, and he is still serving just as nasty. So I really feel he’s in a great place right now, where he’s just enjoying his life and loves his family but is getting a second lease on tennis.”After Bob’s hip problem became acute in Madrid last May, Mike went on to win Wimbledon and the United States Open with Jack Sock. Bob attended their practices in New York while using a cane. But there was no doubt the twins would reunite on court if Bob could recover.“With all the success Mike was having with Jack in the majors, Bob just handled it all with so much class and was so supportive of Mike in that time,” MacPherson said.Doubles has been deeply overshadowed in the modern era, with the biggest stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal focusing on singles in Grand Slam tournaments. But in a parched environment, the Bryans — Mike the right-hander, and Bob the lefty — have managed to carve out a rich niche with their winning ways and personalities.They have enthusiastically gone above and beyond to sign just about every autograph and pose for just about every selfie, but Bob is reaching a new audience now.“I talk to probably three or four people a week, people who get my number and call me about hip problems,” he said. “A professional soccer player in Australia. I’m getting hit up by people all the time.”He said he had spoken with Murray, the former world No. 1 from Britain, most recently about a week ago.“He was asking me a lot of questions in the early weeks, because obviously those are the weeks where you are not feeling great and probably a little concerned,” Bryan said. “But I think he’s probably feeling really good right now.”Murray has posted video of himself on social media lightly hitting tennis balls. But returning in singles, with full-court coverage required, is a more daunting prospect.“I think a three-out-of-five-set singles match is almost close to 50 times more physical than doubles,” Bryan said. “It’s going to really challenge Andy, the movement. But I can jump. I can lunge, and I am not sore after matches.”As Murray debated whether to have surgery, Bryan put him in touch with Su, who said Murray was an ideal candidate for the procedure. Murray ultimately chose to have it done closer to home by Sarah Muirhead-Allwood, a leading British hip surgeon..Can he come back and play singles at the highest level?“I think he would be able to,” Su said.Hip resurfacing is not a total hip replacement. It calls for shaving a thin layer of damaged bone off the ball of the hip joint and replacing it with a metal cap — “like crowning a tooth,” Su said.A metal socket is also put in place. “When Bob refers to it as his metal hip, it is truly metal,” Su said.Bryan credited Su, an avid tennis player, for his success so far.“People tell me this surgery comes down to millimeters,” Bryan said. “I’ve talked to people who had different doctors and have done the same procedure, and they feel like crap.”Su said he believed Bryan’s recovery had been accelerated in part by the use of a relatively new rehabilitation tool: an anti-gravity treadmill, which supports a player at the hips with an inflatable lower-body compartment and reduces the risks of fractures in the recovery phase.“You can un-weight the body to 60 percent to 70 or 80,” Su said.Su saw Bryan compete in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., last month.“I love it, just to see what he’s able to do,” Su said. “I cringe a little bit when he dives, but he’s done it several times, and no worse for the wear.”Will such acrobatics and the other rigors of professional tennis put Bryan at greater risk of requiring follow-up surgery down the road?“That’s a really good question we don’t have the answer to,” Su said. “We don’t have enough data in terms of how it would hold up to activity such as this. This has been done now for almost two decades, so there are some very active patients out there, and activity doesn’t seem to make it wear out. We’re drawing from the experiences of recreational athletes.”The Miami title was the Bryans’ 118th together on tour. They had once planned on retiring after the 2012 Olympics and were close to retirement at the 2017 Australian Open. But such plans are on hold, even with their 41st birthday looming on April 29.“Now we’re looking at Tokyo in 2020,” Bob said of the next Olympics, while emphasizing that “we never wanted to play until we were 45 or 46.”Skepticism is definitely permitted at this stage.“I know,” Bob said with a chuckle. “My wife doesn’t believe me, either.”"
"Second Slam Title Signals Naomi Osaka Has the Power to Rule Tennis - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — In a riveting Australian Open women’s final on Saturday, Petra Kvitova tried unsuccessfully to shake Naomi Osaka. Kvitova earned five break points in the first set, which she could not convert, and saved three championship points in the second, which she ultimately was unable to capitalize on.Osaka refused to fade away. Later, as the Rod Laver Arena crowd celebrated Osaka’s 7-6 (2), 5-7, 6-4 victory, Kvitova looked around to congratulate her opponent — and couldn’t find her anywhere.“Well done, Naomi,” Kvitova said, craning her neck to look behind her. “Where are you?”Every little thing Osaka does on the court inexorably draws the eye to her, but take the racket out of her hand and she visibly shrinks from the spotlight. Born in Japan and raised in the United States by a Japanese mother and a Haitian father, she was asked in an interview on Australian television if she was ready to become the face of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.“Yikes,” she said, wincing. “Hopefully for their sake they don’t do that.”How can they not?Osaka came into this tournament last year ranked No. 72. When the new world rankings come out on Monday, Osaka, 21, the reigning United States Open champion, will become the first singles player, male or female, from Japan to reach No. 1. The retired Chinese star Li Na might as well have been passing a torch when she presented Osaka with the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup in the on-court trophy presentation.Li, a two-time major winner, rose to No. 2, behind Serena Williams, shortly after winning the 2014 Australian Open. For five years, no singles player from Asia had climbed higher.Osaka, the first woman since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to win her first two major titles back to back, does not appear to be going anywhere but forward.When Osaka defeated Williams in the U.S. Open final in September, she was the eighth different woman since the 2017 Australian Open to win a Grand Slam title. By consolidating her victory in New York with her performance in Melbourne, Osaka demonstrated that she has staying power.Osaka’s victory over Williams, in retrospect, seems to have represented a coronation of sorts, one queen ceding the throne to her successor. That idea got lost in that final’s chaotic finish, when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, warned Williams about a coaching infraction, setting off a chain of events that thrust Williams into the spotlight and Osaka into the shadows.“Definitely she is a great one,” Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, said of Osaka. “We’ll see what the future will bring. But for sure she has probably everything that has to be there to play her best tennis.”Kvitova, 28, was the same age that Osaka is now in 2011 when she won her first Wimbledon title. It took her three years to return to a Grand Slam final, and she took the title again at Wimbledon in 2014.“I probably wasn’t really ready to win it, to be honest,” said Kvitova, who spoke of struggling to adjust to increased expectations — and not just from the public.“You’re thinking like you have to win every single match because you just won a Grand Slam,” she said, adding, “I put a bit more pressure than I should.”Osaka also expects a lot of herself. It is what drove her in the past year to create more spin on her forehand, which produced eight winners in the deciding set on Saturday. She has also worked on the placement, and not just the pace, of her serve, also to great effect; she recorded nine aces in the final to finish the tournament with 59, which was 22 more than the next-highest woman.And against Kvitova, Osaka was able to corral her emotions after the second set got away from her, which hasn’t always been her strong suit. She lost in the semifinals of a tuneup event in Brisbane after she worked herself into a fury because she felt it was a match that no major champion should lose.Rain was in the air in Melbourne Park — a few drops fell late in the third set, prompting the roof to be closed for the end of the match. But Osaka can create her own weather system, and the storm clouds were gathering between her ears in the second set as Kvitova became more aggressive with her groundstrokes and pushed Osaka deeper behind the baseline.As the second set wore on, Osaka rubbed her temples, glowered at her racket and, at one point, turned her back on Kvitova and took deep breaths, trying to gather herself. After losing the last four games, Osaka took a bathroom break to regroup before the deciding set, and left the court in tears.While she was gone, Osaka said, she reminded herself that Kvitova was an excellent player. She told herself she had to expect a hard-fought battle, especially after the long and winding path Kvitova had traveled to get to the final, her first since she sustained a career-threatening injury while fighting off a knife-wielding burglar in her Czech Republic apartment in late 2016.“I can’t really act entitled,” Osaka said. “To be playing against one of the best players in the world, to lose a set, suddenly think that I’m so much better than her, that isn’t a possibility.”Osaka’s pep talk to herself was effective. In the third game of the third set, she broke Kvitova. “I literally just tried to turn off my feelings,” Osaka said.She has won 60 consecutive matches in which she has taken the first set, but don’t ask her to explain how she does it. Talking is not one of her talents, Osaka said. “Like in my day-to-day I might speak like 10 sentences,” she said.Osaka grimaced through the trophy presentation, which she was able to laugh about afterward. “I forgot to smile,” she said. “I was told to smile and I didn’t. I was panicking.”Osaka forgot a lot of the reminders she had written down on a sheet of paper — just in case she won and had to deliver a speech. Osaka is shy but thoughtful; reserved but disarmingly revealing.Describing the third set, she said, “I just felt kind of hollow, like I was a robot, sort of. I was just executing my orders, like I just did what I’ve been practicing my whole life.”"
"Tennis: Hopman Cup Ends After Three Decades as Perth Made ATP Cup Host - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Perth has been chosen as the third city to host the inaugural ATP Cup in January 2020, signaling an end to the Hopman Cup international mixed team event that has been hosted by the Western Australian city for the past 31 years.Sydney and Brisbane were announced as the other ATP Cup host cities in January, with Sydney hosting the knockout rounds and final.""The ATP Cup will launch the global tennis season for the men,"" Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley said at the Perth Arena on Thursday.""Four of the top 12 male players, and eight of the top 24, will play in Perth, with 24 teams competing across three cities -- Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.""The ATP Cup will have 750 ranking points and $22 million in prize money up for grabs.The event leaves no room in the revamped tennis calendar for the Hopman Cup, which is popular with players and has traditionally served as a warm-up for the Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam.Paul McNamee, founder of the Hopman Cup and a four-time doubles Grand Slam champion, said he did not know if the tournament would move to another city.""My immediate feeling is sadness that it's not going to be there anymore and concern about where the Hopman Cup may be in the future,"" he told ABC News.The International Tennis Federation (ITF) which runs the Hopman Cup said it was ""committed"" to continuing to stage the event and had begun searching for a new tournament partner.""The ITF is committed to upholding the core values of the Hopman Cup in the future and are encouraged by the interest that has already been expressed,"" ITF President David Haggerty said in a statement.""We are in discussions with potential partners to decide where and when this tournament will be next hosted.

"A Male Tennis Pro, a Female Coach and Shrugs for Anyone Who Thinks It Won’t Work - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Lucas Pouille, the brightest young star in men’s tennis in France, was flickering.Pouille, 24, reached a career-high ranking of No. 10 in March, but did not win more than two matches consecutively after that, finishing the year with a 14-17 run. Playing without inspiration or belief, he slipped to No. 32 by the end of the season.“I lost confidence, and then I was not enjoying so much being on court, being on tour,” he said. “I didn’t really want to play tennis.”He had to find a solution, he said. “I had to find my joy of being on court.”Pouille split with Emmanuel Planque, his coach of six years, in November. Pouille, who had yearned to take a break from the tour but decided to finish the season so he could play in the Davis Cup final, was on his own for eight days. When he did pick up a racket, it was only to play minitennis with friends.But on the Monday after the Davis Cup final, which France lost to Croatia, he met with his team’s captain-in-waiting, Amélie Mauresmo.Pouille had another offer: Coach him instead.“When we were talking to each other, it was this couple hours of talking that really had me thinking,” Mauresmo said. “He had me thinking that he’s ambitious, that he wants to do everything in order to be as good as possible. He kind of convinced me with what he was saying, that he was ready to do all the efforts and the hard work that are going with being at the top, with digging deep to be at your best.”Stepping away from the Davis Cup position before she even started was not an easy decision for Mauresmo, especially considering the excitement over her appointment as the country’s first female captain. But it was made easier, she said, by the radical changes coming to the competition this season, which will reduce the final rounds to a World Cup-style format played at one site, with three matches of best-of-three sets in each pairing, instead of five matches in a best-of-five format.“I think the captain’s role will be really reduced,” Mauresmo, 39, said. “What was interesting for me was all the weeks of preparations, the three days of competition, the best-of-five, building a team throughout a year, and the home-and-away. For me, I grew up watching that. I grew up having the emotions that go with it.”“So I have no doubt that it will be a good show, a good competition for the crowd, and they will probably put on a big show or whatever. But as a captain, I didn’t feel that the role was that important.”Pouille said he was encouraged by the belief Mauresmo showed in him when she left such a high-profile opportunity behind.“That’s what I wanted to have with me: someone who believes in me, and who believes we can go very far together,” Pouille said. “I’m very happy that she’s part of it now, and we can work together, we can have the best results possible.”Pouille is the only man in the ATP Tour’s top 100 currently coached by a woman outside his immediate family, but he said Mauresmo’s gender was not a consideration in his decision to hire her.“For me, it doesn’t matter if it’s a man, woman, grandfather, grandmother — I don’t care,” he said. “As long as they know what they’re talking about. In women’s sports or men’s sports, in the end you’re dealing with the same stuff on the court.“Mentally, it’s the same stuff. Technically, she knows tennis. She knows what I need to do on the court to be better. For me, that’s what is important.”Pouille’s choice of Mauresmo was the second high-profile hiring of a female coach in men’s tennis this decade. The first was in 2014, when Andy Murray also hired Mauresmo.Pouille’s decision generated far less second-guessing than Murray’s, which was met with skepticism from both the news media and fellow players.“The pressure with Andy was tremendous, and the criticism that went with it was huge,” Mauresmo said. “I knew I had a lot to prove, and I knew that every match he would play would be about the job I’d done, or not done, or could do better. That was making it pretty difficult, but pretty challenging as well, and I worked really, really hard.”Pouille said many of the queries that came with his choice were more inane than negative.“A lot of people have asked me: ‘Is it different that she’s a woman? What do you do — can she come in the locker room?’” he said. “But what is important is what’s happening on court, what’s happening to get ready for the match, and what happens after the match. I don’t care who is in the locker room.”Pouille said that, for now, he appreciated the lack of wasted time in his practice sessions with Mauresmo, and also her drive and willingness to join him in his various fitness and running drills.“You can see on the court that she’s a champion,” he said. “The way she is on the court, the way she’s committed to it, it’s just remarkable.”Pouille is hoping that Mauresmo’s coaching can help him return to the top 10. Over the past three decades, French men’s tennis has packed the sport’s peloton, but it has struggled to catapult anyone into regular championship contention.Pouille is one of five active Frenchmen who can claim to have made the top 10, joining Richard Gasquet, Gilles Simon, Gaël Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Together, they have reached only one Grand Slam final in the past decade: when Tsonga finished as the runner-up at the 2008 Australian Open.Mauresmo says she probably has particular credibility in French tennis as a two-time Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1 player, accomplishments that outshine those of all the country’s other players — male or female — in her lifetime. But she is uncertain whether most men would be ready to hire a woman with less than hall-of-fame credentials.“Probably not yet,” she said. “Maybe not, but it will come. Maybe not in the next two, three, five years, but it will come.”Patience also was required as Pouille started his 2019 season. He opened the year by losing all three matches he played at the Hopman Cup, as well as another at the ATP tournament in Sydney. But on Tuesday at the Australian Open, he won his opening match convincingly, 6-1, 7-5, 6-4, over Mikhail Kukushkin.Though he was relieved by the win, Pouille said his confidence in his choice of coach had never wavered.“I know it’s going to take time, coming from a year where it has been quite difficult for me,” he said. “But I decided to work with Amélie because I trust her.”"
"Rafael Nadal, Playing a ‘Different Dimension of Tennis,’ Returns to Australian Open Final - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — There was nothing Stefanos Tsitsipas could do.He tried pressing forward, only to see Rafael Nadal’s whizzing replies fly beyond his reach.He tried staying patient, only to find himself being run across the baseline like a jack rabbit with a one-handed backhand.He tried simply to hang on, hoping against hope that his legendary opponent would grant an opening, a reprieve, a string of games, maybe a set. Nadal did no such thing.On Thursday night, Nadal once again provided every hard-hitting answer in a match at this tournament against an upstart opponent. This time he pummeled Tsitsipas, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0, moving with brutal efficiency into his fifth Australian Open final.“I am playing well today,” he said when it was over, assessing the match with a bland understatement.His inexperienced opponent offered a fuller, more exacting description. “It felt,” Tsitsipas said, “like a different dimension of tennis.”[The women’s final is set: Petra Kvitova will face Naomi Osaka.]On Sunday — having not lost a single set all tournament and looking in as fine a form on hardcourts as he has in his career — Nadal will play for a second title at Melbourne Park, 10 years after his first.He will face the winner of Friday’s semifinal between top-seeded Novak Djokovic, Nadal’s longtime rival, and Lucas Pouille, a 24-year-old Frenchman who has made his own surprisingly deep run in Melbourne. Before this tournament, Pouille had never won a match here in five tries.Nadal versus Tsitsipas was yet another match at this tournament touted as a battle of generations — all-time great versus budding YouTube sensation.Nadal, 32, has won 17 major championships and was playing his 30th Grand Slam semifinal.Tsitsipas, 20, has just a single tour title. Though he enthralled crowds and flashed his talent throughout the tournament — including an upset of the two-time defending champion Roger Federer — he is still relatively new to pro tennis. He had never previously advanced past the fourth round of a major.Despite the chasm in experience, it seemed Tsitsipas was playing well enough to have a chance.Instead, it was never close. Nadal came out sharply, targeting lethal, down-the-line groundstrokes to seize momentum with a break in the third game. From that moment, his power suffocated the young Greek.As much as Tsitsipas tried to inflict damage with flat returns, Nadal rarely seemed rushed. He was never broken. The first set was over in 31 pragmatic minutes. The second took 44. The third, another 31. By the standards of professional men’s tennis, those sets were sprints.Not long after the match was done, Tsitsipas, who was seeded 14th, looked dazed at his news conference, lacking any of the optimistic energy he’d exuded after previous matches. On Tuesday, he had explained how he’d learned from losing to Nadal last summer in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. He had remembered coming off the court there feeling he would do much better next time against the Spaniard, because now he had a sense of Nadal’s game, “especially on hardcourt.”Two days later, there was no such gumption.“He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players,” Tsitsipas said, dolefully.It looked as if he had just been pummeled in a boxing ring.“He has this, I don’t know, talent that no other player has,” Tsitsipas added. “His game style has something that it kind of makes the other half of your brain work more than it usually does. I’m trying to understand, but I cannot find an explanation.”When Nadal took to the dais a few minutes later, there was nothing but clipped certainty. His answers, coming in his familiar accented English, were all business, same as his game has been for the past two weeks. He said all the right things about focus and routine and not getting too far ahead of matters. There is a final soon to play. This is no time for idle chatter or expansive thoughts. He was bland in the way that Tom Brady is bland.“I have to keep doing the things that I am doing,” he said. “That’s my feeling, just keep playing the way that I am playing and let’s see.”Bland, but effective. Ruthlessly so.Nadal enters Sunday’s match having contested some of the most memorable finals in this tournament’s history, though he has won only one of the four. His only title here came in 2009, when he defeated Federer in five scintillating sets. In 2012, he succumbed to Djokovic after a 5-hour-53-minute marathon, the longest major tournament final on the books. In 2017, he and Federer staged the most recent of their epic major tournament duels, with Federer winning in five sets.Nadal also reached the 2014 final, but he struggled with a debilitating back injury and lost to Stan Wawrinka.Seeded second this year, Nadal began the tournament shadowed by questions about how long his body could withstand the rigors of a hardcourt Grand Slam event. He had not played a tour match since the United States Open in September, when he retired from his semifinal against Juan Martín del Potro, citing a leg injury. In November, he had ankle surgery. Then, in the run-up to the Australian Open, he withdrew from a tournament he had been scheduled to play in Brisbane, citing a thigh strain.Asked if he expected to be back in this form, playing this well, gunning in his tour return for another Grand Slam title, his reply came quick. “Is not easy to be back after four months, and play the way I am playing,” he said. “Of course, I didn’t expect that at all.”"
"A Champion for Britain, and for Women’s Tennis - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — When Andy Murray announced that he planned to retire from tennis this year because of chronic hip pain, the news generated the expected plaudits and empathy from the rivals who had shared a locker room with him for years.The most distinct voices in the chorus of praise, however, were female. In interviews and news conferences and on social media over the years, Murray established himself as a champion for equality and for women’s tennis. In doing so, he became an ally to the WTA tour, whose players have long felt unappreciated and undervalued by many in the men’s side of the sport.“I’m really bummed for him, individually, but I’m also bummed for women’s tennis, because we just lost a huge spokesperson,” said Nicole Gibbs, a 25-year-old American pro. “Not that he’ll be silent in his retirement — I think he’ll remain really outspoken, and we’ll appreciate that. But it’s nice to see friendly male tennis player faces throughout the year, so that will be sorely missed for us.”Murray has said he would like to play until Wimbledon this summer, but after a first-round loss Monday to Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut and now weighing another hip operation, he left open the possibility that he may have played the last match of his career.In more than a decade as a top-10 player, Murray has used his prominent position to be an advocate for women in tennis in ways large and small. After being taught the game by his mother, Judy, Murray became the most high-profile men’s player to hire a female coach when he added Amélie Mauresmo to his team in 2014. He also has made a point of correcting reporters when they omit women from statistics, like at Wimbledon in 2017 when he interrupted a reporter who prefaced a question by saying that Sam Querrey was the first American player to reach the semifinals there since 2009.“Male player,” Murray interrupted.Serena Williams, one of the women the reporter had overlooked, praised Murray during a television appearance.“I don’t think there’s a woman player — and there really shouldn’t be a female athlete — that is not totally supportive of Andy Murray,” Williams said. “He has spoken up for women’s issues and women’s rights, especially in tennis, forever — and he does it again. That’s one thing that we love about him.”Murray has not always been comfortable with the praise he receives for what he considers simple gestures, or with the label of “outspoken.”“I haven’t gone out of my way to talk about it,” Murray said in August. “If someone has asked me a question, I’ve given my answer. When a male athlete speaks positively about female athletes, it makes a headline — which is strange, and shouldn’t really be the case, but it is.”But more than his public pronouncements, Murray has won over female players by acknowledging and validating them in a way few other male players have. The Swiss player Timea Bacsinszky said that Murray was a rare men’s pro who would greet her and her team around tournaments and show his appreciation for her efforts.“I don’t remember where it was, but he comes to me and he’s like, ‘Oh, great job three weeks ago, you killed it, you were playing so great in the quarterfinals,’” Bacsinszky said of Murray. “I was like, Wow, the guy is looking at the women’s results as well! He just appreciates good tennis.”Murray prepared last month for a tournament in Brisbane by hitting with Naomi Osaka, the reigning United States Open champion. Osaka said she rued the news that her new practice partner could be leaving the sport soon.“I felt really sad because I’ve never really talked to him before Brisbane, right?” she said. “Then we started talking. He was so nice. Like, he’s a super nice person. Now I just feel like I lost — he’s not a friend — but I lost someone that could be a friend.”His appeal crosses generations. Billie Jean King called Murray a “champion on and off the court.”“Your greatest impact on the world may be yet to come,” King wrote on Twitter. “Your voice for equality will inspire future generations.”King, who helped the women’s tour get off the ground in the early 1970s, knows how valuable that kind of support has been, and how rare it still is at times.In 2016, Novak Djokovic, the current president of the ATP player council, was criticized by Murray and others after he said that, after years of gains by women seeking equal pay at major tournaments, men should continue to agitate for a larger share of the pot at combined events. (Djokovic later backtracked, saying his comments were “not the best articulation of my view.”)And when Italy’s Stefano Travaglia stepped down from his seat on the 10-player council at the end of last season, the council appointed Ukraine’s Sergiy Stakhovsky, a well-known lightning rod, to fill it. Stakhovsky has been dismissive of women’s tennis and its players in recent years, ridiculing the concept of equal pay and making homophobic remarks about the women’s tour.Stakhovsky’s comments have repeatedly drawn Murray’s rebuke, both publicly and privately. But they also have left women’s pros feeling little support from men’s players when debates around equal prize money have flared up, as they do periodically.“Not a lot of warmth coming from that side or that perspective,” Maria Sharapova said.Andrea Petkovic said allies were crucial to the women’s game as it seeks to maintain the level of equality it has achieved, and as it seeks to close remaining gaps. And that is why she said she would miss Murray as well.“He was always my favorite, and I think it will be a huge loss for tennis in general, but also for the WTA,” she said. “Because even nowadays, when you think everything is equal, you still need men, especially successful men, to speak up for women.”Murray’s reputation as a supporter of women gained notice far beyond the corridors of tennis. Before the 2017 United States Open, he was profiled in Elle Magazine. And last year, when the comedian Sarah Silverman was describing her ideal man in an interview on Ellen DeGeneres’s television show, she said, “I like a masculine man, but he has to be a feminist — that contrast is very hot to me.”“Like Andy Murray,” DeGeneres suggested.“Oh my God, like Andy Murray!” Silverman exclaimed. “Yes!”"
"Tennis: Men's Olympic Final to Be Best-Of-Three Sets - The New York Times
LONDON — The men's tennis final at next year's Tokyo Olympics will change format to a best-of-three tiebreak sets instead of five, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said on Wednesday.The decision brings the men's gold medal match into line with other Olympic singles matches which are all played as best-of-three sets.The ITF said men's and women's doubles matches would feature a match tiebreak to 10 points when tied at one-set all, as is the case in mixed doubles.""These amendments reduce concerns of overplay for players who reach the latter stages of all three events -- singles, doubles and mixed doubles,"" the ITF said in a statement.

"UEFA Charge Ireland Over Tennis Ball Protest - The New York Times
(Reuters) - UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings against Ireland on Thursday after supporters hurled tennis balls onto the field during their European Championship qualifier against Georgia.The match in Dublin on Tuesday was held up for up to three minutes as Ireland fans threw dozens of tennis balls in protest at chief executive John Delaney's continued role at the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).Delaney stood down as the FAI's chief executive last week, days before he was due to appear before lawmakers over a 100,000 euro ($112,450) loan provided to the governing body.However, the FAI created a new position of executive vice-president for Delaney, who will remain with the association he led since 2005.The Irish FA could not be immediately reached for comment. The case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary panel on May 16. (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"At Australian Open, a Legacy Tracing Back to a Backyard in Mexico - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Emilio Nava stood at the microphone on the court of Rod Laver Arena and smiled broadly.“Wow,” he said, smiling again. “Wow.”It was hard to know he had just lost. Nava, 17, seeded 13th, saved three championship points and held one of his own before falling, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (12), to top-seeded Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the Australian Open boys’ singles final on Saturday. (On Friday, Nava lost in the boys’ doubles final.)Despite the double dose of disappointment, he remained undimmed.“It means the world to come out here on Rod Laver and play, thank you so much,” he said. “Hopefully I’ll be back, and see you later, thank you!”The foundation of tennis success in Nava’s family can be traced to an undersized court in a small town in Mexico. His grandfather Ernesto Escobedo Sr. fell in love with the sport when he watched a Davis Cup tie in Los Angeles. After moving his large family to Jerez, Mexico, he built a tennis court, or as much of one as he could fit, in the family’s backyard.Xóchitl Nava, Emilio’s mother, said the little court her father built had its limitations, but also offered boundless opportunities.“On one side of the court, we didn’t have room to hit a backhand or forehand,” she said in a telephone interview. “So it was a tennis court, but more of a playground where we could hit balls and have fun.”Their father’s passion for tennis rubbed off on many of his 10 children.“When we started getting older, everybody went their own ways,” Xóchitl Nava said. “But we were always playing tennis.”That court spurred her to a modest professional career — she reached a high of 284th and represented Mexico in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. But it proved an even stronger trampoline for the next generation: Nava’s reaching two junior Grand Slam finals at this tournament alone is just the latest example. Xóchitl Nava’s nephew Ernesto Escobedo reached a career-best ATP ranking of No. 68 in 2017. Her oldest son, Eduardo, plays at Wake Forest, the reigning national champion. Her middle son, Diego, plays for Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles.Emilio Nava first made a splash at the elite junior level by reaching the final of the prestigious Eddie Herr tournament last year. He stays in touch with his tennis-playing cousins and siblings in an active group chat.“It’s everything, really,” he said of the sport. “Especially when you train every day, it becomes a lifestyle, you know? It becomes every day that you’re thinking about it — you try to relax a little bit, but it’s still there. But it’s fun, yeah, yeah, for sure.”He now splits his time between California and Alicante, Spain, where he trains at the Juan Carlos Ferrero Equelite Sport Academy. When he is home in Woodland Hills, Calif., he trains across the street at the backyard court of his cousin Jaime’s house.On Sunday, Xóchitl Nava expressed little disappointment about Emilio’s defeat.“Seeing him in the finals, for us, it’s like a dream,” she said. “We’re just very lucky and fortunate to have Emilio, and to watch him play in a big stadium like that, it’s really unbelievable.”"
"As Men’s Team Tennis Events Rise, the Coed Hopman Cup Is Left in Limbo - The New York Times
PERTH, Australia — When Serena Williams and Roger Federer played against each other for the first time, on Tuesday night at the Hopman Cup, it was the ultimate expression of an event that has brought the best men and best women in tennis together for more than three decades.But despite the power of seeing Williams and Federer on opposite sides of the net, the future of the Hopman Cup is uncertain, with a new men’s team event set to eclipse it, part of a trend of realignment and reinvention in tennis. Tennis Australia, which manages the Hopman Cup, will next year help organize the ATP Cup, a 10-day tournament that will have men’s teams from 24 countries competing across three Australian cities for ranking points and $15 million in prize money.With mixed doubles increasingly outstripped in prize money and prestige at Grand Slam events, the Hopman Cup — with two-person teams from eight countries competing in singles and mixed doubles — is the lone place to see top men and top women team up besides the Olympics.Though Federer did not participate in the Hopman Cup through the middle years of his career, he has a long attachment to the event, first coming to Perth as a hitting partner in 1999. He won the tournament with Martina Hingis in 2001 about a month before taking his first title on the ATP Tour. At the next Hopman Cup, he partnered with his future wife, Mirka Vavrinec.[Read: Roger Federer struggles with Serena Williams’s serve. And vice versa.]“Men and women, we share a lot of tournaments together, but it’s not the same as when you play each other or share the same court,” Federer said. “So I think the players have always enjoyed this event.”The Hopman Cup’s distinction as a mixed event stands in contrast to the trend of new team tennis concepts for men only. Tennis Australia has taken an aggressive role in event creation, cofounding the men-only Laver Cup and the ATP Cup in recent years.That focus on men’s tennis could doom the coed Hopman Cup. The host cities for the ATP Cup have not yet been announced, but the state-of-the-art Perth Arena, where the Hopman Cup has been held since 2013, is a likely choice. Even if Perth is not chosen, it would be difficult to imagine Tennis Australia hosting two competing team events in the same week.The Hopman Cup remains an oddity in its 31st year, at once a playful exhibition that serves as a relaxing lead-up to the Australian Open and, since 1997, an officially sanctioned International Tennis Federation event.The tournament has been bankrolled by the Western Australian government’s tourism body, Tourism W.A. Player appearance contracts have included clauses forbidding them from criticizing Perth, and at times the programming can feel like an infomercial for the region. After his first match at this year’s tournament, Federer gave an on-court interview that centered on his appreciation for the region and a photo shoot at a scenic rock formation nearby.Among locals, the main concern is less about preserving the Hopman Cup and more about making sure that isolated Perth, which is 1,300 miles from another city of more than 100,000 people, keeps a foothold in tennis and is not left out of the pre-Australian Open swing.In the wider tennis community, the Hopman Cup’s uniqueness is appreciated. It has rarely sparked the tribal passions on which Davis Cup prides itself, but the Hopman Cup has been a crowd-pleasing event, cherished by tennis fans who have savored the opportunity to see the sport’s top women and top men compete and commingle.The New Year’s Day battle of Williams and Frances Tiafoe against Federer and Belinda Bencic represented an apex of many captivating Hopman Cup combinations. Marat Safin and Dinara Safina, the only brother-sister pair to both reach the No. 1 ranking, played together for Russia in 2009. Boris Becker and Steffi Graf played together in 1992 for the only time in their careers, a pairing of stars so sought after that a German television station helped the tournament organizers pay the players’ appearance fees.The tournament has also featured some irresistible matchups of men’s and women’s stars who would never otherwise intersect. In the 2011 final, the 5-foot-5 Justine Henin tried to return the booming serve of the 6-foot-10 John Isner.Not everyone is ready to write an obituary for the event, though. David Haggerty, president of the I.T.F., which sanctions the Hopman Cup as its official mixed team competition, said the event was “very, very important and should continue.”Haggerty said he expected Tennis Australia to honor its remaining contractual obligations for managing the Hopman Cup in the first week of the season, which run through 2022.“We’re just excited to continue to see Hopman Cup through because it is a great way to have the men and women playing,” said Haggerty, who spearheaded a massive overhaul of the Davis Cup format last year despite strong resistance from governing bodies, including Tennis Australia.If Saturday’s final was the event’s last gasp, it had a breathtaking finish, with Federer and Bencic prevailing in an 18-shot rally on a winner-take-all final point against Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, clinching a second straight title for the Swiss pair.Tennis Australia’s Paul Kilderry, who serves as the Hopman Cup’s tournament director, declined to comment for this article, citing uncertainty about the tournament’s future.As Haggerty expressed reason for the Hopman Cup to endure, Ross Hutchins, the ATP vice president for player relations, was scouting Perth Arena as a potential venue for the ATP Cup, for which he will be managing director. Hutchins is also visiting Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney, which all have existing tennis facilities.“Ultimately we thought this time of year, leading into a Grand Slam, is important to do something major in, and that’s what we will target,” Hutchins said. “This event will be a major event on the ATP Tour.”The ATP Cup is landing in a jam-packed first week of the tennis season, which this year has seven tournaments: the Hopman Cup; WTA tournaments in Auckland, New Zealand, and Shenzhen, China; ATP tournaments in Doha, Qatar, and Pune, India; and a combined ATP-WTA tournament in Brisbane. Hutchins said only one of the ATP events would remain on the schedule as a complement to the ATP Cup, with no survivor yet designated.The ATP is eager to add more events that it will own outright. The ATP Cup will be the third new annual men’s team event introduced since 2017. The Federer-backed Laver Cup, which pits a European team against one from the rest of the world, is held in September. The reworked 18-country Davis Cup will culminate in November. Hutchins said he thought there was room for all three to flourish.“I don’t think there is a fatigue of team events because it’s not something that we think is diluted, and they’re all slightly different,” he said.But there is nothing quite like the Hopman Cup on the horizon. Without any fixed plans for the event’s end or its continuation, players and organizers at this year’s tournament participated with a mixture of wistfulness and confusion.In the afterglow of her match with Federer, Williams was caught off-guard by a question about the Hopman Cup’s probable demise. “Oh, really? I never heard that,” Williams said. “It would be heartbreaking.”"
"For Australian Men, Off-Court Drama Overshadows the Tennis - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — As the tennis world was transfixed on Andy Murray  as he played what may have been the final match of his career last Monday night, another drama was beginning in Interview Room 2 at the Australian Open.After a first-round loss, Australia’s Bernard Tomic launched the opening volley in an off-court rift between Lleyton Hewitt and some of the top male players in Australian tennis, a conflict that kept heads turning and eyes rolling throughout the tournament’s first week.“I’m going to say it honestly: No one likes him anymore,” Tomic said of Hewitt, the country’s most successful men’s player in the past 20 years and the current Davis Cup captain.Australian men’s tennis was a dominant force in the sport in the 1950s and 1960s, producing players who won 52 of the 80 Grand Slam singles titles in that span. Hewitt arrived on the scene many years later and in the early 2000s, finished two seasons at No. 1 and captured two Grand Slam titles.But ever since Hewitt fell out of the top tier in 2006, Australia has not had a male Grand Slam singles champion or a top-10 men’s player. Instead, men’s tennis in the country has now become a soap opera, more memorable for its spats than its results on the court.At this Open, every Australian man fell out of the tournament after just six days. It meant that the host country had failed to have a representative in the second week of men’s singles for the eighth time in the past 13 years. Meanwhile, an Australian woman, 15th-seeded Ashleigh Barty, plays on into the quarterfinals, her mellow and modest manner perhaps making up for the men’s maddening mayhem.And a lot of that mayhem has to do with Hewitt, who retired with considerable fanfare at the 2016 Australian Open and segued into a new role as the Davis Cup captain. But his debut in that role was dominated by infighting, with Tomic, in a midmatch rant to Hewitt, accusing his teammate Nick Kyrgios of faking an illness. Hewitt, in turn, failed to quell Tomic’s ire.Last Monday, Tomic accused Hewitt of a litany of misdeeds as Davis Cup captain, including giving preferential treatment to players with whom he had management deals and continuing to play doubles tournaments and in the Davis Cup as well.Tomic said he and others did not want to play Davis Cup anymore because Hewitt “has ruined the system.”“Go away,” he added. “Literally, if he is retired, why is he still in tennis? Why do you play these doubles tournaments?”Hewitt entered the men’s doubles events in Brisbane, Sydney and the Australian Open this month.Rather than defuse the flames, Hewitt fanned them in his own extraordinary news conference after his loss in Melbourne on Thursday night. He accused Tomic of unspecified threats and “blackmail” against him and his family, essentially giving up any hope of working with Tomic again.“We’re trying to set cultural standards for the Davis Cup and representing Australia; he hasn’t really been close to those in the last couple of years,” Hewitt said.Hewitt said that Tomic “won’t play Davis Cup while I have anything to do with it,” but that his relationship with Kyrgios, another controversy-prone Australian, was “salvageable.”“All I want guys to do is to commit to the sport and work hard, to want to play for Australia,” Hewitt said. “I don’t think that’s too much to ask.”Tomic, 26, and Kyrgios, 23, were junior Grand Slam champions and undeniable talents whose professional careers have been a mix of bright spots and bad moments, with both players seeming to relish the chance to challenge the idealistic Australian notion as to how a sportsman should conduct himself.Kyrgios, who also lost in the first round of this tournament, mostly mocked the questions he received about Tomic and Hewitt in his post-match news conference last Tuesday. He did not pick a side.But it was clear Kyrgios also had soured on Hewitt after he posted a picture on Instagram on Wednesday of Hewitt watching Alex de Minaur, the recent Sydney champion who has become his protégé, and implying that Hewitt would not be watching any other Australian player.Hewitt, 37, responded by saying Kyrgios’s post was “one of the standards we can’t put up with.”“Just for the culture of Australian tennis moving forward, can’t do it,” Hewitt added. “I don’t think it’s a good look. I’ve spoken to Nick about it. He understands that. Whether he learns from it, that’s another thing.”On Sunday, Kyrgios posted a photo of himself with de Minaur on Twitter, seeming to clarify that any bad blood is strictly intergenerational.De Minaur, 19, is currently the highest-ranked Australian man, at No. 29. He has a game built on dazzling defense, with some of the flashiest footwork on tour. Increasingly, he is presented as a golden boy of the sport in contrast to the ne’er-do-wells Tomic and Kyrgios. De Minaur is so committed to playing for Australia that he has “109” tattooed on his chest because he was the 109th player to represent the country in Davis Cup.As all of this was playing out, Matt Dwyer, the chief tennis officer of Tennis Australia, got involved, too, issuing a statement on Friday that highlighted de Minaur, Alex Bolt and 19-year-old Alexei Popyrin, all of whom made the third round here, and praising “each player’s unwavering passion to compete and their genuine love of the game, all underpinned by the Tennis Australia values of excellence, loyalty, teamwork and humility.’’“Support and opportunities will be offered to players who live these values and demonstrate the commitment to maximize their potential, with our ultimate ambition being to develop and foster athletes we can all be proud of,’’ the statement added.The statement did not mention Tomic and Kyrgios.Other talented Australian boys have fallen short in recent years. Omar Jasika, who won the 2014 United States Open in boys’ singles and doubles, received a two-year ban last year after testing positive for cocaine.Oliver Anderson, the 2016 Australian Open boys’ singles champion, served a 19-month provisional suspension for match-fixing for deliberately losing a set in a 2017 match.There has also been recent tragedy: Todd Reid, the 2002 Wimbledon boys’ singles champion, died in October at 34.Asked if he was uncomfortable with the good-kids-versus-bad-kids narrative that predominates Australian men’s tennis, de Minaur demurred.“There’s a lot of stuff that happens off court, but I think at the end of the day what I really want is to be that boring guy that lets his tennis do the talking, you know?” he said. “I want everyone to know that I’m that kid that’s going to leave it all out there, fight till the end, and just continuously want to improve. If I’m that boring guy in the media, then I’m doing something right.”De Minaur has been able to stay away from the fray by making his base in Alicante, Spain. After soundly beating de Minaur in the third round, Rafael Nadal said he wished Tomic and Hewitt could learn from de Minaur’s aversion to advertising adversity.“Will be more normal if they sit and they talk,” Nadal said, “more than do this thing here in the media.”As Hewitt lurched toward the end of a news conference that John McEnroe described as “pouring gasoline on the fire,” he did not deny that there was toxicity in the men’s tennis culture in Australia. But he insisted that there were good stories, too, including John Millman’s upset of Roger Federer at the 2018 United States OpenFor Hewitt, the most disappointing part was that the comments of a first-round loser overshadowed other Australian players’ victories.“It’s one clown making a silly comment, and that’s the main news,” Hewitt said as his packed news conference stretched into its 14th minute."
"How Are Ties Broken in Tennis? That Depends - The New York Times
Difficult as it might be to remember at this time-is-money stage in tennis, the sport once had no tiebreakers.Long ago, every set had to be won by a two-game margin and theoretically had no finish line. Which meant that at Wimbledon in the first round of the men’s singles in 1969, the great but aging Pancho Gonzales defeated Charlie Pasarell by the score of 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9 in a two-day match that lasted five hours and 12 minutes.The tiebreaker was introduced to Grand Slam tennis the following year at the 1970 United States Open, with red flags being flown courtside whenever a set reached 6-6.It has taken 49 more years for the major tournaments to reach the awkward phase where all four use different methods to resolve deciding sets in singles.The red flags are long gone, but the novelty effect is back. The Australian Open, which begins on Monday, will use a best-of-18-point tiebreaker at 6-6 in deciding sets, which are third sets for the women and fifth sets for the men.Later this year, Wimbledon will introduce a conventional best-of-12-point tiebreaker at 12-12. That will leave the French Open as the only Grand Slam tournament that uses no deciding-set tiebreaker in singles.“I think the International Tennis Federation, the ATP and the Grand Slams should find, more or less, some consistency of the rules for the understanding of the public,” Guy Forget, the French Open tournament director, said in an interview. Consistency and mutual understanding seem particularly elusive at this fractious stage of the game.The Grand Slam leaders meet regularly and have usually made a big effort to project unity in the last 30 years as their tournaments have grown and prospered. But they have squabbled much more often lately.There have been disputes about the possible introduction of in-match coaching, which Wimbledon’s leadership continues to oppose. There have been disagreements about the new Laver Cup team event, which the Australian Open and U.S. Open are formally backing.It seems symbolic that, with the Australian Open’s switch from Wilson to Dunlop, each of the four Grand Slam tournaments is using balls manufactured by a different company this year.Breaking ranks over tiebreakers is the latest sign of the times, even if it hardly seems a major offense.Other sports also lack consensus. Consider men’s golf, which has four majors of its own and four ways of resolving ties at the top of the leaderboard after 72 holes.Despite any confusion, fans still seem quite capable of enjoying golf. Tennis fans surely will end up feeling the same even if tiebreakers in their sport are a great deal more common than golf playoffs.Top tennis players had best remain alert, however.“I’m O.K. with any format, really,” said Roger Federer, the Swiss superstar who remains a traditionalist on some fronts, including in-match coaching. “The funny thing is we have different formats now in four different Slams, so it’s just important to remind yourself when you do get to 6-all in the fifth, what’s going on here now? Do you remember which one it is?”For women, that internal dialogue will come at 6-all in the third set even if there has been little concern about the length of Grand Slam women’s matches, which are all best-of-three sets.“I was enjoying it, because you have to go far, and you don’t know how the score will be at the end,” said Angelique Kerber, who lost a taut Australian Open semifinal to Simona Halep last year 6-3, 4-6, 9-7. “I will miss it, for sure, but I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad rule change. We will see.”One wonders what Jimmy Van Alen would think of it all. It was Van Alen, a wealthy American, who pushed for brisker, innovative formats — including the tiebreaker — in the 1960s. Van Alen, a former play who died in 1991, was also one of the driving forces in creating the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.“Jimmy Van Alen would not have liked the confusion of different ways of concluding matches at the four Grand Slam events,” said Steve Flink, an American tennis historian who met Van Alen several times.Van Alen’s idea of a sudden-death tiebreaker managed to change the game in earnest — a best-of-nine-point duel with a winner-take-all point at 4-4, which in a decisive set could give both players a match point simultaneously.This was the tiebreaker the U.S. Open adopted for all sets in 1970 at 6-6 but abandoned in 1975 in favor of the best-of-12-point tiebreaker that had to be won by two and seemed, to the players, less of a lottery. Wimbledon embraced the best-of-12-point tiebreaker in 1971, but chose to use it at 8-8 instead of 6-6.“I guess tennis has always had some inexplicable inconsistencies with formats and scoring systems,” Flink said.Wimbledon maintained its scoring system until 1979, when it opted for tiebreakers at 6-6, waiting 40 years before adopting a decisive-set tiebreaker at 12-12 after last year’s semifinal between Kevin Anderson and John Isner (Anderson finally won, 26-24, in the fifth set on Centre Court, disrupting the tournament’s schedule).“I know Jimmy Van Alen was dismayed when his original sudden death nine-point tiebreaker was discarded,” Flink said. “But I have no doubt he would have preferred the Australian Open fifth-set tiebreaker to what Wimbledon is doing. Waiting until 12-12 in the fifth would not have suited him at all.”But for this year at least, the French Open remains the last Grand Slam holdout, a decision Forget said came about because, unlike Wimbledon, the French Open had not had an ultramarathon final set in recent seasons.“We will not go with the tiebreak for now,” Forget said. “But I hope personally that our sport will adopt new rules in the future as we need to modernize our game a bit.”"
"Tennis-Wozniacki and Keys to Meet for Charleston Title - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki maintained her dominance over Croatia's Petra Martic on Saturday to move into the final of the Charleston Open where she will play Madison Keys.Dane Wozniacki, showing confidence after a recent illness, defeated Martic 6-3 6-4 before American Keys turned back Monica Puig 6-4 6-0 in a semi-final that was delayed for more than an hour by rain.""I'm just so thrilled to be healthy, that's the main thing,"" the fifth-seeded Wozniacki said after making her first final of the year.""It's been a long time since I made this long run here,"" said the Dane who won the South Carolina tournament in 2011.The fifth seed broke Martic twice in the second set to claim the win and maintain her record of never having lost a set to Martic in six meetings.""I served well in most of the match and I think I returned really well most of the match as well, and I just tried to stay aggressive as much as I could and tried to make (Martic) run and make her move,"" Wozniacki said.Wozniacki, world number 13, grabbed a 4-2 lead in the second set but the 16th-seeded Martic bounced back to level at 4-4 before the Dane broke back and closed out the match. “I thought I was close,"" said Martic. ""But many players feel this way against Caroline. I felt like I couldn’t keep up with her physically."" Keys led 4-3 in the first set when rain halted her match with Puerto Rico's Puig. The big-hitting American, who upset top seed Sloane Stephens in the quarter-finals, lost only one more game, winning eight in a row to seal victory.Keys closed out the first set with a forehand service return, then broke Puig, the Olympic champion, three times in the decider.Puig did not go quickly in the final game, though, saving three match points before Keys hit a big forehand return on a fourth match point to force an error from Puig.The rain delay helped Keys.""Honestly it was good,"" she said. ""I had just gotten broken and I got to go inside a reset. I think I did a pretty good job to close it out.""Keys, who has lost to Wozniacki twice, said meeting the Dane on clay could work in her favour.""It's a little bit of a slower court,"" Keys said. ""My heavy ball will work better so I think I will be able to do a little more."" (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Ed Osmond)"

"Tennis: Sakkari Beats Defending Champion Bertens at Charleston - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Defending champion Kiki Bertens suffered a surprise 7-6(8) 6-3 loss to world number 50 Maria Sakkari in the third round of the Charleston Open in South Carolina on Thursday.On a day when top seed Sloane Stephens survived a scare before beating Ajla Tomljanovic 4-6 6-4 6-4, Sakkari showcased supreme court coverage skills throughout her almost two-hour match against Bertens.Sakkari clinched the match after breaking the second-seeded Dutchwoman, who was playing on her preferred clay surface, for the seventh time in the contest.Sakkari, the 15th seed, saved four set points in the opener and held steady the rest of the way to secure her third career top-10 victory following wins over Caroline Wozniacki in 2017 and Karolina Pliskova last year.The win also righted the ship for Sakkari, who after a strong start to the year that included a run to the third round at the Australian Open, fell in the early stages of tournaments is St. Petersburg, Acapulco, Indian Wells and Miami.""I'm pretty excited and speechless,"" Sakkari said on court. ""I had a rough two months after the Australian Open, I was losing in the first round, second round and I really wanted to come back stronger.""Finally I came back and I'm feeling great.""Up next for Sakkari will be fifth seed Wozniacki, who beat 12th-seeded Romanian Mihaela Buzarnescu 6-4 3-6 6-3.In the late match, Australian Tomljanovic won the first set with an exquisite backhand drop volley that American Stephens could not retrieve.Tomljanovic reeled off 13 straight points early in the second set, hitting a series of winners to race to a 3-0 lead, but Stephens wrested back the momentum as quickly as she had lost it.Croatian-born Tomljanovic continued to go for her shots in the final set but while she hit more winners than her opponent, Stephens prevailed by making fewer errors.Earlier on Thursday, ninth seed Belinda Bencic extended her fine form with a 6-2 7-5 win over Taylor Townsend to reach the quarter-finals while Petra Martic beat Jessica Pegula 2-6 6-3 6-2.World number 21 Bencic, who entered the match having lost only six games all week, grabbed eight of the opening nine points to set the tone early.""The key was to put pressure on her.

"Roger Federer Struggles With Serena Williams’s Serve. And Vice Versa. - The New York Times
PERTH, Australia — After nearly two decades of appearing alongside each other on billboards and in record books, Serena Williams and Roger Federer faced off across a tennis court for the first time on Tuesday.The incandescent stars, now both 37, finally aligned for the first time by taking part in a mixed doubles match between the United States and Switzerland at the Hopman Cup team event.On the opening point, Williams pulled Federer wide to his forehand side with a sharply angled volley, then sent a smash toward the opposite corner that he could not reach in time to send back. Long exchanges between the two proved few, however, with each using their serve to effectively neutralize the other.It did not seem to matter to the crowd of 14,064 in Perth Arena, the highest single-session attendance in the event’s 31-year history, and Williams and Federer clearly delighted in the chance to hit the ball around with each other a couple of weeks before more serious play occurs at the Australian Open.“It was a great experience,” Williams said as she joined Federer on court after the match. “I’m kind of sad it’s over. It was just warming up.”Federer and his partner, Belinda Bencic, beat Williams and Frances Tiafoe in an abbreviated format match by the score of 4-2, 4-3 (5-3) in 46 minutes.Despite the initial, promising exchange in the first set, Williams and Federer seemed to settle into more conservative play; in the entire first set, neither Federer nor Williams succeeded in making a single return off the other’s serve.(There were, technically, two other people on the court as well. Bencic hit a pivotal return winner off Tiafoe’s serve that helped Switzerland take the lead in the first set.)Federer and Williams both gained more of a foothold on the other’s serve in the second set, which was highlighted by a six-shot exchange of powerful cross-court groundstrokes between the two before Federer won the point by ripping a forehand toward Tiafoe.Williams and Federer afterward sized each other up.“I was nervous returning, because you just don’t know,” Federer said. “People talk about her serve so much, and I see why it is such a wonderful serve, because you just can’t read it.”“I can’t read yours either,” Williams interjected, laughing.“We have the same qualities, you know?” Federer said.“Yours is a bit better,” he added, provoking a good-natured eye roll from Williams.“It was great, great fun,” Federer added. “She’s a great champion — you see how focused and determined she is — and I love that about her.”Williams eagerly reciprocated.“I mean, the guy is great, he’s the greatest of all time, to be honest,” Williams said, drawing applause from the crowd (Williams has said she doubted she could beat Federer in a singles match).“He has a killer serve,” she said. “Literally, you can’t read it, and there’s a reason why he’s the greatest, because you can’t be that great and not have an awesome weapon like that serve.”That Williams’s serve would prove daunting to one of the best men’s players is no surprise, especially one day after she had sent a clean ace past the reach of 6-foot 4-inch Stefanos Tsitsipas in a mixed doubles match.“Like I had any chance of returning that one,” Tsitsipas wrote on Twitter, replying to an image of the serve spinning well beyond his reach.After Williams insisted that they hold rackets during an on-court selfie, she and Federer walked back to their seats with their arms wrapped around each other, and Federer said his racket was hers to keep.As she carried it into the players’ area of Perth Arena alongside Tiafoe, Williams stared at the racket with visible wonderment, showing it to her partner and letting him hold it briefly.“I was so excited,” Williams told reporters. “Literally, it was the match of my career. I don’t know, just playing someone so great, and someone that you admire so much — and a match that actually means something. It’s not often that that happens.”The mixed doubles win gave the tie to Switzerland, who are the defending champions after Federer and Bencic won the competition last year. Switzerland will qualify for Saturday’s final if it beats Greece on Thursday in Group B. The United States, which lost to Greece on Monday, can not advance.Williams, meanwhile, expressed mild disappointment at her play, especially considering her superior doubles pedigree of 16 Grand Slam titles to Federer’s none.“I’m the one that won those doubles Grand Slams, but it didn’t look like it,” she said.Williams said she had been tempted to bring her 16-month old daughter, Olympia, to the match. She ultimately decided against that, settling for having an unforgettable story to tell her.“Men and women’s tennis just don’t compete against each other,” she said. “So it’s just really great and special to go against the greatest of all time.”After this summit of superstars, Federer could tell his children the same thing."
"Serena Williams Is Back at Australian Open, for Tennis and So Much More - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — The last time Serena Williams came here for the Australian Open, in 2017, the talk swirling around her focused on tennis. Could she capture her 23rd major title and break past Steffi Graf on the list of Grand Slam title winners since the sport went professional?She did indeed emerge victorious, beating her sister Venus in the final and doing so, she would later reveal to the world, while in the early stages of pregnancy.On Tuesday, Williams returns to the sunbaked Melbourne courts, with her 16-month-old daughter in tow, bidding for another place in the record books. This time, though, her tennis is nearly an afterthought.Four months ago, in the final of the United States Open, Williams’s most compelling moments came during angry outbursts against the umpire that won both praise and criticism, propelling an already epochal athlete to the very forefront of debates about sports and gender, race and power.That flare-up is still being frequently discussed as the Australian Open begins this week, though Williams herself is not expected to speak to reporters before she plays.“Serena has actually expanded her presence in people’s lives,” Delia Douglas, a Canadian sociologist who studies women in athletics, said in an interview. “The way people talk about her, the way people debate her and what she stands for, is now heightened.”Her tennis is certainly still part of the discussion.“We all know Serena is very dangerous when she’s fit and when she’s healthy,” said Chris Evert, the former world No. 1 who is now an analyst for ESPN.But just as many, if not more, focus on what Williams means.As Soraya Chemaly, a prominent feminist activist and social critic, explained: She fits perfectly in these times, “when so much of what is happening in our world is related to gender and race and power. And right now, you can see it. Serena is sitting at that nexus, at the very intersection of all these important social conversations.”The powerful combination of her celebrity, the internet and social media amplifies the discussion each year she continues to play, threatening to overshadow the tournaments she plays in.The last time she played the Australian Open, she was pregnant. Eight months later, she nearly died during childbirth. She named her baby girl Alexis Olympia. Months afterward, she married her daughter’s father, Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of the popular website Reddit.Williams, same as ever, did not shy from attention — or from making a point. She shared her story publicly and said she was experiencing the same troubles faced by many other mothers. In her first Grand Slam tournament after childbirth, the 2018 French Open, she was not in shape, and she withdrew with an injury in the fourth round. She wore a sleek, black, full-body tennis suit. It was part fashion statement, part medical necessity — it reduced the chances of a recurrence of blood clots she experienced during childbirth.But the “cat suit,” as it came to be called, was so controversial that French tennis officials discussed banning outfits like it from Roland Garros in the future. (As a countermove, the WTA, which governs the women’s tour apart from the Grand Slams, clarified its rules to allow compression garments to be worn without skirts or dresses over them.)Undeterred, Williams spoke pointedly at Wimbledon about protecting rights of new mothers — on the tour and in the workplace. She marched through the draw. But, still out of shape, she lost in the final. A few weeks later, she withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Montreal, eventually citing postpartum depression, a condition that afflicts about 15 percent of all mothers but is often dogged by stigma.Then came the United States Open.Nobody here in Melbourne has forgotten what happened during the women’s singles final. Carlos Ramos, the umpire, spotted Williams’s coach motioning at her to be more aggressive. Ramos warned about a coaching infraction. Williams shouted with an angry, unyielding insistence that she had done nothing wrong, that she would never cheat.Nobody has forgotten the smashed racket, the point deducted as a penalty, her continued shouting: “You’re a thief,” she defiantly yelled at Ramos.Nor has anybody forgotten the game taken away as another penalty, Williams’s assertion that male players often behave badly and get away with it, the booing and the tumult, and finally her surprising loss to Naomi Osaka, a rising star who may threaten her again in this tournament.Admirers praised Williams for showing courage, for being willing to stand up to a man, for being a black woman ready to argue her point in front of everyone, for enduring long years of racial slights, for engaging boldly nonetheless — and for never losing any of her fire. (A cartoon with racist imagery lampooning Williams in an Australian newspaper shortly after the U.S. Open was yet another reminder of those slights.)Critics saw her as unhinged. This had nothing to do with womanhood or being African-American, they said. To them, she had behaved like a spoiled and raving maniac. More than that, they claimed, she had obscured the performance of a lifetime by Osaka, who had played remarkably from the start.But who could be surprised that Osaka got short shrift? Win or lose, the talk is almost always about Serena.Chemaly, the social critic, noted how, during a tour for her new book, “Rage Becomes Her,” “people kept bringing up Serena.”The book urges women to be unafraid of showing rightful anger.Chemaly said she had been asked: “‘What do you think of Serena Williams?’ ‘What does she mean for this moment?’ ‘How would you compare what happened at the U.S. Open to Brett Kavanaugh’” and the anger he displayed before a Congressional panel?“People really want to think about what it means,” Chemaly said.During 2018, Williams, 37, went without a major title for the first time since 2011 (she skipped the Australian Open in 2018, still recovering from giving birth in September 2017), and she did not play another tournament after the U.S. Open.But this is a new year. Based on her play during a string of exhibition matches in Perth — where fans greeted her warmly — and during practices this week in Melbourne, she looks primed to win again.If she does, she’ll have achieved yet another milestone: a 24th major singles title, tying the former Australian great Margaret Court, whose Grand Slam championships came in both the amateur and professional eras.“She seems fitter than last year,” Evert said of Williams. “The scary thought, looking at the women — they have to be thinking at this point, ‘Gosh, she was 60-70 percent last year, reaching two Grand Slam finals. And now she seems fitter, leaner. She’s moving better. She’s fresher.”People are talking. “She’s so controversial now, everyone here will be paying close attention to that first match,” one local fan, Jess Stow, 34, said, echoing a commonly heard sentiment as she walked with her 2-year-old son near the Australian Open grounds a day before play was set to begin. “What will she end up saying?”But so far Williams hasn’t said much. In Perth, she avoided discussion of the U.S. Open partly by keeping her news briefing to just a few minutes.She did tell GQ Magazine in November that Ramos, the umpire at the U.S. Open, should have defused the contretemps by telling her about the signals from her coach before punishing her. It would have let her set things straight without the penalty, she said.“Tell me that something’s happening,” she said, and she would tell her coaching box, “‘Whatever you’re doing, don’t.’”Otherwise, she has held her peace in Melbourne. Her racket may offer her most meaningful reply."
"Tennis: Azarenka Upsets Kerber, Faces Muguruza in Monterrey Final - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Victoria Azarenka used her superior serving and punishing groundstrokes to upset top seed Angelique Kerber 6-4 4-6 6-1 and advance to Sunday's final of the Monterrey Open against Garbine Muguruza.In a battle of former world number ones the momentum shifted in the Belarusian's favor early in the third set when Kerber committed two double faults in a careless service game to hand Azarenka a 2-0 lead.Azarenka seized the opportunity, consolidating the break in the next game before cruising to the finish line to reach her first final in more than three years.""I'm very pleased with how I played today,"" she said in an on-court interview on a warm night in northern Mexico.""It was an important match and to see how I can do under pressure against a top player,"" she said. ""I haven't won many of those in the last couple years so it's good that I'm able to turn it around and pick up my level.""Earlier, second seed Muguruza eased past Slovak Magdalena Rybarikova 6-2 6-3 to book her ticket to the final.Azarenka came out the victor in her only previous meeting with Spaniard Muguruza, a hard-fought 7-6(6) 7-6(4) win on the hard courts in Miami in 2016.

"Radu Albot, Trained on Wooden Courts of Moldova, Earns His Country’s First Title - The New York Times
DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — As Radu Albot became the first player from Moldova to win an ATP title on Sunday, his small home country in Eastern Europe was holding parliamentary elections.Unlike four years ago, when he was in France for a tennis tournament and spent about $200 on a taxi to the Moldovan Embassy so he could cast a ballot, Albot said he could not make his way to a voting booth on Sunday.This time, he was busy in the Delray Beach Open final, where he held off Dan Evans to capture the title, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7), and earn $97,490, the biggest payday of his career.Albot, 29, has been on tour for more than a decade but is only now hitting his stride. Entering the Delray Beach Open he was ranked No. 82 in the world, just off his career high of No. 81, set nearly two years ago. With the win over Evans, in which he saved three match points, Albot moved to a new career high of No. 52.Albot is the first player, man or woman, from Moldova to be ranked within the world’s top 100. Most have never broken the top 300.Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of 3.55 million, is better known for producing wine than tennis players. It has, however, had its share of Olympic wrestlers, Nordic skiers and soccer players. Natalia Levchenkova placed eighth in biathlon at the 2006 Winter Olympics.At the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, 23 Moldovan athletes competed, including Albot, the country’s first Olympic tennis player. He beat Teymuraz Gabashvili of Russia in the first round before losing to Marin Cilic of Croatia. In those Games, one Moldovan, a flat-water canoeist named Oleg Tarnovschi, won the country’s only medal, a bronze that was later stripped because he violated antidoping rules.The next-highest-ranked male player from Moldova, the 36-year-old Roman Borvanov, reached No. 200 back in 2011. Now a teaching pro near Miami, he was in Albot’s players’ box cheering for his countryman on Sunday.“In a way, coming from this country, the results I’ve had, it’s a miracle,” Albot said. Unlike players in countries that host a Grand Slam and have a history of producing star players, he said, he had no Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi in front of him as role models and challenges.“Then you have a goal, you want to be as them,” Albot said. “Me, growing up, I had nobody ahead of me except the guy ranked 200. I wanted to be as him, better than him. But as soon as I got to 190, then what? I didn’t know how to go higher. I didn’t have someone to ask how to get there, to go to for advice. I had to build my game by myself.”When Albot was 6, his father, Vladimir, saw a tennis match on television and decided he wanted his only child to play the sport. Vladimir Albot was able to arrange for his son to train at a school that specialized in tennis — a government-funded academy near the family’s home in Chisinau, the Moldovan capital. The club has eight outdoor red-clay courts and two indoor courts. Until recently, those courts were made of wooden planks, but they have been converted to a hardcourt surface.Though his parents were of modest means — Radu still lives with them in the two-room apartment they own — Vladimir traveled with Radu to junior tournaments while his mother, Svetlana, stayed home to work in her dental therapy practice. Vladimir sold some property he owned to fund his son’s travel.Rather than spend money on hotel rooms, the pair would often sleep on mattresses inside gyms connected to the clubs where Radu competed, Albot said. Whenever Radu was offered a chance to share a room with another competitor, his father would pitch a tent for himself in the tournament parking lot.At 13, Albot was playing in Germany, and he met Jimmy Oganezov, a local businessman from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia who had become a tennis coach. Oganezov invited Albot to spend the summer living and training with him in Wiesbaden. That summer turned into more than a dozen summers, and the training convinced Albot that he could have a career as a professional tennis player.Moldova’s tennis federation generates little sponsorship money for its players, Albot said.“It’s a little disappointing because in some countries, like the U.S. and France, they get so much help, like sponsors and wild cards,” said Albot, who has a German manager and one sponsorship deal, with Yonex for rackets, clothing and shoes.“I was not the spoiled kid who got millions at 19 years old,” he said, “but, on the other hand, maybe that’s what makes me stronger.”Albot had a 12-23 record in tour-level matches last year, including a semifinal finish in Metz, France. This year he has a 10-4 record in five tournaments, including a semifinal finish in Montpellier, France, and the title in Delray Beach. He will next play the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, Calif., and in Miami.When his playing career is over, Albot would like to return to Moldova and help build the next generation of tennis players. He knows it won’t be easy.The country is among the poorest in Europe, and Sunday’s election has not delivered a conclusive result. There have been accusations of fraud that further threaten the country’s efforts to stabilize.Still, Albot has hope.“I don’t want to finish my career and see that tennis is dead in my country,” he said, adding, “I want to walk into every tournament and see the Moldovan flag flying.”"
"Miami Open: Roger Federer and John Isner Fend Off Phenoms to Reach Final - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — By reaching the semifinals of the Miami Open, the Canadian youngsters Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov achieved something that Roger Federer and John Isner never managed.Federer, for all his obvious and precocious tennis talents, never made it to this late a stage of a Masters 1000 event in singles as a teenager. Isner was still a student-athlete at the University of Georgia in his late teens.But neither Auger-Aliassime, 18, nor Shapovalov, 19, was able to make the next leap on Friday as Isner and Federer took turns holding back youth on the temporary center court at Hard Rock Stadium.Federer, 37, and Isner, 33, will now play an old-guard final on Sunday.On Friday afternoon, Isner was opportunistic in his 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4) victory against the silken Auger-Aliassime. In the evening, Federer was brilliant in his 6-2, 6-4 demolition of Shapovalov, a flashy left-hander with a one-handed backhand who grew up idolizing Federer and now has a much clearer understanding of what it is like to face him.“I just think he has every shot mastered,” Shapovalov said. “When he needs a shot, he’s going to make it. He’s going to go for it. He’s going to make it. I don’t think he has any weaknesses. That’s why he’s the G.O.A.T,” the greatest of all time.Federer has had more vulnerable moments in his career and even one this month when Dominic Thiem, another younger man with a forceful one-handed backhand, defeated him to win the title in Indian Wells on March 17.But Federer has been in a very fine patch of form, successfully rebounding from his defeat to yet another member of the new wave, Stefanos Tsitsipas, in the fourth round of this year’s Australian Open.Since then, Federer is 15-1, all on hardcourts.Auger-Aliassime is already quite a tennis package: explosive from the baseline, comfortable at the net and smooth on the move as well as in the interview room, where he can reflect in French or English.On Friday, in the biggest match of his career, the Canadian qualifier acted his age only when it came time to close out a set.Isner, 15 years his senior, has long been one of the game’s supreme servers. But it was Auger-Aliassime’s own serve that proved his undoing.Up by 5-4 and serving for the first set, Auger-Aliassime produced his first three double faults of the match and lost his edge.“For sure, nerves,” Auger-Aliassime said. “It was like I caught a virus or something.”Up by 5-3 and serving for the second set, he double faulted and knocked a midcourt forehand swing volley into the tape on break point.He was soon back in another tiebreaker with Isner, for whom tiebreakers are as natural a habitat as a swamp is to a gator.Isner has played 49 sets this year. More than half (26) have ended in tiebreakers, a reflection of his phenomenal serve and his limitations as a returner.Though Isner had a losing record in 2019 tiebreakers before this tournament, he has gone 9-0 in the Miami Open.“I’m just finding myself pretty calm in those situations; maybe it’s a little bit mental,” Isner said. “I’m just definitely playing my best tennis when I’ve been in that situation this week. There is no doubt.”Isner’s defeat of Auger-Aliassime put him one victory from defending the most significant title of his career. Isner won this Masters 1000 tournament last season, when it was played about 20 miles south of Miami Gardens, on the upscale island of Key Biscayne and with a permanent main stadium.This year, the tournament moved to the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.“A completely different feel than last year, obviously,” Isner said.There are clear benefits to the shift in site: more spacious and luxurious facilities for fans and players; a less congested commute; a fine vibe on the outside courts despite complaints about insufficient seating. Above all there is the fact that this event, traditionally one of the most prestigious outside the four Grand Slam events, has remained in the United States and in the tennis hotbed of South Florida rather than being moved outside the country, which has been the case for other United States-based tournaments in the past 20 years.But the downside for now is that the main stadium often has a low-energy atmosphere, and though ticket sales have been brisk, fewer than half of the seats were occupied when Isner and Auger-Aliassime began play shortly after 1 p.m.The noise and age gap were more pronounced in the second semifinal. Federer is 37. Shapovalov is 19 and was not even born when Federer played his first main-draw match at the Miami Open in 1999.Federer mentioned that fun fact before the match to his twin daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, who are 9: closer to Shapovalov’s age than their father.“They were like: ‘What? Hold on a second!’ ” Federer said. “I did the calculation, and they were like, ‘So this guy is really young?’ ”Federer responded by telling them he was “really old,” but he certainly did not move like it against Shapovalov, who had practiced with him but never played against him in earnest.Federer improvised and covered the corners impressively, slashing forehand and backhand winners and hitting deft, precise volleys. The only relative disappointment: a first-serve percentage below 50 percent. But Federer made the most of his first serves, winning 91 percent of the points and avoiding being broken.“I think I played very well; I had to,” Federer said. “Because I think when you let Denis play, he’s got some serious power and he gets the rhythm going and he can really put you in some uncomfortable situations.”So, in a very different vein, can Isner."
"An Amateur’s Hour - The New York Times
One recent morning, Jack Ming Jie Lin, a Columbia University tennis player, informed his chemistry professor that he needed to reschedule Tuesday night’s lab because he had another engagement.“Look,” he said he told his professor, “I have a very important match Feb. 12 and I understand that we’re supposed to have lab session that Tuesday night, but unfortunately, I can’t make it that night.”Instead of chemistry class, Lin, a 19-year-old sophomore, will be playing his first ATP Tour main-draw match, at the New York Open at Nassau Coliseum. Lin earned a wild card into the first round of the professional event by winning a college invitational in November at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Thirty-two players from 16 New York-area universities, including Army, Cornell, Princeton and St. John’s, competed in the tournament, where Lin beat Alafia Ayeni of Cornell, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 7-6 (5), in a final that lasted three and a half hours.Lin’s appearance at the New York Open is a rare opportunity for an amateur to test himself against the pros.“The Knicks can never play a team like St. John’s in a game that actually counts,” said Peter Lebedevs, the assistant tournament director for the New York Open. “In this, it is the pros playing a collegiate player, and it counts for both of them. For a kid like Jack, it’s an opportunity to get points and to get started on a potential pro career after his college or during the summer.”A native of Markham, Ontario, Lin ended the fall at No. 4 in the collegiate doubles rankings with his playing partner, William Matheson, and is No. 40 in singles. He helped Columbia reach the round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament last season after the Lions won the Ivy League for the fifth year in a row. He owns victories over the current pros Taylor Fritz of the United States and Denis Shapovalov of Canada, but those came in the junior ranks. Shapovalov is ranked No. 25 in the world, and Fritz No. 40.“Obviously seeing them both develop into such big-time players, I don’t think I’m at their level yet with the results that they’ve been having,” said Lin, who grew up near Shapovalov, 19, in the Toronto suburbs. “I’m just more content with my own improvement over every month.”The New York Open will feature many top American player, including John Isner, Frances Tiafoe, Steve Johnson and Sam Querrey. The former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt is playing doubles, as are Bob and Mike Bryan.Lin will play a qualifier on Tuesday, and if he wins, he would face Johnson, ranked 34th. Some of Lin’s Columbia teammates want him to face a top player to see how he matches up.“I want to watch Jack play against one of the high-caliber guys to see the difference between the ATP guys and the level in college,” said the junior Jackie Tang, who plays for the Hong Kong Davis Cup team in addition to competing for Columbia. “I think he’ll do well because I don’t think the gap is that big. I think it’s just the experience and the knowledge of how to play certain points correctly.”John McEnroe, who played a year at Stanford, has been a supporter of college tennis, pointing out that top-10 players like Isner and Kevin Anderson have had pro success at older ages after maturing while playing college tennis. Most recently, Danielle Collins, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion at Virginia, advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open at 25.Lin said: “Honestly, I think college tennis is the best it’s ever been. There are so many transitional players playing at such a high level.”Lin’s mother, Sally Yi, is set to come from Toronto, and many of Lin’s coaches and teammates plan to root him on as well. “I love these play-in formats where it’s not just arbitrarily granting a wild card to somebody,” said the former American star Andy Roddick, who kicked off the tournament on Saturday with an exhibition match against Jim Courier. “It’s a good story that somebody came in and earned it and this is what you get for your troubles.“What’s better than being able to work your way into the matches that you dream about?”Roddick joked that he would advise Lin not to take the prize money so that he can remain an amateur. Lin has not planned that far ahead.“Obviously, playing the event’s not really about the prize money,” he said. “It’s just more about getting the opportunity to play in front of everybody on such a big stage and play against the top guys on the ATP level just to assess what my level is.”At 5-foot-11, Lin is short for a sport where more than half of the men’s top-15 players are at least 6-4. But he is a shotmaker and is working on becoming more aggressive by coming to net more. Lin, who hopes to someday be a top-100 player on the ATP Tour, considers himself part of the rising wave of Canadian players that includes Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime. He played for Canada’s Davis Cup team, but opted to come to the United States to focus on academics and tennis.“In Canada, there are a lot of great universities there too, but they kind of lack the competition in tennis of playing in the States,” he said. “Playing N.C.A.A. tennis, it allows me to continue developing my game and obviously at the same time pursue my academic goals.”Balancing the two sets of goals has been a battle. The men’s tennis team as a whole carries a 3.74 grade point average, and Lin does not want to let his teammates down.“There’s a lot of things going on, but he’s managing,” said Bid Goswami, in his 37th season as the Columbia tennis coach. “He doesn’t want to be left behind in his studies. He had a really good last two semesters.”As for that chemistry lab, Lin suggested to his professor that he move it to Wednesday night, but if he wins on Tuesday, he won’t be able to make that session, either. He’ll be back on the court playing his second-round match at the New York Open.In fact, he would have several schedule conflicts to manage. The Columbia team is flying to Chicago on Wednesday for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association national championships, which begin Friday. “If Jack wins his first match on Tuesday night and misses our flight to Chicago for national indoors,” the Columbia assistant Howard Endelman said, “that’s a good problem to have.”"
"Will Naomi Osaka Pick Japanese Citizenship or American? Her Deadline to Choose Is Looming - The New York Times
TOKYO — If anyone can stir Japanese national pride at the moment, it is Naomi Osaka.The world’s No. 1-ranked player in women’s tennis, Ms. Osaka is among the biggest stars in Japan, splashed across television programs and advertisements for Nissan cars and Citizen watches. As a mixed-race person, she has also helped prompt a discussion about how Japanese see their country.But a looming deadline — Ms. Osaka’s 22nd birthday in October — has raised the question of whether she can continue to represent Japan on the international tennis circuit, where she has given the country bragging rights on the world sports stage.Ms. Osaka, whose mother is Japanese and father is Haitian-American, has citizenship in both Japan and the United States. Under Japanese law, dual citizens must choose between the two nationalities by the time they turn 22.That legal clause has left fans and commentators trying to guess whether Ms. Osaka will pick citizenship in Japan, the country of her birth, or the United States, where she has lived since she was a young child.The choice facing Ms. Osaka comes as Japan is under pressure to loosen its entrenched insularity. Japan has long prized racial purity, seeing a largely homogeneous population as crucial to social cohesion. But with the country’s population declining and employers increasingly desperate for workers, its legislature passed a law in December to admit more guest workers, starting this month.Ms. Osaka’s case, along with the new influx of foreigners, could exert new pressure on the government to begin to bring Japanese citizenship laws in line with those in the roughly three-quarters of countries, including the United States, that allow dual citizenship.For now, though, Ms. Osaka has a decision to make. When asked by reporters which nationality she intended to choose, she responded with trademark feistiness.“I’m pretty sure it’s obvious,” she said at a news conference following the China Open in October. “I’m playing for Japan. Not to be disrespectful or anything, but I don’t really get where the conclusion that it’s a hard choice for me or anything comes from.”Still, it might be hard to imagine Ms. Osaka giving up her American citizenship to keep playing under the Japanese flag. And in reality, she may not have to. Legal experts say the Japanese government rarely enforces the law requiring citizens to choose between nationalities.The Justice Ministry estimates that about 890,000 Japanese citizens may also hold foreign passports, and the government has never revoked Japanese citizenship from anyone who, like Ms. Osaka, was granted citizenship at birth. (Japanese citizens who voluntarily naturalize in another country automatically lose their Japanese citizenship.)But some analysts warn that because of Ms. Osaka’s celebrity, it would be difficult for the government to quietly give her a pass on dual citizenship.“I think for the government it is a problem if she openly carries on having two passports,” said Sachiko Horiguchi, associate professor of anthropology at Temple University’s Tokyo campus. “Because that means the public would know that the law isn’t really enforced. I don’t think the government wants to admit that or the public to know that.”Three years ago, when Renho Murata, whose father is from Taiwan, ran as the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party, right-wing critics attacked her because she had not formally relinquished her Taiwanese citizenship.Partly in response to the frenzy over Ms. Murata, Kimi Onoda, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who was born in the United States to an American father and a Japanese mother, formally renounced her American citizenship.Ms. Osaka’s multicultural background has challenged Japan’s notions of national identity, and she has become the most prominent mixed-race and mixed-nationality figure in a country where only one in 50 children born each year has a foreign parent. Though she is not fluent in Japanese, she has captivated the country with her whimsical remarks to the news media, as well as her humility in victory.Her parents decided when she was young that she and her sister, who also played, would represent Japan, partly because the American tennis federation showed them little attention.Anticipating Ms. Osaka’s citizenship choice, Michio Ushioda, a former columnist for The Mainichi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, and a professor at Teikyo University in Tokyo, said on Twitter that Japan would fall into a national funk if she elected American citizenship over Japanese.“The disappointment of the Japanese at that time would be great,” Mr. Ushioda wrote in a tweet that only select followers could view, even suggesting that Japan’s current administration would collapse if Ms. Osaka competed for the United States in the Olympics.Under International Olympic Committee rules, competitors must be nationals of the countries they represent. Similarly, under International Tennis Federation rules, Ms. Osaka could not play for Japan if she gave up her Japanese citizenship.Legal experts say Japanese law provides a loophole through which dual citizens can effectively retain both nationalities. The law requires only that a Japanese citizen “endeavor to renounce” foreign nationality, a phrase that can provide just enough wiggle room for citizens to hold on to an extra passport.“Many people misunderstand the law and feel threatened that they have to choose a nationality,” said Yasuhiro Okuda, a law professor at Chuo University.Until 1985, Japan granted citizenship only to children whose fathers were Japanese. When it changed the law — a move it made under pressure from international critics who said the rules discriminated against women — the government added the clause stipulating that children with dual citizenship would have to choose between their passports by the time they turned 22.Analysts say Japan’s law makes little sense in a modern world filled with multicultural citizens like Ms. Osaka.“It goes against Japan’s efforts to recruit and retain global talent,” said Erin Chung, a professor of East Asian politics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. “If you basically maintain the spirit of the current nationality act, that will be a huge deterrent for athletes and other members of what’s called the global talent pool to stay in Japan.”For older generations, opening Japan to a pool of newly naturalized citizens could generate a considerable political backlash.But younger Japanese are growing more accustomed to living and working with international neighbors and colleagues.“Young people in their 20s now are much more familiar with foreigners or so-called ‘hafu,’” said Satoko Takeda, a visiting researcher at Osaka University of Economics and Law, using the Japanese term, from the English word “half,” to describe those of mixed-race descent like Ms. Osaka. “They are different from previous generations. I think there is hope.”"
"Bianca Andreescu Completes a Stunning Run to the Indian Wells Title - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — As part of her morning routine, the Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu finds a quiet place and visualizes success, big success.“It’s crazy to think that it became a reality today,” she said after the roars had faded on Sunday afternoon.Not so crazy if you observed all the shots and grit that Andreescu had to summon under duress to defeat tennis elder after tennis elder in the desert and win one of the most prestigious titles in the sport.But it was certainly far-fetched when you considered her lack of experience at this level and the quality of the players she had to outhit and outwit, including the three-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 Angelique Kerber, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in Sunday’s final.Andreescu, 18, is the first wild card to win the BNP Paribas Open.“Hopefully, this moment can be a great inspiration for many young athletes because, like I always say, if you believe in yourself, anything is possible,” Andreescu said during the award ceremony.While she won her first tour title, Roger Federer was unable to win his 101st, losing to Dominic Thiem, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, in the men’s final later Sunday. Thiem, the No. 7 seed, reached the French Open final last year, but this Masters 1000 title was his most significant victory.He earned it — just barely — by putting his huge baseline power and flashy one-handed backhand to work and by breaking the 37-year-old Federer at 5-5 in the third set and then holding firm.“I think it’s not my right to congratulate you; you have 88 more titles than me,” Thiem said to Federer, who is, nonetheless, now 2-3 against the young Austrian.Kerber, age 31 and seeded eighth, was unable to prevail against Andreescu despite a huge edge in experience. This was Kerber’s 29th final on tour, and only Andreescu’s second. Kerber had won more than $27 million in career prize money; Andreescu had won just $350,000.Kerber also had an apparent physical edge in the final phase of a grueling match, played in 80-degree weather. Andreescu arrived on court with her right shoulder and right forearm taped after winning six matches en route to the final.“My shoulder has just been really, really tight,” she said. “That was more for prevention.”She required more treatment on her arm early in the third set, but despite looking bone weary between points, crouching down and stretching repeatedly, she found the will and, above all, the patterns and talent to finish off Kerber on her fourth match point.When it was over, Kerber kissed the teenager on both cheeks. Andreescu then crossed to the opposite side of the net, kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back, her arms and legs splayed as she basked in the sun and in one of the game’s most unexpected great performances.Though most Canadians at home could not watch the match on terrestrial television — only streaming was available outside of Quebec — her compatriots definitely noticed.“Bianca Andreescu just made history. Congratulations,” Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, posted on Twitter shortly after her victory.Women’s tennis, which is in a deeply compelling phase, has had a number of breakthrough performances of late, including Naomi Osaka’s run to the title at Indian Wells a year ago as an unseeded player, when she was 20. That presaged Osaka’s victories at the United States Open and the Australian Open and her rise to No. 1, where she remains.Andreescu was asked if she saw that as inspiration.“No pressure,” she answered quickly, smiling.Her questioner apologized.“It’s totally fine,” Andreescu said. “Yeah, it’s definitely inspiration seeing her claim the trophy last year, and winning two Grand Slams right after that has been amazing to see. But I don’t really want to focus on the future right now. I just want to enjoy this moment, because I don’t want to take anything for granted. You never know what next week brings. I just want to savor this.”Next week will bring the Miami Open, where she has a first-round match scheduled against Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania, the player she had to rally to defeat in the first round in three sets at Indian Wells.“She’s not seeded and won’t get the extra day of rest,” her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, said. “So of course it’s a challenge to go right to Miami with very little rest and with the emotions and everything. But it’s like that, and you have to go with it. It’s the learning curve and the job.”Andreescu, the only child of Romanian immigrants, is the youngest woman to win at Indian Wells since 17-year-old Serena Williams did so in 1999.“You just played amazing the whole tournament, so you really deserved to win the title here,” Kerber told Andreescu in her postmatch on-court remarks.Andreescu did not emerge from obscurity. She was a highly regarded junior player who won the prestigious Les Petits As title in France, and though she was not the dominant junior at the Grand Slam level in 2016 and 2017, she did win two Grand Slam girls doubles titles.In January, Andreescu upset Caroline Wozniacki, then No. 3 in the world, and Venus Williams to reach the final of the tour event in Auckland, New Zealand, and then qualified for the Australian Open, where she won her first Grand Slam singles match.But her run in the California desert was still a huge leap, and the element of surprise certainly worked in her favor. The last six of her seven matches were against players she had never faced on tour: Dominika Cibulkova, Stefanie Voegele, Wang Qiang, Garbiñe Muguruza, Elina Svitolina and Kerber.The tour’s veterans will now have a better idea of what to expect, but it will not be easy to identify areas of weakness.Andreescu has a remarkably complete game for a player of any age, much less an 18-year-old. Despite struggling physically at times against Svitolina in their semifinal and again versus Kerber, Andreescu was still able to display her full palette of all-court skills.“I think she has a tennis that is really complete, and on the mental side, she’s a warrior,” said Bruneau, who helped her on the mental side with some well-chosen words on coaching visits in the second and third sets on Sunday.Andreescu can bang groundstrokes at a world-class clip or change pace abruptly with slice. She also can hit rolling, off-speed, angled winners from either wing that might well become her trademark. Time and again, she kept Kerber, a counterpuncher who thrives on consistent pace, from settling into a rhythm.Andreescu can attack the net or defend in the corners with her foot speed and excellent footwork. She has a strong first serve and, perhaps more important in the return-focused women’s game, a solid second serve that is difficult to attack.Andreescu also likes the drop shot, which can be a joy and a curse — as was evident against Kerber. Andreescu hit some exquisite winners and some tight, untimely errors with the risky shot. But after failing to convert three match points on her serve at 5-3 in the third set, she roared back after the changeover to break Kerber’s serve for the victory.Ranked No. 60 before the tournament began, Andreescu will be 24th on Monday. She has more than quadrupled her career prize money, earning $1,354,010 for her victory.Not bad, given that she still does not have a high-school degree, which she is trying to complete online.“I’m on that, but it’s hard because after practice, that’s the last thing I want to do,” she said. “I’m just so tired, but I believe knowledge is power.”"
"Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, Leads Youth Movement at the Miami Open - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The story of Juan Ponce de León searching for a fountain of youth in Florida may be apocryphal, but this week at the men’s event of the Miami Open, there seems to be something revitalizing in the water.Felix Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, is the youngest man to reach the semifinals in the tournament’s history. His compatriot and friend Denis Shapovalov, 19, will join him in the semifinals after beating the American Frances Tiafoe, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-2, in a quarterfinal Thursday evening.Auger-Aliassime, ranked 57th, booked his spot in the semifinals with a 7-6 (3), 6-2 win over 11th-seeded Borna Coric on Wednesday night. Coric, 22, was eight years younger than the next-oldest quarterfinalist, but still far more experienced than Auger-Aliassime, who is in the main draw of a Masters event for just the fifth time.“Playing Borna, who’s been established for a few years now, I definitely didn’t expect to win,” Auger-Aliassime said, adding that he was especially surprised with how he was able to control the second set after a grueling opening set that lasted more than an hour.“I felt like I had margin over him, had a bit of an edge,” he added. “I just felt really comfortable out there from the first balls.”Excitement and expectations preceded Auger-Aliassime years before he was ready for the professional tour. He was a highly touted junior by the time he turned 15; his matches on small courts at the 2015 United States Open were swarmed with scouts and sponsors.His potential, evident then, is clearer now. Like many in his generation, Auger-Aliassime is comfortable on all parts of the court; he hit a particularly convincing sliding forehand volley winner to extend his lead to 2-0 in the second set.Shapovalov and Tiafoe relished knifing sharply angled drop volley winners during their match Thursday, exchanging a high-five at the net after one particularly sublime shot by Shapovalov.The on-court flair extends to the normally rote postmatch rituals, too. Shapovalov celebrated a win in Indian Wells, Calif., by rapping several bars in his on-court interview. When Auger-Aliassime signs his initials on the TV camera lens after a win, it at first appears as if he is writing the name of a fraternity someone his age might be pledging: Gamma Lambda Lambda — “ΓΛΛ” — before striking through the letters to create a stylized “FAA.”Ranked 182nd a year ago, Auger-Aliassime, who grew up in Montreal, broke into the top 100 after reaching the final of the ATP tournament in Rio de Janeiro in February. He is poised to be ranked 33rd on Monday and would crack the top 20 if he wins the title on Sunday.Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov are the second and third teenagers to reach the Miami Open quarterfinals since 2007, when Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic did (Alexander Zverev did it in 2017). Murray, Djokovic and the eight teenage boys to achieve the feat before them went on to reach the No. 1 ranking and win at least one Grand Slam title. (A 17-year-old Rafael Nadal first beat Roger Federer in Miami, in 2004. He reached the final the next year.)“Obviously it’s a privilege to be compared to all these great players,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I think it just shows that I’m doing good things, I’m on the right track.“But, yeah, I think I’m seeing the long term, and right now I’m just enjoying every day, enjoying every match, because you never know what’s going to happen next.”Auger-Aliassime’s success in Miami comes on the heels of another surprising run by an 18-year-old Canadian: Bianca Andreescu’s title last week in Indian Wells.As women’s tennis is being lifted by the breakthroughs of young players like Andreescu and Naomi Osaka, men’s tennis has been eagerly awaiting new blood as players in their 30s like Djokovic, Federer and Nadal continue to dominate the tour.“You have a lot of newcomers with talent gunning for them, and every week it feels like someone new is making a breakthrough and playing well,” said Shapovalov. “I think it’s really healthy to see a couple new stars in the game, and the fans get to watch something new, other than the top four.”The ATP began a campaign few years ago to highlight its “Next Gen” players; the results have been mixed. While four quarterfinalists in Miami are 22 or younger, the four others are 30 or older.Zverev, now 21, is ranked third, but has struggled in Grand Slam tournaments. Stefanos Tsitsipas, 20, has risen to No. 10, spurred by a run to the Australian Open semifinals that included a win over Federer.Shapovalov had his breakthrough moment at the 2017 Rogers Cup in Montreal, beating Nadal, ranked No. 1 at the time, en route to reaching the semifinals as a 17-year-old. He then reached the fourth round at the U.S. Open.Tiafoe, 21, was in his first Masters quarterfinal, backing up his quarterfinal run at the Australian Open in January.There is hope that this tournament is further evidence that reinforcements are finally ready to replenish the men’s tour. Tiafoe believes it’s already happening.“I wouldn’t say we’re ‘Next Gen,’” Tiafoe said. “I think we’re definitely here, knocking on the door to do some good things.”Auger-Aliassime will face seventh-seeded John Isner, 33, on Friday for a spot in the final. Auger-Aliassime’s record against top players is limited but spotless: he is 5-0 against top-20 opponents.How Auger-Aliassime’s form will translate into Grand Slam tennis played over best-of-five sets is still an open question. At last year’s U.S. Open, his only main-draw appearance at a major, he retired in the third set of his first-round match against Shapovalov because of heart palpitations.Federer, 37, remains the oldest player in the draw. He will play his quarterfinal match against Kevin Anderson, 32, on Thursday night.Federer turned 19 the day Auger-Aliassime was born. Federer said he enjoyed seeing members of the young generation square off against one another, particularly savoring the fourth-round match between Shapovalov and Tsitsipas, which was decided in a third-set tiebreaker.“I loved seeing them slug it out, and I’m sure they are going to have big matches down the road,” Federer said. “I like when they also have to play each other a little bit, because they don’t look across the net and see a guy ranked whatever it is. It’s just another guy they know from the juniors, and ‘I’m just going to beat you up now.’”WOMEN’S SEMIFINALS In a women’s semifinal that was delayed by five hours because of intermittent rain on Thursday afternoon, 12th-seeded Ashleigh Barty reached the biggest final of her career, beating 21st-seeded Anett Kontaveit 6-3, 6-3.In the final, Barty will face fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova, who denied the No. 2 seed, Simona Halep, a win that would have returned her to the top world ranking. Pliskova won, 7-5, 6-1. Barty, 22, will make her debut in the WTA Top 10 on Monday."
"Illness Knocks Serena Williams Out at Indian Wells - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — For the first three games, Serena Williams was in a deep, irresistible groove: pounding serves and ground strokes as Garbiñe Muguruza watched the winners zoom by.Who could have known, as Williams took a quick 3-0 lead, that she would not win another game on Sunday?With Williams visibly hampered, increasingly slow on her feet and unable to hit serves at full power, Muguruza reeled off seven straight games. Muguruza was up to a 6-3, 1-0 lead before Williams walked to her chair instead of changing ends, sitting down heavily and then retiring from this third-round match at the BNP Paribas Open.The WTA Tour announced that the reason for Williams’s retirement was a “viral illness.”“Before the match, I did not feel great, and then it just got worse with every second: extreme dizziness and extreme fatigue,” Williams said in a statement released by the tournament. “By the score, it might have looked like I started well, but I was not feeling at all well physically.”Muguruza, a tall, powerful Spaniard who is seeded 20th, said, “We played many times, and it’s always supertough and superexciting, and it’s never good to see someone not feeling well on the court.”The retirement was the latest on-court setback for the 37-year-old Williams, who has had some remarkable results since returning to the tour last year after childbirth but has yet to win a title.This was her second tournament of 2019 and only her third event in six months. Last September, she reached the United States Open final before losing her cool and the match to Naomi Osaka.In January, she quickly hit plenty of high notes again on her way to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, where she rolled her left ankle while holding a 5-1, 40-30 lead in the third set against Karolina Pliskova.Pliskova went on to save four match points in all. She won the next six games and the match, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.It was an unprecedented Grand Slam collapse for Williams, one of the supreme competitors in the history of women’s tennis.But Williams returned to Florida and the practice court and then returned to action at Indian Wells on Friday, playing one of the finest matches of her comeback, defeating Victoria Azarenka, 7-5, 6-3.“We’re both moms, and we know how hard it is and how hard it’s been for us to come back, you know, and starting literally from scratch and fighting our way back,” Williams said. “It’s been an arduous road, and I think we both really appreciate both of our efforts to do the best that we can do.”When Williams returned to Court One to face Muguruza, she was soon striking the ball as cleanly and convincingly as she had against Azarenka.“I thought that match with Vika was such a high level of tennis from both of them,” said Kathy Rinaldi, the United States Fed Cup captain. “And today, Serena started off carrying on. It was coming off the racket, easy power and very consistent.”It was their first meeting since Muguruza defeated Williams to win her first major singles title at the 2016 French Open.But Williams, back in the top 10 and seeded 10th, could not sustain her remarkable level. Muguruza raised her own, fighting to hold serve in the fourth game, breaking Williams in the next game and then ripping a series of backhand down-the-line winners to hold serve at love and even the match at 3-3.“I think she started playing well right away, with her serve, with her shots, being very dominating,” Muguruza said. “I had to adapt a little bit my position in the court, the way I was hitting. And it took me a few games to kind of do it. Once I did it, I felt much more comfortable to be able to release my tennis.”Williams started the seventh game with an off-balance double fault into the net and began hitting first serves consistently below 100 miles per hour. She double faulted again later in the game and barely moved as Muguruza hit a forehand winner to go ahead, 4-3.Williams then walked very slowly to her chair and looked frustrated on the first point of the next game, taking a huge, angry cut at a forehand return that she hit into the net.“At the end of the first set, I felt maybe she wasn’t feeling well, yeah,” Muguruza said.Williams soon provided confirmation. After losing the set, she called for a trainer and was eventually surrounded by the tour supervisor Donna Kelso, the trainer Paige Kensrue and a tournament physician. Though Kensrue arrived on court with a blood-pressure cuff, she did not take a reading on Williams and no official medical timeout was taken.After extended discussion, Williams returned to the court to start the second set but did not win another point as Muguruza held serve at love.One of Williams’s signatures is that after the first game of a set, she does not change ends on the chair umpire’s side of the net, crossing over on the opposite side without approaching her own seat. But she changed her routine this time, heading straight for her chair and then retiring.It was only Williams’s third midmatch retirement since 2009. Her next scheduled event is the Miami Open later this month.“I think Serena always has the confidence,” Rinaldi said. “Look at her record coming back from having baby Olympia: two finals of Grand Slams. I think she knows what she is capable of. Self-belief, I don’t think that’s an issue. Obviously today was a little bit of a setback, but I think since she came back that she has gotten better and better and stronger.”"
"Danielle Collins Rolls Right Past Kerber and Into the Australian Open Quarterfinals - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Danielle Collins, who had not won a match at a Grand Slam tournament before this year, pummeled second-seeded Angelique Kerber in the fourth round on Sunday, sealing the most stunning result of the Australian Open with a 6-0, 6-2 victory that took just 55 minutes to complete.Collins commanded the match from the beginning, dictating play by aggressively attacking, particularly with her two-handed backhand. She hit 29 winners in the match, compared to just six for Kerber.Kerber, a three-time Grand Slam champion from Germany, had few solutions for Collins and was unable to use her counterpunching to wrest control of the match at any point.“It was completely not my day,” Kerber said. “I was not playing the tennis that I can play. She played really well. I think she played one of her best matches, to be honest. She hit, yeah, every ball in the court.”After losing the first set in just 20 minutes, Kerber walked off the court of Margaret Court Arena in an apparent effort to change the momentum of the match, leaving Collins grinning as she waited.Kerber won the first two points after she returned, playing with a renewed purpose and shouts of encouragement to herself, but Collins again announced her presence in the match by screaming, “Come on!” back at Kerber after hitting a drop-shot winner on the third point.Collins’s pugnacious attitude is well known in tennis, and something she readily acknowledges and embraces, calling it “just part of the deal with me” on court.“I mean, you all know: I’m my own person; I’m feisty,” she said. “I love making it kind of a war. If somebody wants to get in my face on my unforced errors, I have no problem getting right back at them and making it a feisty match. I love that, embrace it. I love when things get competitive.”The tenacity in her tennis extends to off-court pursuits as well.“Even karaoke — I don’t have a good voice, but I always try to do the best at whatever I’m doing,” said Collins, a 25-year-old Floridian. “If I’m not, I still tell myself I’m the best. You’ve got to believe it, right?”That unshakability was clear as Collins closed out her victory. Kerber broke in the first game of the second set after their verbal exchange, but Collins broke back in the next game, and then pulled ahead of Kerber for good when she broke again for 4-2.Mat Cloer, one of Collins’s coaches, said that she had played “pretty flawless” in the first set and had done what she needed to retain the momentum.“You knew after the first set that she was going to come out and make that second push,” Cloer said of Kerber. “And she did, and Danielle handled it really, really well. She showed great composure, but also didn’t back down. She lost the first game of the second set, but she showed that she was a little fiery at Angie.”He added: “I think that allowed her to show, ‘I’m still here, and I’m going to fight this through,’ which I think didn’t make it easy for Angie to get out of it — and Danielle just kept going.”Collins, a two-time national champion in singles for the University of Virginia, is the first collegiate player to reach the quarterfinals of women’s singles at a Grand Slam event since Lisa Raymond at the 2004 Australian Open.“I think going to college helped me develop myself as a person,” Collins said. “I really know who I am, the type of person I am, what I want, what I want to do with my life, what I want to do with my tennis.“I have other interests and passions aside from tennis. I’m able to relax a little bit more, maybe, than some other people because they’ve kind of just been doing tennis their whole life, haven’t really ventured out much.”Collins did her homework before the biggest victory of her career, watching footage of Kerber’s matches.“I had a clear mind-set of what I was going to do,” Collins said. “From the very first point, I showed her that I wasn’t going to let her into the match, that I was going to dictate the entire way through. I stuck to my game plan. It clearly worked out well for me, pretty much smooth sailing throughout the entire thing. I was just feeling really great.”Collins has been a quick study in the elite levels of professional tennis. Ranked 162nd a year ago, she broke through with a run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last March, beating Venus Williams en route.Collins, now No. 35 in the rankings, will face 44th-ranked Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Tuesday for a spot in the semifinals after Pavlyuchenkova upset No. 5 Sloane Stephens, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3. Simon Goffin, Pavlyuchenkova’s coach, said he knew Collins could rise to the occasion of an opponent like Kerber.“She really likes these big stadiums, to play against the seeds, to be a bit of an underdog,” Goffin said of Collins. “She really likes this. She’s a tough challenger. She likes a big challenge, she likes a fight, so I’m not surprised.”Collins did not moderate her hopes for the next match.“Hopefully, another amazing match of tennis for me,” she said in her on-court interview, one of several answers that drew startled gasps from audience members not used to such unapologetic self-assuredness.Collins said she was animated by antagonism.“I just love competition,” she said. “Whether people are for me or against me, I’m not really fazed by it. I love it. Either way. I kind of like it more when people cheer against me sometimes because I want to get them back, prove them wrong.”Despite Collins’s ability to build up her ranking, success at Grand Slams did not come until this tournament. Her first-round win over 14th-seeded Julia Görges was her first main draw victory at a Grand Slam event.In her news conference, Collins pointed out that her draws in her three previous Grand Slam matches had been far from enviable, as she opened against a top-20 opponent each time.“I did everything I could in those situations,” Collins said of her losses to Caroline Wozniacki, Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka. “Sometimes it just doesn’t go the way you want it to. Everybody gets their shot at the pie. Right now I’m certainly getting mine. I’m doing very well. I’m just kind of focused on that.”In her on-court interview after the victory, Collins made it clear that she was confident of further slices of sweet Slam success.“I may not have won a Grand Slam match before this,” she said. “But I’ve got to tell you: I think it’s going to keep happening.”"
"Reintroducing Frances Tiafoe, the New Mr. Upset of the Australian Open - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Sometimes Grand Slam breakthroughs, even for the most hyped and promising tennis players, come when least expected. Consider the case of Frances Tiafoe, the 21-year-old American hopeful who limped into this year’s Australian Open with little to suggest his first week would unfold in the stirring way that it has.An electric talent who has been talked about since his midteens because of his potential and hardscrabble history, Tiafoe, ranked 39th, staggered through the end of last season. Then he went winless in a string of early January exhibition matches in Perth. Six days before this tournament began, he was outgunned at a warm-up tournament in Sydney by the Australian journeyman John Millman.“Perth was terrible,” Tiafoe said. “Sydney was bad.”Buzz? The kind of stirring expectations that surrounded the Federer slayer Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 14th-seeded Greek player, going into Melbourne?Around Tiafoe, there was no buzz.But all that changed over the first week of this tournament, a stretch that Tiafoe, a 6-foot-2 power hitter, capped on a hot Sunday afternoon with a round-of-16 win over Grigor Dimitrov, who was seeded No. 20. The score was 7-5, 7-6 (6), 6-7 (1), 7-5.It was a third straight upset for a player who, entering this tournament, had never won a match at the Australian Open and had been in the draw only once, in 2018. Now, with a surprise win on his 21st birthday, Tiafoe has launched into the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time.“It means the world,” said Tiafoe, known for his unvarnished candor, speaking to a packed crowd at Melbourne Arena after the match.For all the hard work in a match that lasted nearly four hours, he next faces Rafael Nadal, the second seed, who has won the Australian Open once, in 2009. Nadal, of course, will be an overwhelming favorite. But Tiafoe will have a confidence he has never had before, and strong backing from fans.Tiafoe, one of the few black male players in pro tennis, has become a crowd favorite in Melbourne, captivating crowds with his personality, flair-filled game and bare-chested celebrations that have followed each of his three big upsets. (He has made a habit of ripping his shirt off after a win, pounding his chest and his right biceps, and punching the air, a nod to moves made by LeBron James, one of his idols.)“This is crazy man, this is crazy,” Tiafoe said a few hours after the match. His eyes sparkled. He looked as if he were in awe of his accomplishment. He recalled his past. Tiafoe’s parents fled a civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s and settled outside Washington. His father had been a custodian at a public tennis center in College Park, Md., and young Frances and his twin brother learned the game there.In his early teens, Tiafoe promised his family that he would one day become a star tennis player, and take care of everyone.“I obviously wasn’t a normal tennis story,” he said.In the beginning of his career, he said, he had been playing for his family. Not long ago, he bought his mother a house and he is indeed providing his family with a comfortable life. “Now,” he said, “I’m trying to do it for me.”Dimitrov, 27, is a tour stalwart known for his immense talent, long among the world’s top-20 men’s players, and the winner of eight tour titles. But from the start of this match, Tiafoe, who has won just a single title, gave as good as he got.The match turned in the second set tiebreaker. Facing a trio of set points, Tiafoe responded as he has all week — first in his win against Kevin Anderson, one of the tournament favorites, and then over the 35th-ranked Italian veteran Andreas Seppi. He buckled down, kept his chin up and a spring in his step, and scorched a series of winners and error-inducing groundstrokes. Not long afterward, aided by a Dimitrov double fault, the set was his, and soon the match.“In that tiebreak, as much as I was playing better and better, he just kept coming back with good answers,” said Dimitrov, whose own Grand Slam coming out came in 2014, when he lost in the Wimbledon semifinals to the eventual champion, Novak Djokovic.On Sunday, after a match point in which a Dimitrov groundstroke fell into the net, Tiafoe bent over in the moment, hands on his knees, stunned. Who could blame him? He had struggled at the end of last year, losing matches a player of his talent is expected to win.His traveling coach, Zack Evenden, explained that a turn came following the painful defeat two weeks ago to Millman, ranked No. 37, at the Sydney International.“Millman wanted it more,” Evenden said. He recalled Tiafoe realizing that he could learn from the Australian journeyman, who is deeply admired on tour for his doggedness. “Talent is not enough to get you where you want to be. You’ve got to turn up for every single point. You have got to want it, and want it bad.”Tiafoe now goes up against a player who has 17 Gand Slam titles and is perhaps the greatest competitor in tennis history.Nadal “is going to run me like crazy,” Tiafoe said after the match. Then he flashed the self-assurance that comes with a first major tournament breakthrough: “He better get ready.”"
"The Osakas’ Brief Sister Act at the Miami Open - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — It’s a familiar sight to have a top player’s sister in the draw of the Miami Open, where this year Venus and Serena Williams are both competing for a 17th time.But this tournament is the first time at a WTA-level event that top-ranked Naomi Osaka was joined in the singles main draw by her older sister, Mari.Everyone else in women’s tennis is ranked below Naomi Osaka right now, including Mari, 22, who is ranked 338th, and normally plays lower-level events.She received a wild card for this tournament and played her first WTA main draw match on Thursday against another wild card, 205th-ranked Whitney Osuigwe. Osaka acquitted herself well in a 6-2, 6-4 loss.Naomi Osaka, who is 18 months younger than her sister, said that it was “really enjoyable” to have her Mari with her at a tournament, and that she hoped it would be an experience they shared far more in the future.“For me it would be a dream,” Osaka said. “Because I don’t really talk to that many people, and she’s the nicer one in this relationship. It would definitely mean a lot.”Though siblings like the Williamses or Marat Safin and Dinara Safina have risen to the peaks of the sport, siblings with far different career altitudes are more common.Naomi Osaka’s opposite number in the men’s tour, top-ranked Novak Djokovic, had two younger brothers who struggled in the large shadow he cast. Despite receiving many wild cards, Marko Djokovic reached a career-high ranking of No. 571; Djordje Djokovic reached No. 1,463. Marko, 27, now coaches and competes only occasionally, while Djordje, 23, stopped competing in 2015.Novak Djokovic, 31, said that his brothers’ decisions to step back from tennis had come as a relief to him.“I’m glad they’ve decided themselves what they want to do, because in the end of the day it’s something that gives me satisfaction and peace, knowing that they made the decision, not myself or my parents or anybody else,” Djokovic said. “Because in this kind of circumstance, they feel obliged, or they feel pressure that they have to meet the expectations of the other brother or sister. Because if you’re part of the same sport, naturally, everyone will compare you to your other siblings. It’s not ideal, especially if your other sibling is the best in the world.”Siblings of top players have often drafted off that familial fame to get started in their career, but the main draw wild card for Mari Osaka raised many eyebrows around the tournament, considering she was ranked more than 200 spots below the cut for the qualifying draw for this elite event. James Blake, the Miami Open tournament director, said the decision to double the number of Osakas in the draw had been an easy one.“Obviously Naomi is someone that’s accomplished so much, and you want to encourage her sister as well,” Blake said. “You wonder if there’s a lot of talent and she hasn’t had the same opportunities. We know she’ll also be a draw. Naomi has so many fans; Mari is going to hopefully gain some of those fans by association.”Blake, who reached a career-best of No. 4, had a brother, Thomas, who reached 264th — a parallel that he admitted tinted his view.“He got some wild cards, definitely with the Blake name,” James Blake said. “He really appreciated them. Mari has thanked me, her parents have thanked me. They realize that this is a big opportunity for her.”It is rarer for the younger sibling to make a splash on tour first. For most of their childhoods, Mari had dominated her younger sister in practice matches.“Up until I was 15 she was 6-0-ing me, ridiculous,” Naomi said. “I don’t know what happened, maybe finally something clicked in my head, but for sure she was beating me. In the win-loss record, she’s up by like a million or something.”Both entered the qualifying draw of the WTA tournament in Stanford, Calif., in 2014. Naomi, then 16, reached the main draw and then stunned the 2011 United States Open champion, Samantha Stosur, in the first round.“It’s probably the second-best win of my life,” Osaka said after that victory, “the first being when I first beat my sister.”As Naomi continued to soar upward, Mari’s trajectory stalled; her career-best ranking was 280th last May. Before Thursday she had not competed for more than a month because of a right shoulder injury. Her first match this season was a 6-0, 6-0 loss to 471st-ranked Katie Volynets, a far cry from the competitive level she showed on Thursday.Mari Osaka said she was determined to play this tournament, knowing for the past six months that she would be awarded a wild card.“It was just super exciting and new for me,” Mari said of the experience. “I’m super thankful that I actually got it.”She smiled at the mention of her sister’s rise from 70th to first in the rankings since the beginning of last year. “I’m really proud of her,” Mari said.Asked if she was able to focus on her own path or felt she had “big shoes to fill,” Mari said: “My own journey is separate, but of course I tend to compare a little bit, so it’s frustrating. But, you know, not much I can do about that.”Osaka then abruptly broke into tears. She apologized, accepted a moderator’s offer to leave the room to regain her composure, and returned several minutes later.When she returned, she was able to focus on the positives she took from the match.“I played this match with no pain, which I haven’t done in such a long time,” she said. “It feels really good, like I can keep moving forward from here.”"
"Back From Tennis Purgatory, Lucas Pouille Defies Even His Own Expectations - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — At the start of this year’s Australian Open, the French tennis player Lucas Pouille was a man severely overlooked.He had come to Melbourne, after all, on the heels of a 2018 season that dripped with disappointing losses, trying more than anything else to simply recapture a sense of joy on the court.Expectations? Any that existed were extremely slim, Pouille said, as he looked back Wednesday on a tournament that now stands as the most thrilling of his seven-year career. Slim, from those on the outside looking in, he said, and “even from myself.”But in the world of professional tennis, slim expectations can grow Grand Slam fat with remarkable speed. They certainly have this week for Pouille. On Wednesday afternoon at Melbourne Park, the Frenchman moved into his first Grand Slam semifinal with a sharp 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 victory over Milos Raonic of Canada, the lumbering former Wimbledon finalist with the massive serve who was seeded 16th.Pouille, who had never won an Australian Open match before last week, now faces a nearly impossible task. The final is within his reach. But to get there he must beat Novak Djokovic, who currently rules men’s tennis with an iron grip.Not long after Pouille and Raonic left Rod Laver Arena, Djokovic breezed into the final four, his quarterfinal match done in just 52 minutes when the eighth-seeded Kei Nishikori, of Japan, retired with a leg injury. Djokovic led by 6-1, 4-1 at the time, and had never been pushed. It was a gift. A match that short and stress free will help Djokovic, seeking his seventh Australian Open title, keep his body fresh at the stage in this tournament when he most needs it, especially since he had struggled through a bruising, four-set win over Daniil Medvedev earlier this week.Pouille, 24 years old and seeded 28th, burst onto the scene in 2016, with quarterfinal showings at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, where he beat Nadal.Last season, however, was tennis purgatory. True, his ranking did rise briefly to a career-high No. 10 in March. But he also failed to get past the third round of any of the major championships. He lost to players ranked outside the top 100. And as the year ended, he suffered through a string of early tournament defeats.“I lost that joy being on the court,” he said, reflecting on last year after his quarterfinal match, which he won behind strong serving and a steady dose of returns that left the 6-5 Raonic off balance. “For some reason, I don’t know really know why it happened. I t did. You lose one match, two matches, three matches, then you lose confidence.”Searching for a solution, he last month replaced his old coach with Amélie Mauresmo, the 39-year-old former pro who is a hero in France because of her pair of Grand Slam singles titles and because she is the last French player, male of female, to reach world No. 1.Other top male players are coached by a woman, but those female coaches are relatives. Pouille’s arrangement with Mauresmo continues to be a story line, even though Mauresmo has coached men before, notably Britain’s Andy Murray, whom she guided to the Melbourne final in 2015.“Men are coaching women, so why not the contrary?” Pouille said at his news conference. “It’s not about being a man or a woman, it’s about knowing tennis, about having the good state of mind.”He summed up the ways that Mauresmo has helped him turn a corner. She creates “a cool atmosphere,” he explained. “We’re not too serious. We can laugh. We can make jokes. Once we go and hit the balls, we are really into it.”In other words, balance.And more: “I think she’s bringing a lot of confidence to my game.”Pouille will need every ounce of cool confidence, and likely the best tennis of his life, if he is to beat Djokovic on a packed center court stadium Friday.Will Pouille be overlooked once again?Not a chance, said Djokovic. “I always thought he’s a great player,” the Serb told the assembled reporters in the wake of his own quarterfinal win.Pouille “deserves to be definitely at the top 15, maybe top 10 of the world,” Djokovic added. “He’s got that quality and potential, no question about it. Here we go. It’s the semifinals. We both want to get to the finals. Hopefully we can both be fresh and fit and put on the great show.”"
"At the Miami Open, It’s Ashleigh Barty’s Turn for a Title - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion.April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season.“That’s amazing, isn’t it?” Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final.But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke.Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia’s 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup.Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women’s season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami.There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men’s doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas.The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday’s victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.“If you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,” Bob Bryan said.Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova.Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak.But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women’s tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980.Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors “we” and “team” more than “I” when discussing her rise.)Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday’s final.But it is Barty’s tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed.Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova’s six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova’s 66 percent.Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace.Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women’s tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm.“I have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,” Barty said. “It’s always about trying to neutralize what your opponent’s doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women’s tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women’s side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points.”She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova’s flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential.“I think I was an average cricketer, and I’m becoming a better tennis player,” she said. “It was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling.”So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige.Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well."
"Novak Djokovic Falls to Veteran German at Indian Wells - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Back on the march as the best player in men’s tennis, Novak Djokovic stumbled in the desert sunlight on Tuesday on his favorite surface.Djokovic flubbed some forehands and returns he normally makes in his third-round match at the BNP Paribas Open and cracked a racket in frustration. But he also ran into an inspired opponent in Philipp Kohlschreiber, a 35-year-old German who had lost seven straight matches to Djokovic but has long savored the memory of surprising Djokovic in the fourth round of the 2009 French Open.Now, nearly a decade later, Kohlschreiber has another upset tale to tell.No, Djokovic was not at his precise and predatory best, but Kohlschreiber still had to summon plenty of quality shot making and decision-making under pressure to finish him off, 6-4, 6-4.“Of course you always need the No. 1 not playing his best tennis to beat him, but I’m very happy with my performance,” Kohlschreiber said.It was a rough day all around for No. 1s. Naomi Osaka, the top player in the women’s game, was more soundly beaten. She lost, 6-3, 6-1, in the fourth round to Belinda Bencic in just 66 minutes. Osaka has won the last two Grand Slam singles titles, yet Tuesday’s result was no shock. Bencic, who just turned 22, is yet another great talent from Switzerland, land of Roger Federer and Martina Hingis. Bencic broke into the top 10 as a teenager in 2016 before left wrist surgery stopped her ascent.She broke Osaka’s powerful serve five times in this brief encounter and proved more steady from the baseline, as well. She is now on a 11-match winning streak after winning the title in Dubai and has five victories over top 10 players in the last month.“My injury just changed my perspective,” said Bencic, the No. 23 seed. “I learned so much from this time, and I’m really enjoying to be on the court.”Hardcourts remain Djokovic’s happiest hunting ground. Ten of his 15 Grand Slam singles titles have come on the surface that suits his elastic athleticism best.He also has won five singles titles at Indian Wells, but after winning three straight times here in 2015, 2016 and 2017, he has run into early-round trouble.Last year, in the midst of a deep funk and still recovering from elbow surgery, he made 58 unforced errors in an opening-match defeat to Taro Daniel, a Japanese qualifier. But this year, Djokovic arrived on an undeniable roll after sweeping to victory at the Australian Open, manhandling Rafael Nadal in the final.Djokovic has won three straight Grand Slam singles titles and will hold all four for the second time if he can prevail at the French Open in June and complete another so-called “Djoker Slam.”He is still in the doubles here after reaching the semifinals with partner Fabio Fognini later on Tuesday, but only the tournaments ahead will show if Djokovic’s singles performance was a blip or a harbinger of more struggles.“I had to get over it in an hour, because I played doubles,” Djokovic said. “I must admit I was thinking about it. When I hit a good return, I was wondering why this didn’t happen in singles. But it is, I guess, part of the world that we are, the world of tennis. It’s part of our world, and we just have to bounce back very quickly.”Djokovic said competing in the doubles gave him “a chance to rectify the wrongs,” but that his singles performance would not affect him in the long run.“I know what I’m capable of,” he said. “I know the quality of my tennis. It’s just one of those days. You just have to congratulate your opponent and move on.”The timing was intriguing, coming after a week replete with tennis politicking. Djokovic, as president of the ATP Player Council, spent the days before the tournament in meetings and debate, and the ATP’s board of directors ultimately voted last Thursday not to renew the contract of Chris Kermode, the tour’s chairman and chief executive.There has been plenty of pushback on the decision, with Nadal and Federer both pointing out that they were not consulted by Djokovic or council members in the run-up to the Kermode decision. Federer said he had reached out directly to Djokovic who had been unable to find time on his schedule for a discussion.But then neither Nadal nor Federer are on the council at this stage, although both have served in the past. Federer, a former president, has acknowledged that the role can be draining, particularly in fraught times, and Djokovic spoke about that challenge on Sunday after defeating American Bjorn Fratangelo in his opening match.“I care about the current generation and also the future generation and future of this sport,” Djokovic said. “I think that the sport is doing well, but it can also do better and better, you know, as we go along. And if I, with my status and with my position in the world of sport and tennis, can influence that positively, then why not? Yes, it takes away in energy and time, but I know I do it from the right place in my heart and with the right intent, and then I also receive a lot of energy for that.”He has received some criticism, too, but appears intent on trying to push for structural reforms on the ATP Tour, which could include dividing Kermode’s role into two separate positions, or changing the size or composition of the board.Success is far from guaranteed considering the internal tensions that exist in the ATP: an organization that is a long-running and often uneasy partnership between the players and those who own and operate the tournaments.It would be all too easy to get distracted.But some rejected any such speculation on Tuesday and emphasized Kohlschreiber’s performance. Among them: Nick Kyrgios, the unpredictable and intermittently committed Australian who won a hardcourt title in Mexico last week in style but was beaten, 6-4, 6-4, by Kohlschreiber in the second round here.“Something has to be wrong with him right?” Kyrgios tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Djokovic. “I lose to Kholi and get absolutely shredded ‘same old kyrgios’ how about the guy is just good? And he knows how to win matches? Hate this, why we always gotta kiss these guys when they lose?”Kohlschreiber was unseeded here but not by much with a world ranking of 39. Quick and powerful, he has one of the prettiest one-handed backhands in the game yet does his most consistent damage with his forehand.But in truth, he needed all his tennis tools to win on Tuesday after rain suspended play on Monday night after just one game. He also needed to put 71 percent of his first serves in play and save three of four break points against the game’s premier returner.“I think I was not unhappy with the rain delay,” he said. “I think the warmer conditions suited my game more today. I was fresh. I had two good wins. So everything came together.”Such moments have been hard to come by in the game’s biggest events during Kohlschreiber’s career, which has coincided with one of the greatest generations of stars in tennis history. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have 52 Grand Slam singles titles between them.Kohlschreiber said he appreciated their greatness but also appreciated the benefits of minor as opposed to major celebrity.“I’m still able to walk on the street or go to, I don’t know, McDonald’s and there is just a few guys saying, ‘Oh, that’s maybe Kohlschreiber,’” he said. “I don’t know if Roger or Rafa can do that.”"
"Will Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal Be Ready for the Clay-Court Season? - The New York Times
The main clay-court season is officially underway, and this time around it is particularly unclear how the dust might settle.If Rafael Nadal is truly healthy after aggravating a right knee injury three weeks ago — he has been training at home to prepare for the Monte Carlo Open — he remains the man to beat on the game’s grittiest surface. No one else has won 11 French Open singles titles, and the rational assumption is that no one else ever will.But the women’s game is in a wondrous state of flux, with 14 different champions in the season’s first 14 tournaments. And none of them was named Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova or Simona Halep.“It’s by far the most wide-open field as far as I can remember,” Chris Evert, the former No. 1 and a seven-time French Open champion, said in an interview Tuesday. “No one seems to have obvious momentum above the other. It’s not only the closeness in talent and skills. Attitudes, emotions and fitness and injuries enter into it as well. I have no clue.”Serena Williams has not won a title since returning to the tour in March 2018 after giving birth to her daughter. She has played only three tournaments this season and has not finished any of them feeling healthy. She twisted an ankle while on the brink of victory in an Australian Open quarterfinal against Karolina Pliskova and lost a 5-1 third-set lead, unable to convert on four match points.In Indian Wells, Calif., Williams retired in the third round against Garbiñe Muguruza, citing a viral illness. In Miami, she withdrew after winning her opening match, citing a left knee injury. Williams is 37, and her knees have long been a concern, restricting her training through the years. She does not plan to compete again until the Italian Open in Rome in mid-May, shortly before the French Open.That will leave her short of matches against an increasingly deep and confident field, which is full of young, exciting talents with all-court games who have grown up dealing with big pace. Williams’s quest for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, which once looked like only a matter of time, is now a more complicated matter.But discounting Williams is rarely a winning proposition. She has managed to play some sparkling tennis in 2019, striking the ball very cleanly in some of the early rounds in Australia and again in her victory over Victoria Azarenka in Indian Wells.“A healthy Serena is a dangerous Serena; she hasn’t been healthy all year,” Evert said. “She still has an edge in power and experience.”Williams also has the most impressive career record on clay of any active player: 170-34. Her career winning percentage of 83.3 puts her ahead of Sharapova, who is at 81.5 percent with plenty of doubt swirling about her form and her tennis future at age 31.Happy off the court but vulnerable on it, she has not competed since January because of injuries and has not reached a tour final since winning the Tianjin Open in October 2017.Halep has the best clay-court numbers over the last few seasons and leads the WTA Tour’s clay-court power rankings, which give more weight to recent results.But even as she again closes in on being No. 1, Halep, 27, has hardly been dominant. Oui, she won last year’s French Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. But she has not won another clay-court title since Madrid in May 2017 and has not won a tournament on any surface since the Rogers Cup in Canada in August.Without Darren Cahill as her coach this season, Halep has not looked like the same resolute and selectively aggressive force, although her run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last week was encouraging.The biggest prizes in 2019 have gone to younger women, all under age 23.Naomi Osaka, 21, won the year’s first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and remains No. 1 by a whisker. Belinda Bencic, 22, won the Premier 5 event in Dubai. Most surprisingly, Bianca Andreescu, 18, won the Premier Mandatory event in Indian Wells, and then Ashleigh Barty, 22, confirmed her steady rise by winning in Miami.Andreescu and Barty have the skills to thrive on clay — their strong topspin forehands, quick feet and ability to hit sliced backhands, well-disguised drop shots and heavy first and second serves.But the big-hitting Osaka has a losing record on clay (9-11) and likes to call herself “a hardcourt player.”She also has lost momentum since her surprising split with her coach, Sascha Bajin, after the Australian Open. She has hired Venus Williams’s former hitting partner, Jermaine Jenkins, a college star with a reassuring courtside demeanor. But for now, Osaka is only 3-3 since winning in Melbourne, with losses to Kristina Mladenovic in Dubai, to Bencic in Indian Wells and to the changeup artist Hsieh Su-wei in Miami.Novak Djokovic, the men’s No. 1, also has the wind in his face after losing early in Indian Wells and Miami. But he has won three Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and it is difficult to disregard the memory of Djokovic having his way from the baseline against Nadal in the Australian Open final.Nadal, 32, continues to battle his body. A recurrence of tendinitis in his right knee caused him to withdraw before his semifinal against Roger Federer in Indian Wells. At this stage, he knows too well the price of pushing through pain, although pain has been a constant. How much longer can he do it?“Who knows? Perhaps two or three years more,” Toni Nadal, his uncle and former coach, said at a recent appearance in Majorca. “What I say is that Rafael is not a person who plays tennis. He is an injured person who plays tennis, and that is very difficult.”Nadal is back training hard in Majorca on a surface that is more forgiving to his joints than hardcourts. He is on schedule to defend his title in Monte Carlo this month. Djokovic and No. 5 Dominic Thiem, Nadal’s two most obvious rivals for the biggest men’s clay-court titles, are expected to challenge him there. So is third-ranked Alexander Zverev, who has a fine clay-court record and the talent to win multiple majors but has been slumping.Federer, back on a roll at age 37 after winning in Miami and intent on returning to clay after a three-year break, plans to come back in Madrid in early May after training in Switzerland.“I still think Rafa is in a great place on clay,” said David Macpherson, the coach of John Isner, the top-ranked American, who may miss much of the clay-court season with a stress fracture in his foot. “The only one who has shown the ability to break up Rafa’s game at times is Novak, with his ability to smother that topspin forehand early with his pure two-handed backhand and negate Rafa’s strengths on clay. So that’s always a fascinating matchup.”But based on all the plot twists and ankle twists in 2019 so far, there are no guarantees that it will be the decisive matchup.Time to watch the dust try to settle."
"At 40, Ivo Karlovic Remains a Towering and Punishing Force - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — It was 2011. Ivo Karlovic was already an ATP Tour veteran with graying temples, and his close friend and former coach Tarik Benhabiles was talking about Karlovic’s serve, and his future.“He has a huge weapon,” Benhabiles told me. “He can play until he’s 40 years old, no problem.”Kudos to Benhabiles, who once helped Andy Roddick become a force, for knowing his tennis. But, above all, kudos to Karlovic, the 6-foot-11 Croatian, for finding a way to fight and serve through everything life has thrown at him.It has hardly been “no problem,” but Karlovic turned 40 on Feb. 28, and he is definitely still playing.He has won three rounds at the BNP Paribas Open this year and is now the oldest man to win a singles match at a Masters 1000 event. On Wednesday, with plenty of gray in his beard now as well as in his temples, Karlovic will deploy his fearsome weapon against Dominic Thiem, the No. 7 seed, for a place in the quarterfinals.At 25, Thiem is 15 years younger than Karlovic — but then just about everybody on tour is younger than Karlovic, including some of his former rivals who are now coaches.“He’s older than me!” said Ivan Ljubicic, the 39-year-old co-coach of Roger Federer, who remains the most prominent graybeard in men’s tennis but is still Karlovic’s junior at 37.Karlovic has remained a factor by overcoming a major Achilles’ tendon injury in 2010 and encephalitis in 2013, which caused debilitating headaches and left him temporarily without feeling in his right arm.He has remained a force by focusing on fitness and dropping weight to take the pressure off his knees and other joints. He is down to 225 pounds, from 245 in 2011.On court, Karlovic has learned to maximize his strengths and accept his weaknesses. He will never have a drive backhand, but his one-handed slice is crisp enough. And though his lateral mobility remains limited compared to his competitors, his forehand is huge and his serve-and-volley style is even more unusual and disorienting in this baseline-focused era.In truth, his style is often serve-and-no-volley. He has slammed an ATP record 13,235 aces. Along the way, he has definitively proven, like it or not, that there is a place in a movement-based game for players of towering height like the 6-10 John Isner, the 33-year-old American star, and the 6-11 Reilly Opelka, a 21-year-old from the U.S. who is hitting aces at a rapid clip of his own.“If you look at any sport, everywhere there are taller guys, so I know that is the future in tennis,” Karlovic said, as he has said for years.Ljubicic, who had a huge serve of his own and will turn 40 this month, grew up playing junior tournaments with Karlovic in Croatia and elsewhere. It was a time of war in the former Yugoslavia, and tennis was often the least of the youngsters’ concerns.Fearing for their lives, Ljubicic’s family fled Bosnia and ended up briefly in a refugee camp in Croatia. Ljubicic eventually ended up honing his game in an Italian tennis club and reaching No. 3 in the world in 2006 before retiring in 2012.Karlovic stayed in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. He was the son of well-educated professionals: his father a meteorologist; his mother an agronomist.“In Zagreb, there were not a lot of airstrikes, but I spent a lot of time in the bomb shelters,” Karlovic said of his early teens. “It was always airstrike warnings.”Funds were short, and so was quality coaching and court time. Karlovic had already decided he preferred tennis to basketball despite attempts to recruit him. He would wait until the evening when the tennis courts in Zagreb were empty and then use the balls he could find and hit serves on his own, sometimes after dark.“It was the only way I could practice,” he said. “I would like people to know that my serve is not only that good because of my height. I worked on it a lot.”He did not find a regular coach until his early 20s, and despite his imposing presence he managed to fly far below the radar until the first round of Wimbledon in 2003, where, as an all-but-unknown qualifier in an age before social media, he upset the defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in four sets on Centre Court.“It was not easy: I was looking around at all these huge courts I never had a chance to play on before,” Karlovic said. “I lost the first set 6-1, but after that I just kind of calmed down and started playing my game, and then after the match, it was not easy because everybody wanted to know, who am I?”What made it harder was the pronounced stammer that Karlovic has had since boyhood, which made public speaking excruciating.“I was just thinking to myself, this is what you have to do if you want to become a good player,” he said of post-match news conferences. “You’re going to have to do it.”Nearly 16 years later, the stammer is much less pronounced, and Karlovic has become not only an excellent player but an enduring one. He peaked in the rankings at No. 14 in 2008 but was still in the top 20 last year before injuries contributed to him dropping to No. 138 in September.Instead of calling it a career, Karlovic chose to head back to tennis’s minor leagues with the goal of making the main draw of the Australian Open. If he didn’t achieve that goal, he would retire. He played in a series of ATP Challenger events in the final months of 2018, winning one in Calgary.Australia beckoned. But Karlovic, now based in Plantation, Fla., said one of the biggest challenges has been leaving his family behind. He and his wife, Alsi, have two children: a 7-year-old daughter, Jada, and an 18-month-old son, Noah.“I had to leave on Christmas Day to get to a tournament in India,” he said. “So everybody was home. We had friends over, family, and then after lunch I was on the way to the airport. It was really difficult. My kids were crying and stuff, so it wasn’t easy, but on the other hand, I am doing this also because of them, you know? So they don’t have it as hard as I had it. So maybe that evens out the pain for me.”He wanted Jada to have a memory of him as a professional tennis player.“But now I also have a little one who is one-and-a-half years old,” said Karlovic, now ranked No. 89. “So I guess for him to remember me I’m going to have to play at least another eight more years.”Presumably not even Benhabiles is ready to predict that."
"At the Miami Open, Latin American Players Feel at Home - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — This year’s Miami Open is about 20 miles north of its previous home on Key Biscayne, but the tournament’s cultural epicenter is unmoved. It’s still somewhere thousands of miles to the south.Because there is no tournament of its caliber in Mexico, the Caribbean, or Central and South America, the Miami Open has developed into the de facto Latin American Slam, drawing fans from the region and its diasporas, transforming this Florida fixture into a virtual homecoming for Latino players.“It’s really nice to have the support,” said Leonardo Mayer, an Argentine. “It’s almost like playing in Buenos Aires.”The top South American player, Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, missed this year’s tournament because of a knee injury, but fans had to change only one letter in their customary cheer for him in order to root for his compatriot Federico Delbonis, who took a set off top-ranked Novak Djokovic on Sunday. Instead of “Olé, olé, olé, olé! Delpo, Delpo!” they chanted, “Delbo, Delbo!”Even away from the court, the Miami area’s large Latino population affects the experience of playing in the tournament. Delbonis said he appreciated being able to buy yerba mate leaves in Miami to make his favorite beverage; for most events, he has to travel with his own supply.“Every time I come here I feel like I want to be here, I want to live here,” he said. “When I got to the court today, I heard a lot of Argentinians speaking Spanish, cheering in Spanish, and you feel that energy they give you. They give you confidence, and you feel it inside. It’s good for your game to be more happy on court.”Monica Puig, who in 2016 won Puerto Rico’s first Olympic gold medal, had vocal support from many Puerto Rican fans in her first-round match on Wednesday, when she lost to Wang Xiyu. She said regretted not being able to play more matches throughout the season in front of that crowd, which included her father.“Having that Latin American feel here, just buzzing all over the place, it’s really special,” said Puig, the only Latin American woman ranked in the top 100 in singles.Even fans from Latin American countries that are not represented among the players make their presence felt. After Fabio Fognini of Italy defeated Guido Andreozzi of Argentina on Friday, a woman unfurled a large Paraguayan flag.Latin American reporters travel to the Miami Open in droves, with 24 representatives of Argentine news media leading this year’s international contingent, according to the tournament.Though Latin American fans initially embraced the tournament organically, the event has begun marketing to them directly, including digital advertising in South America in both Spanish and Portuguese, as well as on Spanish-language websites in South Florida. (While Latin food and music can be found on the grounds, all the signs at the Miami Open are in English.)Players from the United States have to adjust to this rare home tournament where the crowds may not tip in their favor. Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay recalled being stunned in 2011 when fans chanted his country’s name as he upset Andy Roddick, the defending champion and American star, on the stadium court of Key Biscayne.In one of the last matches played at the old venue in 2018, the American John Isner, the eventual champion, had little support when he met del Potro in the semifinals.“The fans were great, but it was not 50-50,” Isner said, smiling. “There were a lot of Argentinian flags, that country loves their sport, loves their soccer and their tennis. To see all the flags in the crowd, it was a very, very cool atmosphere.”Many other non-Latin American players similarly relish the passionate crowds.“I’ve always played the best in countries and in places where I felt that energy,” Alexander Zverev of Germany said. “In Rome I always felt great. Italians are very energetic, powerful people. Madrid, Mexico, Miami: It’s always those kind of places I’ve played well in. For me, I enjoy when the crowd is loud, energetic, and it’s nice when this happens.”Dominic Thiem of Austria has won four of his 12 career titles in Latin America — two in Argentina and one each in Mexico and Brazil.“The energy in these countries and from these people is nice,” Thiem said. “It feels like they are always in a good mood. They are happy to live, I feel. It’s sometimes different in Europe — maybe it’s the weather, I don’t know.”James Blake, a former player from the United States who is now the tournament director of the Miami Open, said he had savored his two matches against Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil at the tournament, where American supporters could not match the Brazilians’ boisterousness.“Those are a lot of fun, because you’re on the edge of your seat,” Blake said. “Every big point, every shot, is exacerbated by the fact that the crowd’s going crazy, and you’re angry at yourself because their crowd is going crazy.”Players are not always comfortable with the din.“There are some players who don’t love it,” Blake said, “and they’ve voiced that to me, plenty.”After she lost to Puig last year, Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark threatened to boycott the tournament, saying her supporters felt threatened by people in the profusely pro-Puig crowd.Wozniacki did return this year and said she had not discussed the incident with tournament organizers since. Last week she focused on the positives of the partisanship — like hearing the chants for Delbonis as she played on a nearby court, and being able to quell the noise.“I could hear it was like a soccer-like atmosphere,” Wozniacki said. “It’s cool. It’s obviously more fun when they cheer for you. At the same time it’s also fun to quiet the fans. It’s fun when all of a sudden it goes dead quiet.”Jérémy Chardy enjoyed silencing the cacophony of Chileans who were raucously supporting his opponent, Nicolàs Jarry, in their first-round match. After he won, he blew kisses toward the Chilean contingent.“You always know when you play a South American here it will be difficult,” Chardy said. “The crowd was difficult all the match, and I didn’t say a word. Just at the end when I won, I wanted to send them kisses, and they replied with some fingers.”Chardy said he appreciated the animated crowd, despite the animus.“Even if it was not always respectful,” he said, “I prefer when there’s atmosphere to no atmosphere.”"
"Roger Federer Is the Defending Australian Open Champion, but Not the Favorite - The New York Times
PERTH, Australia — Amélie Mauresmo won her two Grand Slam singles titles in 2006 and retired three years later. She had no idea that Roger Federer, the man who won Grand Slam singles titles on those same weekends as her in 2006, would still be on top of his sport more than a decade later.“I don’t know how he does it,” Mauresmo said. “What it puts on your body is huge. The training, the matches, the travel, the jet lag, anything.”Mauresmo and Federer won the Australian Open and Wimbledon singles titles in 2006. Two years older than Federer, Mauresmo, 39, retired from the sport in 2009, at 30, and is at the Australian Open as coach of the French player Lucas Pouille.Federer is at the Australian Open as the two-time defending champion. His bid for a 21st Grand Slam singles championship begins Monday in Melbourne.“Winning back-to-back Australian Opens like this, in my mid-30s, it’s one of my favorite things I will look back on in my career,” he said. “I didn’t think it was going to happen, and I had such a great time here in Australia the last couple of years and always enjoyed playing here.”Federer acknowledges his age readily, quipping at the Hopman Cup recently that his 20-year-old opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, “could be my son.” And he marvels at his own ability to run up the score in the record books — 99 titles and counting — at an age when many would count him out.But after an auspicious start to last season, when he won his first 17 matches, Federer seemed to trail off. After winning the title in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in February and briefly reclaiming the No. 1 ranking, Federer went without another tournament championship until October. After skipping the clay-court season for the second year in a row, he lost in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon after holding a match point against Kevin Anderson, and in the fourth round of the United States Open to John Millman.Federer played down the doomsday talk that accompanied his stagnation in the second half of the year.“I wasn’t too disappointed,” he said. “I was more surprised to hear that there was sort of concern, or people were saying, ‘What a bad second half to the year.’ ”Federer conceded disappointing finishes at the Grand Slam events but thought he otherwise played well, including a loss in a third-set tiebreaker to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals of the Paris Masters in November.He said what he needed to do better this year “is really play well when it really comes down to the crunch.”Federer said he trusted his own evaluations of his play as well as input from his coaches, Ivan Ljubicic and Severin Lüthi.“I can analyze — with my age, very well — my own matches and my own feelings,” he said. “I have two great coaches, two of the best in the game, who give me their fair assessment, and I have a fitness coach who tells me if I’m moving good or not. They’re all open and honest towards me. I don’t want any sugarcoating; I want it real, and straight. That’s it. I know, always, where I’m at.“It’s very clear in my team where I stand. And from that standpoint, I’m happy where I am right now. I’m in a great position.”Mauresmo longs to learn more about what Federer does in his off-seasons.“I hope one day he will explain to everyone everything,” she said. “The little details, everything that he’s put together to be able to play this well at his age, to move this well.”Federer is not exactly clandestine about his routines. He prefers, for example, to do his off-season movement drills on a tennis court, rather than indoors as many players do, to better simulate the footing and friction of match conditions.“I do a bit of weights, too,” he said, grinning and gesturing toward his lithe frame. “I know we don’t see it, but I do.”Federer started his season auspiciously, winning all eight sets he played at the Hopman Cup last week, never dropping serve in any of the matches.But he considers the top-ranked Djokovic the clear favorite at the Australian Open. Djokovic, a six-time champion in Melbourne, has won the last two Grand Slam tournaments.“We know who the usual are,” said Federer, who is seeded third, “and I’m part of that bunch.”The longevity of that oligarchy, which also includes Rafael Nadal, has blocked several younger players from breaking through on tennis’s biggest stages. No player currently younger than 30 has won even a set in a Grand Slam final.“We’re all tired of you guys already, but what can we do?” fourth-ranked Alexander Zverev, 21, said during the trophy ceremony of the Hopman Cup on Saturday, when he lost to Federer in singles and mixed doubles.“Especially you,” he added, turning around and looking at Federer, who laughed. “I mean, you’re 30-whatever! Why? Just, why? Let us have one.”"
"During the Lunar Eclipse, Something Slammed Into the Moon - The New York Times
On Sunday and Monday, those in the Western Hemisphere with clear skies were fortunate enough to see the last total lunar eclipse of the decade. As the moon took on a distinctly redder shade just before midnight Eastern Time, livestreams of the phenomenon showed a flash of light suddenly and briefly emanating from the lunar surface.Anthony Cook, an astronomical observer at Los Angeles’ Griffith Observatory which streamed the eclipse, thought it could have just been the camera’s random electronic noise. Then astronomers and citizen scientists started to share their detection of the flash on Reddit and Twitter.The only explanation was that something slammed into the lunar surface and obliterated itself.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]The moon is a multi-billion-year-old library of impact events, with fresh collisions still taking place frequently today. Capturing a lunar impact on video is rare enough, but this event — a collision during a total lunar eclipse — may be a first.“I have not heard of anyone seeing an impact like this during a lunar eclipse before,” said Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum in London.Dr. Russell said that flashes can only be seen from Earth when the lunar surface is in shadow, which is normally just a few days before and after the new moon. A luminous full moon is anathema to such detections, but a total lunar eclipse, painting our pale celestial companion in darkness, changed that.Justin Cowart, a graduate student in geosciences at Stony Brook University in New York who spotted the flash, managed to narrow down the impact location. Using images from an amateur astronomer, Christian Fröschlin, Mr. Cowart determined that the flash took place somewhere in the lunar highlands, south of Byrgius crater.NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which studies the moon’s surface, may soon spot the fresh crater. But the impact flash itself can be used to roughly estimate the size of the object that crashed on the moon, and its momentum. Based on NASA and European Space Agency databases of impact flashes, Mr. Cowart guesses that “it was probably somewhere between the size of an acorn and tennis ball.”Detection data from the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System, or MIDAS, found that the space rock was a pipsqueak of a meteoroid, only weighing something like 22 pounds, and measuring no more than 12 inches across.The provenance of the meteoroid remains an open question. According to Jose Maria Madiedo, an astrophysicist at the University of Huelva in Spain who is a co-director of the MIDAS system, most objects that hit Earth come from comets and not asteroids, and the same applies to the moonWith that in mind, he said, “the most likely situation is that the impactor was a rock from a comet.” Considering its tiny dimensions, it must have been moving at an incredible speed to create a flash of light visible from Earth. Indeed, Dr. Madiedo said that the impact velocity would be in the range of 38,000 miles per hour. That is just over twice the speed that NASA’s old space shuttle had to move after launch to achieve orbit of Earth.A total lunar eclipse is always something to marvel at, but one being gate-crashed by a hypersonic cometary shard is something else entirely."
"Andy Murray Gave His All. Which Is Why This Ending Hurts. - The New York Times
Andy Murray is not the youngest of the tennis supergroup known as the Big Four. Novak Djokovic was born a week later than Murray was.But it is still quite an unpleasant surprise to realize that Murray, 31, very likely will be the first of the remarkable quartet to retire.Roger Federer is somehow still gliding at 37. Rafael Nadal is somehow still persevering at 32.But Murray has been in too much pain for too long with no relief in view, and on Friday in Melbourne, Australia, all of those who have followed his career from up close or a great distance could share some of his pain, too.It was not what he said. It was what he couldn’t say.Murray, like all tennis stars of his stature, has spent as much time in news conferences as most of us have spent at the coffee shop. They are an artificial construct that has become a natural habitat for Murray, a droll, strong-minded Scotsman with the voice that sounds like a low-flying drone — a voice he once called “my least favorite thing about me.”But as he sat down behind the table on Friday, his cap pulled low and his lips pursed, reporters placed digital recorders on the table in front him to capture the words. There was soon nothing to capture.Asked how he and his ailing hip were feeling, he answered, “Yeah, not, not great.”He then sighed, averted his glance, dropped his chin, touched the bill of his cap and his face, fought for composure and was unable to utter another word for nearly a minute before finally grabbing his credential off the desk and leaving the room.Though he soon returned, nothing he explained then was nearly as eloquent as those 45 seconds of silence.What mattered most was all in there: the sensitivity, the humanity, the competitive fire reduced to anguish at not being able to solve his hip problem despite all the medical expertise, financial resources and iron will at his disposal.Murray plans to play on, hopefully until Wimbledon this summer, although there are no guarantees. He acknowledged that this Australian Open, which begins Monday, could be the finish line, and surely the poignancy of making such an announcement in Melbourne was not lost on him.[Update: Andy Murray loses in his first-round match at the Australian Open.]Sir Andrew Barron Murray has had many triumphs in his 31 years: back-to-back Olympic gold medals and three Grand Slam titles, none more resonant than his winning Wimbledon in 2013 to end a 77-year drought for British men in singles. Many other worthies, including Bunny Austin and Tim Henman, had embarked on the same quest and faltered.But Australia is where Murray has had to face his own tennis limitations.He broke down in tears during the awards ceremony after losing the final to Federer in 2010, but though he has, in his own words, “kept it together” since then in Melbourne, 2010 was only the beginning of the disappointment. He lost the final again in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016.No other man has gone 0-5 in singles finals at the same major tournament, and he shares the blame with Djokovic, his one-time doubles partner, who has beaten Murray in the last four of those finals.So close in age and skill sets, they first played as 13-year-olds at Les Petits As junior tournament in France. Murray won in a hurry, but they have played 36 times as professionals, more than enough to make it clear that Djokovic is the greater player.He leads their series by 25-11 and has 14 Grand Slam singles titles (and counting). For many, the Big Four has become the Big Three. And doesn’t Stan Wawrinka have — like Murray — three major titles of his own?Such arguments have merit: Federer and Nadal also have winning records against Murray, and there is no doubt now that in the final analysis of this golden tennis era, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic will be the central figures and the statistical leaders.But Murray earned his place in tennis’s great modern foursome, with his week-to-week consistency, his resilience, his all-surface brilliance and his ability to excel at Wimbledon with the equivalent of the Centre Court roof on his shoulders.“Never motivated by money, only by his rivals; he didn’t need people’s respect, but he earned it,” Mark Petchey, Murray’s former coach, said in the wake of Murray’s announcement.Murray might not have been here at all. He and his older brother, Jamie, were young students at Dunblane Primary School in their Scottish town in 1996 when a local resident entered the grounds and murdered 16 of their schoolmates and a teacher before shooting himself.The Murray brothers survived, though not without invisible scars, and they both grew up to become No. 1 in the world: Andy in singles, Jamie in doubles.That is a tribute to their childhood sibling rivalry, their talent and their work ethic, and also to their formidable tennis mother, Judy, a former Scottish professional player who has been a driving force with her intuition, her ambition, her sharp wit and her informed passion for the game.Jamie, 32 and still in the top 10 in doubles, plans to play beyond 2019. Andy, at this stage, does not.“He was a kaleidoscope of talent, of emotion, of movement, spirit and authenticity,” said Petchey, a former British player who introduced Murray to Kim Sears, who would become Murray’s wife. “He was a winner, but he became a champion. A champion not just on the court but a champion of causes off it. He leaves as he arrived. Tennis never changed him, but he changed tennis.”Murray, in part (but only in part) because of his mother’s impact on his career, has been the rare men’s No. 1 to speak out frequently in support of gender equality and women’s tennis, whose results he actually seems to follow. He has also walked the walk, hiring a woman as a coach: Amélie Mauresmo.That has endeared him to a wider audience and only underscored the gulf between on-court Murray and off-court Murray. Under pressure and between the lines, he has often been far from endearing: barking at his entourage, using language better suited to the Glasgow docks, and muttering, muttering, muttering as he chased perfection in a sport that refused to cooperate.Watching him at work, it all has often seemed more a burden than a pleasure. His service motion resembles heavy lifting, and long before his hip problems became career threatening, his walk between points looked closer to a hobble.But that was before he sensed an opportunity and sprang into action: a short ball he could pounce on for a winner, a wide ball he could chase down that hardly anyone else in the game could have reached.Murray in his prime was above all a supreme athlete, possessed of quickness, coordination, feathery touch and selective striking power.As recently as 2016, he had his finest season, winning nine titles and reaching No. 1 for the first time. It still seems premature to believe that he is just about done. After all, retirement in tennis has long been a euphemism for a sabbatical, and one of Murray’s peers who has dealt with pain offered words of encouragement on Friday.“Please don’t stop trying,” Juan Martín del Potro wrote on Twitter. “Keep fighting. I can imagine your pain and sadness. I hope you can overcome this. You deserve to retire on your own terms, whenever that happens.”Del Potro speaks from experience; multiple wrist operations nearly snuffed out his career. His is a voice to be heeded. But unfortunately so is Murray’s, especially when the emotions are so powerful that the words just won’t come."
"Belinda Bencic Is Bouncing Back, Forcefully - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Belinda Bencic is making a tricky game look easy at the moment, redirecting her big-swinging opponents’ best shots into the corners, conjuring defensive lobs and flicking reflex returns from inside the baseline.“I’m trying not to think who is on the other side of the court,” she said.But there is no ignoring the quality of her recent tennis victims. From Dubai to Indian Wells, Bencic has been taking on the best in the women’s game and emerging again and again with a broad smile on her face.On Thursday, she ran her winning streak to 12 matches by defeating her sixth top-10 opponent in less than a month. On Tuesday she had routed Naomi Osaka, the new world No. 1, in little more than an hour at the BNP Paribas Open, but in Thursday’s quarterfinal, Bencic met with a great deal more resistance from No. 5 seed Karolina Pliskova before prevailing, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, in 2 hours 16 minutes.It was a match of fluctuating quality but no shortage of bravura shotmaking in the breeze, Pliskova’s flat power against Bencic’s fast-twitch counterpunching.“I think Belinda’s the best in the world at redirecting power, I really do,” said Mary Joe Fernandez, the ESPN analyst and a former champion at Indian Wells.That is quite a statement, considering that women’s tennis is full of talented counterpunchers, including the reigning French Open champion, Simona Halep, and the reigning Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, who will face Bencic in the semifinals after defeating Venus Williams, 7-6 (3), 6-3, on Thursday.But Bencic, a Swiss extrovert who turned 22 on Sunday and is returning to the fore after injury, has long been considered one of the game’s most sparkling talents. She was taught to see the game in full by her father, Ivan, and also by Melanie Molitor, the mother and coach of Martina Hingis, the Swiss wunderkind who rose to No. 1 by treating a tennis court like a chessboard.Switzerland’s tennis star-in-chief, Roger Federer, has played a supportive role in Bencic’s career of late, partnering with her in the Hopman Cup team event and sending encouraging messages.“She’s worked a lot for this moment, and the big reward is coming now,” Federer said. “I got to know her at the Hopman Cup and tried to give her as much advice as I could. She’s got a different game and is in a different stage of her career. Hopefully I helped. But the credit is hers and her team’s.”When Ivan Bencic first became interested in having his daughter play the game, Federer had not yet broken through to the elite level. Hingis was the Swiss player he watched and admired, and their families had more in common than an attraction to tennis. Molitor and Hingis had immigrated to Switzerland from the Slovakian side of the former Czechoslovakia. So had Ivan Bencic, whose family fled the country in 1968 after the Soviet invasion.Ivan Bencic telephoned Molitor when Belinda was 5 years old and asked her to take a look at his daughter’s nascent game. Molitor was impressed enough to offer to help from time to time. It became a much more profound connection after Molitor started her own academy, and Hingis later added her own counsel to the mix.Though Bencic has more natural power and a more potent serve than her mentor did in her prime, she shares the ability to read tennis tea leaves even in the midst of a fast-paced rally.“She was helping me a lot,” Bencic said of Hingis, who retired in October 2017 as the world’s No. 1 doubles player.At that stage, Bencic was still coming back from an operation on her left wrist. Though she is right handed, the pain had kept her from hitting her two-handed backhand effectively.She had appeared to be on a fast train to the top after defeating Caroline Wozniacki, Ana Ivanovic, Serena Williams and Halep in 2015 at age 18, on her way to the Rogers Cup title in Toronto and to later reaching the top 10.But her wrist injury changed that career arc, causing her to miss five months in 2017 and fall outside the top 300. She returned at low-level professional tournaments in Europe rather than use a protected ranking and return at the highest level.Less than two years later, that looks like the right move. There have been some stumbles, but she has found her footing and is guaranteed to re-enter the top 20 on Monday.“I played those small events and built my confidence back up with my ranking,” she said of 2017. “Because with the wrist, you never know if it’s going to be good or going to hold. You hear so many stories of someone needing a second wrist surgery and then another one, and it wasn’t great. So definitely the first tournaments, it’s always a test to see if you can keep up. I didn’t want to play a big tournament with all the people right away and have the comeback in the public eye. I definitely needed matches and confidence.”She is getting both in large quantities now. She beat four top-10 players on her way to the title in Dubai last month: Aryna Sabalenka, Halep, Elina Svitolina and Petra Kvitova. She has now beaten Osaka and Pliskova in Indian Wells and, based on level of play, can be considered the favorite for the title.This is a fascinating, power-shifting phase in women’s tennis. Osaka, 21, has been the player of the moment for the last six months, winning the singles titles at the 2018 United States Open and this year’s Australian Open.But fresh threats to the new and fragile order continue to surface. Bianca Andreescu, an 18-year-old Canadian wild card, has reached the semifinals here and has a 25-3 record in tour-level matches this year.Bencic is not emerging, of course. She is re-emerging, and though it could not have been easy to see players near her age — such as Osaka and Jelena Ostapenko, the surprise 2017 French Open champion — claim the biggest trophies, Bencic said that envy was not a driving force.“It’s great that we have so many great players in our age group,” she said. “But it’s not like I’m thinking, ‘Ah, I’m much better than her, and she’s winning Grand Slams, and I’m not.’ I definitely don’t have this mind-set, because I feel like that person who wins a Grand Slam definitely deserves it. They must be doing something right. It’s only inspiring for me.”To get her game right this year, Bencic decided to have her father return as her full-time coach for the first time since 2016.“It’s definitely not a coincidence I’m playing the way I’m playing now,” she said.She wanted her freedom in 2016, but believes that they are both on the same wavelength now. And when she was getting edgy against Halep in Dubai, she called her father onto the court for a coaching visit, and he told her to take a moment, look around and appreciate how far she had come.Her fitness has also improved significantly, something she attributes to maturity and to her Slovakian fitness coach, Martin Hromkovic, a former soccer player who is also her boyfriend.“For me, it works right now very well,” she said. “When we are doing the work, Martin is my coach, and I’m respecting that. But as well I am feeling the support so much, like he’s doing everything he can for me and sacrificing really a lot. So I’m super happy to have him by my side.”"
"Hopman Cup Out, ATP Cup In for Overhaul of Australia Swing - The New York Times
PERTH, Australia — The Hopman Cup international mixed team event is making way for the new ATP Cup at the start of the 2020 tennis season in Australia.The International Tennis Federation on Thursday confirmed an early end to the licensing agreement with Tennis Australia for the Hopman Cup, which had been scheduled to continue in Perth until 2022.The ITF issued a statement saying it still supported a combined men's and women's event after three decades of success, and was searching for a new venue.""The ITF is committed to upholding the core values of the Hopman Cup in the future and is encouraged by the interest that has already been expressed,"" ITF president David Haggerty said. ""We will keep the Hopman Cup alive and look forward to successful future editions of this unique event.""Roger Federer and Belinda Bencic combined to win the last two Hopman Cup titles for Switzerland. Serena Williams and Steffi Graf have also been among the winners of the tournament which started in 1989.The international season usually gets into full swing in Australia in the weeks leading into the first major of the year at Melbourne Park in January.But the introduction of the ATP Cup has meant an overhaul in Australia for next year, with Perth joining Brisbane as a co-host of the group stage of the men's team tournament and Sydney hosting the finals.""The ATP Cup will launch the global tennis season for the men — this is their event ... and they've thrown their support behind it 100 percent,"" Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley said. ""Four of the top 12 male players, and eight of the top 24, will play in Perth, with 24 teams competing across three cities — Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.""The ATP Cup has 750 rankings points, $22 million in prize money. It will feature two singles and a doubles match in each head-to-head between countries, and will run alongside the Brisbane International, which remains a season-opening event on the women's tour.___"
"Australian Barty Beats Pliskova for Miami Open Title - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Amid the unpredictable swirl of this year's tennis results, with 33 different champions in 33 tournaments, Ashleigh Barty provides a change of pace.The crafty 5-foot-5 Australian mixes backhand slices and drop shots with a deceptively strong serve and a knack for attacking, which is how she won the Miami Open.Barty had a career-high 15 aces and became the newest 2019 titlist on the ATP and WTA circuits by beating Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (1), 6-3 Saturday.That means there still has not been a repeat champion this year among the men or women.""Amazing, isn't it?"" Barty said. ""On the women's side, I think the level has evened out a lot, and the depth has grown over the last few years. Everyone in the draw has a legitimate chance of winning the tournament, and you try to make the most of it.""In Miami, Barty did. The former professional cricket player won her fourth tennis title and the biggest of her career to improve to 18-3 this year. At age 22, she'll rise next week to a career-high ranking of No. 9.Barty became the fifth different Miami Open women's champion in the past five years, and she's the 14th different WTA titlist in 2019.Roger Federer could become tennis' first repeat champion this year when he plays John Isner in the men's final Sunday. Federer won Dubai early this month.Barty's large repertoire of shots is both entertaining and effective, and she kept a weary Pliskova off balance while finding the open court for 41 winners.""I've always tried to bring as much variety to the court as possible,"" Barty said. ""It's about trying to neutralize what your opponent is doing. There was a phase in women's tennis of big power and first strikers, but physicality in tennis has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize the big first ball and work their way into the point.""Barty can strike quickly, too. Her surprising serve was superior in the final even though Pliskova is 8 inches taller at 6-foot-1.The Aussie won a 14-stroke rally with a nifty backhand drop shot to go up 2-1 in the tiebreaker, and she was ahead the rest of the way. She outlasted Pliskova in a 20-point game to break at the start of the second set, smacked three consecutive aces for a 3-1 lead, and won eight of the final nine points.Pliskova, seeded fifth, blamed her fade on fatigue. Because of rain delays, her semifinal win over No. 2-seeded Simona Halep lasted until early Friday morning, and she looked flat-footed in the final.""Run, run,"" Pliskova's coach, Conchita Martinez, implored during a changeover.""I was tired, super tired,"" Pliskova said. ""If I felt a little bit more fresh, it could maybe be different.""Barty made sure Pliskova never got her second wind, striking from all over the court. Among the Aussie's most acrobatic shots was a leaping overhead winner struck while backpedaling in pursuit of a lob. The crowd loved it, and so did she.""It's pretty cool to have played such a good match today in a big situation,"" she said.Barty won the Wimbledon girls' title in 2011 at age 15, but gave up tennis to play professional cricket in Brisbane before returning to the tour in 2016.This year she lost in the final at Sydney, a moment she listed as the most painful in her career. Less than three weeks later she reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the Australian Open.""That's why I love the sport,"" Barty said. ""You have these amazing moments, and you have these heartbreaking moments. But the journey in the middle is pretty bloody good.""______"

"Ad Showing Naomi Osaka With Light Skin Prompts Backlash and an Apology - The New York Times
Naomi Osaka, the half-Haitian, half-Japanese tennis champion, is the star of a new Japanese anime-style advertisement.The problem? The cartoon Ms. Osaka bears little resemblance to her real, biracial self.Her skin was unmistakably lightened, and her hair style changed — a depiction that has prompted criticism in Japan, where she has challenged a longstanding sense of cultural and racial homogeneity.The ad — unveiled this month by Nissin, one of the world’s largest instant-noodle brands — features Ms. Osaka and Kei Nishikori, Japan’s top-ranked male tennis player, in a cartoon drawn by a team commissioned by Nissin. The cartoon was based on the work of Takeshi Konomi, a well-known manga artist whose series “The Prince of Tennis” is popular in Japan.Ms. Osaka, who faces Elina Svitolina in an Australian Open quarterfinal match on Wednesday, and Mr. Konomi have not publicly commented on the reactions to the ad.But a Nissin spokesman apologized in an email on Tuesday for “the confusion and discomfort.”The spokesman, Daisuke Okabayashi, said that the characters had been developed in line with Mr. Konomi’s anime series and that the company had communicated with Ms. Osaka’s representatives.“There is no intention of whitewashing,” he said. “We accept that we are not sensitive enough and will pay more attention to diversity issue in the future.”After the ad was first published online, people on social media, including many fans of Ms. Osaka’s, said they were deeply disappointed.Baye McNeil, an author who has lived in Japan for 15 years, said he didn’t understand why the ad would “erase her black features and project this image of pretty much the prototypical anime girl-next-door character.”Ms. Osaka’s rise into a beloved national figure has been particularly exciting for biracial people in Japan, known as hafus, who have long battled for acceptance, he said.“Making her look white just tells these people that what they are isn’t good enough,” Mr. McNeil said.Ms. Osaka was born in Japan to a Haitian-American father and a Japanese mother, and moved to the United States when she was 3. Although she isn’t fluent in Japanese, often responding to questions from Japanese reporters in English, she has tweeted about her love of manga and Japanese movies.Ranked fourth in the world at just 21, she’s already among Japan’s most accomplished tennis players ever. She became the first Japanese-born tennis player to win a Grand Slam singles championship in September when she defeated Serena Williams in the U.S. Open, a victory that supercharged her celebrity ascent.That win prompted a cartoon in an Australian newspaper that was criticized for its depiction of Ms. Williams, which many saw as a racist caricature. While most of the condemnation focused on how the Australian cartoonist drew Ms. Williams, critics also noted that Ms. Osaka was depicted with blond hair and light skin.Black characters aren’t frequently found in anime, but artists in the medium have successfully depicted their skin tones before.“When there is a black character, it’s clearly a black character,” Mr. McNeil said.The discussion of biracial identity in Japan got a boost in 2015 when Ariana Miyamoto, who is half-Japanese, half-African-American, won the Miss Universe Japan pageant. She used her fame to discuss the plight of “hafus,” but some in Japan were unwilling to accept her as a model of Japanese beauty. In interviews, Ms. Osaka has embraced her multicultural background.“Maybe it’s because they can’t really pinpoint what I am,” she said in 2016, “so it’s like anybody can cheer for me.”"
"At 17, Amanda Anisimova Bucks the Odds and Knocks Off a Seed - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Amanda Anisimova is seen by many as the future of American tennis, but she sometimes yearns for a second opinion from a third eye.She drives by so many psychic readers around her home in South Florida. “I always want to go in,” Anisimova, 17, said.“I’m kind of scared, because I don’t want to know what my future is going to look like: I want it to be a surprise,” she added. “But I want to hear what they have to say.”No clairvoyance was necessary to see Anisimova’s potential as she dominated 11th-seeded Aryna Sabalenka, 6-3, 6-2, on Friday to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. That victory made Anisimova the first player born this century to reach the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, and the youngest American to do so since Serena Williams at the 1998 French Open.Not all forecasts were accurate, however: Before the match began, a Tennis Australia “Win Predictor” graphic gave Anisimova only a 9 percent chance of beating Sabalenka, who was a popular pick to win the tournament among many pundits and the oddsmakers’ third favorite behind only Williams and Angelique Kerber.“That’s a pretty rough number — I’m surprised by that,” Anisimova said. “But she’s a top player; she’s had such a great year. I was just playing really well, and she was playing really well, too. We had a great match, and it just ended up going my way today.”Anisimova, ranked 87th, is likely to be undaunted by her next opponent: sixth-seeded Petra Kvitova, whom she beat last year in Indian Wells, Calif.“Every player here is going to be great, and every round is going to be tough,” she said. “I just focus on myself, and I’m not really scared of anyone. I don’t fear anyone. I just have a lot of confidence in myself, and I’m ready for tough matches.”Although Anisimova’s ability to dictate play against the ultra-aggressive Sabalenka gained more attention, one of her hardest matches came in her first round against the tricky veteran Monica Niculescu, who plays a game chock-full of funky slices that have driven many more established players crazy.“There isn’t a teenager who would have won the first round against Niculescu besides Amanda,” said her agent, Max Eisenbud. “That match, until today’s match, was her most impressive win. The way Niculescu slices and throws everything at you, it was getting tight, and she was able to perform. A crafty, experienced girl who threw everything at her, and she still won in straight sets.”Eisenbud also represents the player to whom Anisimova is most often compared: Maria Sharapova. While he said that comparisons between the two — blondes with Russian roots who stormed the tennis stage at a young age — were unfair to both, he observed that Anisimova and Sharapova did share a diligent work ethic and an ability not to be fazed in the biggest moments.Frances Tiafoe, who also reached the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time on Friday, gushed over Anisimova, in his own way.“It’s like she’s been a veteran,” Tiafoe said. “She’s going out here, and Sabalenka is playing great tennis — she routined her like it was nothing. It was barbecue chicken for her. It’s unbelievable.”In her news conference Friday, Anisimova said that her confidence was growing.“I believe in myself so much more than I ever did in this tournament,” she said. “It’s just trusting myself. That’s why I have been also playing really well.”That confidence leads her to hope she can follow in Sharapova’s footsteps in another way: by becoming a Grand Slam champion as a teenager. Asked what her dream was for her career, Anisimova expressed a desire for instant gratification.“I want to win this tournament — right now,” she said, smiling.Anisimova, who broke through at the junior level by winning the 2017 United States Open girls’ title, complements her desire for immediacy with an uncommon curiosity about the past, expressing her admiration for Billie Jean King, the pioneer who played a formative role in getting women’s professional tennis off the ground.“Back then it was so different and so difficult,” Anisimova said. “How much she worked, it was just crazy. Everything that she was doing just really surprised me. And that’s something also I remember: I tell myself I’m tired after an easy day — then seeing how much stuff she was doing? It was amazing how much she’s done for the WTA and women’s tennis.”Modern issues are also a concern for Anisimova. She was particularly affected by the shooting last February that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., near where she trains.“I’m not in a little tennis bubble,” she said. “The gun thing, it was so close to home. I know a girl who goes to that school, so it was just very scary. I just thought at the time — and I still think to this day — that guns are very dangerous and we shouldn’t be having them, using them.”Anisimova was born in Freehold, N.J., but drew a blank when asked about the town’s most famous export. “Wait — Bruce who?” she asked. “Is he, like, old?”After a few bars of “Born in the U.S.A.” were hummed and a brief description was provided, Anisimova acknowledged some faint recognition of Bruce Springsteen’s work but said it was unfair to expect more from someone born in 2001.“Yeah,” she said, “how am I supposed to know that?”"
"2019 Australian Open: Players to Watch - The New York Times
Khachanov, a 22-year-old Russian, began 2018 ranked 45th in the world and enters the Australian Open as the No. 10 seed. He gave Rafael Nadal all he could handle in a hugely entertaining four-set match in the third round of the United States Open, and then won the Paris Masters  by defeating four straight top-10 opponents: John Isner, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and top-ranked Novak Djokovic. Khachanov, who is 6-foot-5, has a huge serve and a Western forehand with a long, flowing backswing that suddenly accelerates at the ball, giving the impression that he is a cracking whip. It makes the shot nearly impossible to read. Coric, 22, has not won a match in four previous trips to the Australian Open, but he had an extraordinary 2018: reaching a career-high ranking of 12th,  defeating Roger Federer twice and, with Marin Cilic, leading Croatia to its second Davis Cup title. A left-hander by nature who plays right-handed, Coric is 6-2 with a game that has evolved from a defensive, counterpunching style to a more aggressive, opportunistic brand of tennis. He has developed a superb serve, and his return of serve puts enormous pressure on his opponent. His two-handed backhand is considered one of the best in the game. His forehand, once a liability, is much improved. Medvedev, a 22-year-old Russian,  rose from No. 65 to No. 16 in the world in 2018 and attributes his ascent to a better serve and more control of his temper. He won in Tokyo in October with dominant serving, dropping just one set as he captured his third tour title. Last week, he reached the final in Brisbane with wins over Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, then lost in three sets to a resurgent Kei Nishikori. A lanky 6-6, Medvedev does not look powerful, but he hits the ball cleanly with perfect timing and with great disguise. He can serve bombs and also hit wide serves with a spin that opens up the court for his second shot. Sabalenka, a 20-year-old from Belarus, opened her 2019 season with a stirring three-set victory over Alison Riske to win the Shenzhen Open. Sabalenka began 2018 ranked 73rd, but under the tutelage of Dmitry Tursunov, a former tour player, she has risen to No. 11 by harnessing her prodigious power game and staying in points longer with improved shot selection. Her breakthrough came in the Cincinnati event in August, when she reached the semifinals with wins over Johanna Konta, Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Garcia and Madison Keys. She followed that by winning the Connecticut Open in New Haven, and then upsetting Petra Kvitova to reach the fourth round at the United States Open. The 6-foot Sabalenka serves with power and heavy spin, backing that up with a fearsome Western forehand. But what really makes her a threat is the way she plays fearlessly in the big moments of a close match.Barty, a 22-year-old Australian, had a breakout season in 2018, winning her first Grand Slam doubles title at the United States Open (with CoCo Vandeweghe), and reaching a career-high singles ranking of 15th. In Sydney last week, she upset world No. 1 Simona Halep in straight sets. Barty has an exceptional all-court game, using her athleticism and wide array of shots to confound opponents. Although she is only 5-5, Barty leads the WTA Tour in second serve points won, using her heavy kick serve to pull the returner out of position and then attacking the first ball with her powerful forehand. With her superb volleys and overhead, Barty looks to attack the net, often approaching behind her one-handed slice backhand, which is considered the best in the game. Expect the Australian fans to turn Barty’s matches into rollicking events.Keys, a 23-year-old American who was the runner-up to Sloane Stephens in singles at the 2017 United States Open, last year reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, as well as the semifinals of the French Open and the United States Open. But her other results were somewhat lackluster, and she enters this week ranked 17th. Keys struggled to find a coach to replace Lindsay Davenport, who stopped traveling to spend more time with her family. In December, Keys hired Jim Madrigal, who guided Tennys Sandgren on his run to the quarterfinals in Melbourne a year ago. At 5-10, Keys has one of the game’s best first serves, and she generates astonishing pace with her ground strokes. But she ranks only 27th on tour in second serve points won, at just over 47 percent. An improvement in this area could pay off for Keys. "
"A Wiser Naomi Osaka Adjusts to Stardom, Even as She Briefly Stumbles - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Deservedly No. 1 in the world at age 21, Naomi Osaka has not made it past the round of 16 in her first two tournaments wearing the crown.After stumbling at the first hurdle in Dubai last month, she won two matches here in Indian Wells before running into Belinda Bencic.Though it is too early to start scurrying around the halls and sounding the alarms, it is not too early to observe that Osaka is in the midst of an adjustment process that could take more time to work through than she imagined.In a little more than six months, the Japanese-American with Haitian roots has become a multicultural star with global reach, fired the coach who helped her zoom to No. 1 by winning two Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and hired a new coach who had yet to be a head coach at this level.It is a lot to handle, a lot to digest, particularly with people like me poised to parse every performance for signs of trouble.Bencic gave her plenty to digest, beating Osaka at her own game on Tuesday by taking time and the initiative away as she ended Osaka’s title defense in just 66 minutes in the round of 16 by the no-argument score of 6-3, 6-1.“Naomi was rushed and didn’t have time to dictate,” said Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion. “I don’t think Naomi had come across a player like that. All these big hitters like Aryna Sabalenka, and even Serena, are not that close to the baseline. They are two or three feet back. But Bencic plays an entirely different game, and she played a flawless match. She’s back, very back.”The proof is in her 11-match winning streak, which includes a title in Dubai and five victories over top-10 players. Born in 1997, the same year as Osaka, Bencic has the skills to challenge her often in the seasons to come if she can keep her head and health together. Bencic will play fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova in the quarterfinals on Thursday.“I think at a time like this with that score line, I would usually feel very depressed and sad,” Osaka said at her surprisingly upbeat post-match news conference. “But I feel pretty good right now, because I think given the circumstances I tried my best, and I don’t really have any regrets. I tried to be positive throughout the entire match. Honestly, she was just playing so well.”It was not Osaka’s first look at Bencic, who turned 22 this month. They first played in a small-money event in Alabama on clay in 2013, and Osaka beat Bencic, 6-3, 6-3, which came as a shock considering that Bencic already was a highly regarded junior player from Switzerland and that Osaka had barely played junior tennis at all.But there was no catching Bencic by surprise on Tuesday. She already had beaten Osaka in straight sets at the 2018 Hopman Cup team event, which is technically an exhibition. And after reaching the top 10 in 2016 and then dropping back because of wrist surgery, she is playing with the point-by-point focus of someone who knows that tennis success, with all its trappings, is not a given.“I know how frustrating it was when I wasn’t able to play at all,” Bencic said, sounding sage beyond her years.Osaka sounds a bit wiser herself. The meandering, sometimes cryptic interviews of 2018 have given way to something more considered and open with occasional dashes of her trademark whimsy.This is not a coincidence. She watched clips of her past news conferences and did not like some of what she saw: the “ums,” the “likes.” At this new stage, she greets questions, of which there are many, with respect, giving the impression that she is weighing each one before answering.Asked to compare herself now with when she won Indian Wells as an unseeded player in 2018, she gave another measured response, even in defeat.“I guess one of the biggest things is I wanted to be more mature,” she said. “I feel like this is something I’m still working on — on and off the court. It’s one of the biggest goals that I have had in my entire life.”“I might have thrown a few tantrums last year,” she added. “And this year it’s something that I’m working on improving, and I feel like it’s going well. I think I’m just more confident in myself.”Dismissing Sascha Bajin, her silken-voiced German coach, was certainly a bold move. Under his guidance, she defeated Serena Williams, Bajin’s former employer, twice in 2018: once in the first round in Miami and once under much more duress in the United States Open final. With Bajin still by her side, but apparently no longer in her confidence, Osaka fought through another rough-and-tumble draw to win the Australian Open in January.Neither has explained their split in detail, although Osaka has said it was not a matter of money. She or some members of her team were looking for a lower-profile coach, but there were clearly personal issues at work, too.“Something happened that must not have been good, although that’s just speculation,” said Evert, who often watched Osaka and Bajin train in Boca Raton, Fla. “They were laughing and having fun practices and teasing each other, and it was great, and then just before the Australian and after the Australian, it was tense.”Bajin is gone now, replaced by Jermaine Jenkins, a former standout at Clemson University who spent several years as the main hitting partner for Venus Williams, who dismissed her coach, David Witt, and Jenkins in the off-season.Jenkins was quickly hired as a national coach by the United States Tennis Association to work out of its national campus in Orlando. He was just settling in when he got a text message from Osaka’s agent, Stuart Duguid, inquiring about his availability.“I had a great new gig at the U.S.T.A., and I was doing my expense report and I get that text message,” Jenkins said with a chuckle this week. “When a great adventure is offered to you, you cannot refuse it.”Jenkins, 34, knows full well that job security at this level is fragile, which is one of the big reasons he was drawn to the U.S.T.A. post.“My wife and I live there in Lake Nona,” he said. “Plus, with the coaching carousel, I didn’t want to go back out with another player and then they wake up on the wrong side of the bed and say, ‘Hey I’m not feeling this.’ I was thinking more about security because there are only a few, I feel like, out there that are worth being out here for.”Osaka, with her talent and star power, is certainly on that short list, and she and Jenkins are now 2-1 after their first tournament together, which included one on-court coaching visit that Osaka jokingly began by suggesting she was having a midlife crisis.“I just wanted to break the ice,” she said.Keeping the mood light and keeping tennis in perspective seem like the right idea when there are all sorts of new and powerful forces at work, including celebrity and megamillions.This also seems a good time for Osaka to remember that the controlled power and controlled emotion that she displayed to win in New York and again in Australia were anything but a fluke."
"Roger Federer’s 101 Titles: By the Numbers - The New York Times
On March 2 in Dubai, Roger Federer joined Jimmy Connors as the only male tennis players in the open era with 100 career titles. With a victory on Sunday over John Isner in the final of the Miami Open, Federer, 37, is now eight titles behind Connors’s record of 109. Here’s a look at Federer’s 101 titles.The date Federer won his first career title, at age 19, in Milan, defeating Julien Boutter of France, 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-4. Federer was ranked 27th at the time, Boutter 67th. Boutter reached only two finals on the ATP Tour, winning one, and reached a career-high ranking of 46th. His last tour event was Wimbledon in 2004, a tournament Federer won. (The Milan tournament no longer exists.)Number of Grand Slam titles — eight at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the United States Open and one at the French Open. His most recent came at the 2018 Australian Open.The number of times he has won the tournaments in Halle, Germany, and his hometown, Basel, Switzerland — his most of any events. Number of titles on hard courts, most of any surface. (Hard courts are the most common surface on tour.) He has won 18 tournaments on grass and 11 on clay. His first title, in Milan, is one of only two on indoor carpet.Most titles in one year, in 2006. The first came against Gaël Monfils in Doha, Qatar, in January; the last against James Blake at the Masters Cup, the former name of the year-end finals, in Shanghai in November.The only year since 2001 in which Federer has not won a tournament. He sustained a knee injury in January and shut down his season in late July in order to fully recover. Number of countries in which Federer has won a title, including Japan, Qatar, Sweden, Canada, Portugal, Turkey and the Netherlands. Number of different opponents, from 25 different countries, who Federer defeated in finals — including Novak Djokovic, Jiri Novak, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Mark Philippoussis, Andre Agassi, Igor Andreev, David Nalbandian and Nikolay Davydenko. Twenty-five of those opponents are now retired, according to the ATP. Number of times he has beaten Rafael Nadal in a final, most of any opponent. Who’s No. 2? Andy Roddick, with seven. Number of times he won a tournament final in straight sets. Length of his shortest title-clinching win, a 6-2 6-2 victory over David Goffin in Basel in 2014.Length of his longest title-clinching win, a 5-7, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5), 3-6, 16-14 victory over Roddick in the 2009 Wimbledon final. The victory gave Federer his 15th major title, breaking Pete Sampras’s record.His lowest ranked opponent in a final, but it was a familiar name. On Oct. 2, 2005, Federer, then 24, defeated 18-year-old Andy Murray, 6-3 7-5, in the final of the Thailand Open in Bangkok. It was the first of 25 career meetings between the two, and the first ATP Tour final of Murray’s career. Number of times Federer defeated Ivan Ljubicic in a tournament final. Ljubicic, 40, is now one of Federer’s coaches. Number of times Federer has lost in a tournament final, missing a chance to add to his trophy case. Ben Rothenberg contributed reporting."
"Djokovic and Nadal Are Set for Another Epic Duel Down Under - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see that these past two weeks at the Australian Open have been nothing more than a warm-up for Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.Maybe we should have kept from wasting time on the men’s side and gone straight to the showcase, the final on Sunday, when two titans will revive their rivalry and battle once again for the Australian Open crown.The question of who would meet in the final became clear on Friday evening, as Djokovic cruised past the French underdog Lucas Pouille, winning, 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.It was a demolition both thorough and brief, and it mirrored what Nadal had done in his final four clash the night before, when he dismantled fast-rising Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece.Nadal took 106 minutes, lightning fast for a match at that stage of a Grand Slam. Djokovic versus Pouille lasted only 83 minutes, with Djokovic riding his precision groundstrokes and feline quickness to the win.“A perfect match for me,” Djokovic described it. “From the first to the last point.”He looked calmly self-assured as he said this — nothing like the doubtful athlete who struggled through a nasty elbow injury and upset losses in Melbourne in 2017 and 2018, during the one confounding low period in his career. His performance on Friday had a transcendent quality, he said, and he called such a feeling “divine” and “in the zone, where everything flows so effortlessly and you are executing everything you are intending to execute.”He added that the semifinal was one of the best matches he had played on the sea blue center court at Rod Laver Arena.That’s saying a lot.He was speaking, after all, of the court on which he will soon be aiming for a record seventh Australian Open title; of the court on which he won the first of his 14 major titles, when he beat another French player, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, in 2008.It is also the court where he played one of the most stirring, and still the longest, Grand Slam finals in tennis history: the 5-hour-53-minute war of wills he won against Nadal in 2012, one of the greatest matches ever played, after which both players struggled to stay upright at the trophy ceremony.“Hopefully,” Djokovic cracked, “we don’t go that long this time.”You never know.Djokovic brawling against Nadal for the 53rd time — Djokovic leads, 27-25 — is expected to scintillate. It may awaken memories of when the two were younger, fresher, but not necessarily better, versions of what they are today, when they seem far and away the two best on the planet, their old rivals diminished or injured or close to retirement, their new rivals not ready yet.For sports fans in the United States, this is one of those events worth setting the clock for, a match scheduled to start at the very uncivilized time of 3:30 a.m. Eastern on Sunday.Just as in the run-up to the 2012 final, the Serb, Djokovic, is ranked No. 1 in the world, and the Spaniard, Nadal, is No. 2 and nipping at his heels.But seven years on, they are also very different. The Nadal of Melbourne 2019 is riding a game he has clearly modified for this event — a change made, he has acknowledged, as an adaptation to being 32.Here, at a tournament in which he has not lost a single set, he is looking to keep his legs spry, his troublesome knees healthy. He is hitting more balls on the short hop, sticking closer to the baseline, volleying more. He has also streamlined his service motion, cutting fat from his windup in a search for more accuracy and greater pop.Djokovic can see the difference. Speaking of the man he described as his primary rival (take that, Roger Federer), Djokovic noted that the changes were working for Nadal.“I think he’s backing his first shot up with that great serve, saving energy, and then he can go for more in the return game,” Djokovic said. “With everything he possesses, all the qualities in his game, adding a lot of free points on the serve makes him much tougher to play against.”Both players have had to adapt, had to overcome recent difficulty, to get to this point. Nadal arrived in Melbourne with low expectations, having taken a hiatus from the tour after last fall’s United States Open, where he withdrew in the semifinals, citing a leg injury. In November, he had ankle surgery.Dogged by his injured elbow at last year’s Australian Open, Djokovic was routed in the quarterfinals by Hyeon Chung, a South Korean ranked No. 58 at the time. That loss was one of a batch of stunning upsets he suffered in major championships after winning the French Open in 2016. Plenty of questions were swirling around him at the time. He often wore a hangdog, puzzled look on his face during matches, where once there had been nothing but ice-cold surety.Would he ever return to form?But then, last summer, after elbow surgery and a remodeling of his priorities and his coaching team, the old Djokovic emerged. His health returned. So, too, did his steel-trap resolve. He won Wimbledon, beating Nadal in a five-set marathon that Djokovic credited here with giving “a different, more confident self.”Later in the summer, he won his 14th Grand Slam at a sweltering U.S. Open, tightening his grip on the top of the men’s rankings.Now he finds himself again in a Melbourne final, with a chance to repeat the glory of 2012, a chance for a 15th Grand Slam, just two behind the Spaniard’s haul of 17, within striking distance of Federer, who sits at 20 for most in a career.At his postmatch news conference, I asked Djokovic to imagine a future conversation with his two children, who were not yet born seven years ago, and how he would describe that last epic Melbourne night against Nadal.“How would I describe it?” he said, pausing before adding a touch of humor. “I’ll probably not have them sit down and watch it because I don’t like my children to watch TV that long.”Then he grew serious.“I would probably present it in more a general concept of our rivalry. That match would be icing on the cake.”On Sunday, seeking a seventh Australian Open title, he will have the chance to add more icing, indeed a whole extra layer, to that cake, to the legacy of a glorious career."
"At Australian Open, Osaka Holds Off Hsieh, a Big-Seed Slayer With a Bedeviling Slice - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — The reigning United States Open champion, Naomi Osaka, was serving to extend her third-round match against Hsieh Su-Wei when she rolled her right foot while running for a ball and tumbled to the ground, prompting the chair umpire to ask if she was O.K.“No,” Osaka replied, but she was laughing.Osaka, 21, who was born in Japan and is based in Florida, had already squared herself once, picking her game up after dropping the first set and falling behind 2-4, 0-40 in the second against Taiwan’s Hsieh, a big-seed slayer with a bedeviling slice.By rising to hold off Hsieh 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, Osaka showed that she is more than O.K. She proved that she is maturing in front of everybody’s eyes like a Polaroid picture.Osaka’s round of 16 opponent is Anastasija Sevastova, whom she defeated in three sets — after dropping the first — in the quarterfinals of a tuneup event in Brisbane two weeks ago. Osaka struggled with her composure early on against Sevastova in what turned out to be a prelude to a hissy fit.In a straight-sets semifinal loss to Lesia Tsurenko, Osaka came unstrung. She committed 26 unforced errors, was broken three times and sulked between shots in a display that she apologized for later on her Twitter account.“Had the worst attitude on the court today,” Osaka wrote. “Sorry to everyone that watched. I keep telling myself to be more mature but seems it’ll take a while.”Fast forward to Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne two weeks later. In the first set against Hsieh, Osaka produced 20 unforced errors and was broken three times. So upset was Osaka by her start that she kicked her racket on the changeover before the second set, an act of petulance that resulted in her receiving a code violation.“Of course I would have preferred not to do that, and I’m really sorry that I did,” Osaka said. “But hopefully I’ll learn from that moment.”It seemed that Osaka had learned nothing from Brisbane when she stood five points from defeat. But a funny thing happened on her way to another dispiriting result. Osaka laughed at her plight, and that moment of mirth acted like a release valve, letting out all the pressure that had been building since she dispatched Serena Williams in straight sets in New York to win her first major title.Instead of feeling, as she put it, “that either I win the match or I die,” Osaka relaxed and started playing calmer, smarter points, blasting her way into the tournament’s second week.“She was just playing so well,” Osaka said, referring to Hsieh, “and I think I got overwhelmed. And then early in the second set I tried doing things that I know isn’t necessarily my game, like I was trying to hit higher balls and I don’t even practice doing that.”She added, “Then after a while, I just started thinking that I’m in a Grand Slam. I shouldn’t be sad; I’m playing against a really great player so I should just enjoy my time and try and put all my energy into doing the best that I can on every point.”In both her title runs in 2018, at Indian Wells and Flushing Meadows, Osaka won every first set. Her overall record last year when she lost the first set was 2-19. So she is pleased to have already posted two victories, against Sevastova and Hsieh, this month after slow starts.“I think the more matches that I play like this, the tougher ones, then maybe as I go on it won’t seem as hard,” Osaka said, adding: “I’m happy with how I fought. For me, that’s one of the biggest things I always thought I could improve, because it sort of seems like before I would accept defeat in a way.”Hsieh presented a stout test because the bigger the stage, the better she seems to play. At last year’s tournament, Hsieh upset the third-seeded Garbiñe Muguruza and the former women’s world No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska before taking the former champion and ex-women’s world No. 1 Angelique Kerber to three sets.But as Osaka showed against Serena Williams in their U.S. Open final, she too embraces the big stage. “There is the most attention during Grand Slams, and more people come out than anywhere else,” Osaka said. “So definitely it makes me really happy, and I try to sort of channel that in my tennis.”When Osaka is home, she trains at the academy in Boca Raton, Fla., run by the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Chris Evert and her brother, John.“She’s very nice,” Osaka said, referring to Evert. “Whenever I do see her, she always comes up and says a lot of encouraging words, so I’m really grateful for her.”Osaka’s eyebrows danced as she divulged a secret. Whatever advice Evert offers, Osaka absorbs it without question. For some reason, she added slyly, her coach, Sascha Bajin, and Evert can say the exact same thing, but it really resonates when Evert says it.“Not that I’m, like, ragging on Sascha,” Osaka said, grinning, “but it feels like I should listen to her more in a way because — oh, I’m going to get so much hate — I have seen what she did and she’s also played. So it’s a little bit more believable.”Before the tournament began, Evert described Osaka as “reliable.” And here Osaka is, right on schedule, two victories from a potential rematch with Williams in the semifinals.Reliable? Yeah, that’s believable."
"WTA Brings Coaches to the Forefront (Except During Matches) - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — To show a fuller picture of the sport, women’s tennis is shining the spotlight on the coaches who travel the tour with its players.For 10 years, the WTA has allowed on-court coaching at regular tour events. At this year’s Australian Open, coaches have given news conferences of their own, following their players to the podium after matches. Last season, for the first time, the WTA awarded a Coach of the Year Award, which went to Naomi Osaka’s coach, Sascha Bajin.But nothing drew more attention to tennis coaches than one getting in trouble. Coaching during a match is not allowed at Grand Slam tournaments, and Serena Williams was assessed a code violation in the women’s final at the United States Open in September when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, spotted her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gesturing toward her from his seat. His hand movements were replayed as much as any shot from the tournament.Williams’s ire over the penalty, which she felt was akin to calling her a cheater, set off a series of penalties that overshadowed the match, which was won by Osaka.Afterward, Mouratoglou admitted to making the signals, but added, “Everyone is doing it, 100 percent of the time.”Four months later, at the Australian Open, he continued to insist that the rules should change because coaching from the stands is already “completely tolerated — except for one or two people who think they’re different.”Ramos is officiating matches at this tournament, but he was not assigned to one featuring Williams, who lost in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. At least one prominent player — the men’s semifinalist Stefanos Tsitsipas — has been cited for illegal coaching in Melbourne.“I think it should become legal because we stop hypocrisy, first of all,” Mouratoglou said. “Second, because it’s great for the show, and we want to have viewers who are not 50 years old. We want to attract the young generation, and we’re not. Tennis is not attracting the young people. And third, I think it’s good for the players.”Despite the WTA’s calling for coaching to be allowed across the sport after the incident at the U.S. Open, neither the men’s tour nor the Grand Slam tournaments have moved in that direction.Steve Simon, the WTA chief executive, said that coaches “contribute an integral element to the on-court and off-court WTA story.”Simon’s predecessors have seen coaches as resources for enriching its product before. Allowing on-court coaching 10 years ago was motivated more by entertainment considerations than any desire for improving tactics.Larry Scott, then the tour’s chief executive, said the rule change came from a desire for “being as fan-friendly as possible and being as responsive to television as possible without altering the fundamentals of the sport.”Holding news conferences with coaches is part of an initiative spearheaded by the tour’s communications manager, Chase Altieri, who came to the WTA in 2017 after working in the N.F.L., where coaches’ briefings have long been a feature of news media coverage.WTA coaches have embraced the program, both for the chance to articulate their views and to ease the burden on their players. Bajin has made television appearances in lieu of Osaka to lighten her schedule of obligations during tournaments.A new section of the WTA website includes profiles of the coaches, with details like their current and previous partnerships and off-court interests. Simon said the goal was to “bring our fans inside our sport.”In recent years, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open have begun with allowing coaching during the qualifying rounds, with players able to walk to the side of the court where their coach is sitting during changeovers if they desire a consultation.Mouratoglou is one of the strongest advocates for on-court coaching, even though his player never uses it. He said Williams’s sense of self-reliance was a weapon he would not dare muzzle.“I think that her No. 1 quality is to be the best competitor ever, and I don’t want her to think that suddenly she needs someone to be a better competitor; that would make her weaker,” he said. “So, for me, it doesn’t make sense for someone like her.”Mouratoglou, who has worked with Williams since 2012, owns a tennis academy that bears his name in France and has been a television analyst for ESPN and Eurosport. He said tennis had many untapped areas that could be mined for entertainment purposes.“Coaching is part of the game,” he said. “If you show it, it’s an incredible adventure for the people to see.”Before the Australian Open began, Mouratoglou even released a mobile game, Tennis Manager, which offers users the chance to simulate recruiting, training and strategizing with tennis players. Its slogan: “Shape a Champion; Become a Legend.”Bajin, who worked alongside Mouratoglou for years when he was Williams’s hitting partner, comes down on the opposite side of the coaching debate, saying the rule should not be changed “to make it more interesting” to watch tennis.“I think it takes away the purity that tennis was,” Bajin said. “My father put me out there on the court in order to become more independent, to learn how to handle problems, to learn how to be by myself, so that nobody can help me — and I think that still parents do that for their kids. That’s why they want them to start this sport, because it’s something special, and I wish we would keep it that way.”But Bajin admitted that he, too, had occasionally tried to send illicit advice from the stands.“Sometimes you try to sneak something by,” he said. “I’m guilty of that.”"
"The Most Famous Man at the Australian Open Is Not Who You Think - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — It can take a long time for Dylan Alcott, a paraplegic 28-year-old from a nearby suburb, to maneuver his wheelchair from one place to another around the Australian Open.He’s not slow; he’s just popular.“People used to stare at me when I was growing up because I was in a wheelchair, and I hated it,” Alcott said. “Now they’re staring at me because they know me. How amazing is that? It’s ‘Oh, that’s Dylan!’ Not, ‘Oh, there’s a guy in a wheelchair.’”After first gaining recognition for winning a 2008 Paralympic gold medal in wheelchair basketball at 17, Alcott has come to dominate the quad division of wheelchair tennis, winning seven Grand Slam singles titles, including five at the Australian Open. He won his fifth in a row here on Saturday at Rod Laver Arena, which seats 15,000.Quad tennis is a small and obscure world, often featuring only four players at major tournaments. But Alcott’s visibility extends far beyond the reach of a tennis stadium. He is the face of ANZ, a bank that is one of the Open’s major sponsors, and appears in advertisements around the grounds and on television. Alcott also served as a courtside analyst for Nine, the Australian network that broadcasts the tournament. During the rest of the year, he works as a radio host for national music stations.When the broadcaster Gerard Whateley introduced Alcott at a meet-and-greet event on Monday, he made it clear Alcott needed no introduction: “You, sir, are inescapable!”Being seen and heard as much as possible is a mission in itself for Alcott.“When I was a kid and I was getting bullied at school and I was really upset, I’d say, ‘I don’t know anyone like me, I don’t see anyone like me on the TV or on the radio or the newspaper, and that sucks! That’s not fair,’” he said. Alcott said he did not grasp the power of his celebrity until his commercials began to air last year.“We got videos of a little kid in a wheelchair, and every time the ad comes on, he rolls over to the TV and hugs it, because he saw someone like him on TV,” Alcott said. “We get hundreds like that, and that’s so cool.”The attention can be exhausting, especially in the midst of competing in a Grand Slam event. Everywhere he goes around Melbourne, people stop, turn and smile in recognition. Though it can eat up hours of his day, Alcott swerves toward those people, rather than away from them, introducing himself and offering to take a photograph.Alcott also has savored the acceptance of his fellow athletes with whom he has shared the locker room, especially the Australian ones who he sees year-round at Melbourne Park. Last Saturday, Alcott chatted with the 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer at the net when their sessions overlapped on a practice court.“It’s like you’re just one of them,” Alcott said. “They treat me so well, it’s amazing. It’s cool, and I don’t think any other wheelchair athletes have that. They say, ‘Hi,’ and it’s like they don’t even know you’re in a wheelchair.”They do notice Alcott’s popularity. Even Stefanos Tsitsipas, who became the Open’s breakthrough star when he beat Federer in the fourth round, deferred to Alcott’s celebrity.“I introduced myself to Tsitsipas,” Alcott said, “and he said, ‘Mate, you’re the most famous guy here, of course I know who you are!’ I’ll take that. That’s surreal.”Kris Dent, an executive with the International Tennis Federation, said Alcott’s appeal transcended sports. “You can't fail to notice that when you come to Australia,” Dent said. “He's become much more than just an athlete. It's a phenomenal story that he has.” The top-ranked man in able-bodied tennis, Novak Djokovic, has tried his skills in a wheelchair across the net from Alcott, which he said made him appreciate the challenge and the craft of the discipline.“Dylan deserves the popularity,” Djokovic said. “He’s a very great guy, very charismatic. I’ve said it before, these guys are heroes to me, they really are. They make the game of tennis more beautiful and more unique because of what they do and how they do it.”After winning Paralympic gold medals in singles and doubles in 2016, Alcott was presented Tennis Australia’s Newcombe Medal, which goes annually to the country’s top player. Alcott said winning an award in a general category rather than one designated for disabled athletes “felt like breaking through.”Alcott was born with lipomeningocele, which caused a large tumor against his spinal cord. He underwent his first of many surgeries at five weeks old. Health struggles continued throughout his childhood, with his ability to use his extremities worsening at times, both gradually and suddenly.In 2012, an inebriated acquaintance tried to pick up his chair and dumped him onto the floor, which was covered in broken glass; Alcott severed an artery in his hand in the fall, damaging his ability to use his right hand fully, which is one of the reasons he competes in the quad division. That spelled the end of his wheelchair basketball career and led him to focus on tennis, which he had started playing around age 9 or 10.“The biggest thing is being really proud of my disability, which is kind of different,” Alcott said. “Most people don’t want to talk about it. I always say, ‘Nah, let’s talk about it, openly and all the time.’ People buy into that.”Though frank and candid about his challenges, Alcott also has tried to share the fullness of his life. “People that have a car accident think their life is over, because road safety ads say, ‘If you drink and drive and end up in a wheelchair, your life’s over,’ as a deterrence,” Alcott said. “People look at me and think it’s the same.”That’s why in his autobiography, “Able,” a best seller published last fall, he said, “I talk about the first time I had sex, when I travel, everything. To be given the platform to do that, that’s so cool.”The platform for Alcott’s tennis also is growing. His second round-robin match, a 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-5 victory over David Wagner, was broadcast live on national television. In his on-court interview, Alcott seemed more ecstatic about the viewership than the victory, hoping that disabled people around Australia had watched and drawn inspiration. (By contrast, he won the United States Open in September on an indoor practice facility rather than a main stadium because of rain.) Alcott, a hip-hop fan who has rapped on stage with Ghostface Killah, started his own music festival, Ability Fest, which catered to the needs of disabled people often left out of such events. The event featured interpreters for the deaf and elevated platforms for seated viewers.Alcott also founded Get Skilled Access, a consulting group that works to improve how governments and corporations interact with disabled people. His foundation finances opportunities for disabled people because, he noted, he needs $8,000 for a wheelchair while his brother needed only $100 pair of shoes to play Australian Rules Football.“It might not be Paralympics; it might be a cello, it might be a scholarship to go to university and become a lawyer,” Alcott said. “Why don’t we see people with disabilities in boardroom, in the mainstream? It’s because they haven’t been given the opportunities, and we want to provide that.”Alcott had a 28-3 record last year on quad tennis circuit, which is for players with at least three extremities affected by a permanent physical disability. He hopes he, too, can grow into something bigger and more powerful than just a tennis player.“I could win 20 Grand Slams and I’d be happy,” he said, “but I’d regret not doing what I love the most, which is changing perceptions of disability, which broadcasting helps.”Alcott said he would like to move to New York or London to reach a wider audience.“Why couldn’t a guy in a wheelchair be the next Jimmy Fallon, or whatever it is?” he said.As he started to expand on his vision for success in America, Alcott stopped and gestured to something much closer: a girl standing a few meters away, staring at him with a huge smile and tears in her eyes.“Hello! I’m Dylan,” he said. “How are you, what’s your name? Jessica, what’s going on? Want to get a photo?”"
"Novak Djokovic Leaves No Doubt in Winning His 7th Australian Open - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — The first point of the Australian Open men’s final on Sunday told the story of all that was to come.With his opening serve, Novak Djokovic stretched Rafael Nadal wide, sending the Spaniard sprawling. Djokovic quickly had his longtime rival exactly where he wanted: off balance and unglued.In a flash, as Nadal spun 360 degrees and scrambled to recover, Djokovic took a half-dozen confident steps forward. He lined up a backhand and then unleashed a buzzing winner that Nadal did not even try for.Point won. Point made. Rafael Nadal: toast.The match, held at Rod Laver Arena on a warm and slightly breezy evening, finished just 2 hours 4 minutes later, Djokovic winning in a full-blown knockout, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.This was a win that tightened the 31-year-old Serb’s hold on the top spot in men’s tennis. It also elevated his name once again in the annals of tennis history. He now has a record seven Australian Open titles and has moved to sole possession of third place for major titles, with 15, breaking a tie with Pete Sampras.The three powerhouse sets were as fine and dominating as Djokovic — or anyone — has ever played in a major tournament final.“It ranks right at the top,” Djokovic said, assessing his performance at a news conference. “At this level, under these circumstances, it was truly a perfect match.”He could not have seen this coming. Nobody could.Djokovic versus Nadal, No. 1 vs. No. 2, was arguably the most anticipated match of the tournament. It was the first occasion in which these two tense rivals — who have now played 53 times on tour, with Djokovic winning 28 — had met in the finals of a Grand Slam event since 2014, when Nadal slipped by Djokovic in four sets at Roland Garros in Paris.Given the scintillating way both had performed throughout the tournament, with Nadal winning every set he played in his first six matches and with Djokovic winning all but two, it seemed certain that they would duel once again deep into the Melbourne night.It was a match that was expected to dust off hallowed memories of what might have been their greatest combined moment of glory. In 2012, the two played one of the most epic finals in Grand Slam history, right on Laver’s sea-blue center court: a 5-hour-53-minute marathon won by Djokovic, the longest major final ever.But a reprise was not to be. What unfolded was not even a reasonable facsimile.Still, the night had its own way of being unforgettable. The final failed to offer drama, but it did present beauty — that of a top-flight athlete, among tennis’s greatest champions, operating at the very peak of his powers.“Things started so quick,” Nadal said, snapping his fingers twice to emphasize the point. “He was pushing me to every ball. He played so well. He hit so long. His return was fantastic. He was super quick.”Nadal, 32, did not appear particularly downcast after the match. Instead, it seemed as if he had simply resigned himself to the result. He noted that he had been injured and had not been able to prepare for the tournament as he had wished. Indeed, after pulling out of his semifinal match at the United States Open last September and then having ankle surgery, he had not played a match on tour until this tournament began.But he also allowed that there had been nothing he could really do on Sunday against Djokovic, saying it “was unbelievable, the way that he played, no doubt about that.”Djokovic made only nine unforced errors. He lost just one point on his serve in the first set. He aggressively shortened every rally he could, keeping them to an average of five shots, a stunningly low number considering the long-distance finals he and Nadal have slugged out in the past. Riding pinpoint accuracy and depth, he so flummoxed Nadal that the Spaniard once swung and whiffed on a forehand.Nadal, whose tally for major titles remains at 17, three behind Roger Federer’s record, threw all he could muster at the match, especially as it drained from his grip. He worked in as many drop shots as he could. He altered positioning on his returns. He moved early, trying to guess which way Djokovic was serving.Nothing worked.Djokovic led early in every stanza and never looked back. There was no tension. The match was shorter by 23 minutes than Saturday’s stirring women’s final between Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova, which also unfolded in three sets but was blessed by tension at every turn.“For me, one of the most important objectives for the match was to start off well and bring the intensity and make sure that he also feels my presence,” said Djokovic, who looked remarkably calm and centered, both during the match and afterward. “He always makes sure that the opponent across the net feels his presence. That is how he plays. That’s how he behaves. He brings so much energy, jumping around, sprinting.“It was crucial for me to start off with an early break. Having a set under my belt just made me relax a bit more, not really worry too much. After that, it was smooth.”Smooth. Perfect summary.It was a rare lopsided Grand Slam final between men’s tennis greats, reminiscent of Nadal’s wipeout of Federer at the 2008 French Open and John McEnroe’s rout of Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in 1984.But it should not be forgotten how far the two came to get to the finals, the hurdles overcome. There is Nadal with his injuries, which have piled up over the years, especially on hard courts. There is Djokovic with the way he struggled with his confidence and his health after winning the French Open in 2016. For two full tennis seasons, it felt as if he was lost in the wilderness, in matches including a fourth-round loss at Melbourne Park last year to the unseeded South Korean Hyeon Chung.Djokovic underwent elbow surgery not long after that match. At first, the operation did not help his on-court results. He appeared to be a doubting and unhappy shadow of his self. Improbably, he found his game on the Wimbledon grass, winning the title there and then following that up with another championship at the U.S. Open in September.According to the International Tennis Federation, Djokovic is the first man to record three streaks of three or more Grand Slam titles in a row. He won four straight from Wimbledon in 2015 to the 2016 French Open, and three in a row from Wimbledon in 2011 to the 2012 Australian Open.His chance to hold all four major titles at the same time will come in four months at the French Open, which he has won only once (Nadal has been the champion at Roland Garros 11 times).Sustain this level through the United States Open, and it is not impossible to imagine him winning a calendar-year Grand Slam. No man has done that since Rod Laver in 1969.And what about reaching Federer’s record 20 Grand Slam titles?Asked about those milestones on Sunday, Djokovic was his typically reflective self.“I am aware that making history of the sport that I truly love is something special,” he said.He then gave a nod to the kind of uncertainty that he knows very well, firsthand: the way injuries and loss of confidence can shake the very best of foundations. There are no sure bets.“How many seasons are to come? I don’t know,” he added, noting that he was trying hard not to get too far ahead of himself. “I do want to definitely focus myself on continuing to improve so I would be able to compete at such a high level for the years to come — and have a shot at eventually getting closer to Roger’s record.“It’s still far.”True, but if he keeps playing in the fluid, focused way he did on this Sunday evening in Melbourne, 20 Grand Slams will come into focus soon enough."
"At the Australian Open, Young American Men Seize the Moment - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Could the 2019 Australian Open be the Grand Slam tournament in which a budding cast of young American men breaks through?The odds remain against that happening — thanks in part to a guy named Roger Federer — and there remains much tennis to be played. But after a pair of second-round upsets by Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz on Wednesday, the stage just might be set.The first surprise came when Tiafoe, who turns 21 on Sunday, finished off fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson behind powerful forehands and serves. It was the biggest win of Tiafoe’s young career and the biggest shock of the tournament so far.“C’mon!” he shouted, rolling up his right shirt sleeve, then thumping his right biceps repeatedly with his left hand, a move that seemed freighted with both bravado and relief. Tiafoe, the son of immigrants from Sierra Leone who learned the game at the Maryland tennis club where his father was a custodian, has long been touted as a prodigious talent. But he has also seemed burdened by the weight of expectations.“It means the world to me,” Tiafoe told a crowd he had clearly won over during the tense three-hour match.The arena scoreboard flashed with the final score, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5, telling a story of its own. Early on, Anderson had pushed ahead, leading by 3-0 in the second set after winning the first. Then Tiafoe turned the tide.“I lost to Kevin three times last year,” Tiafoe, ranked No. 39, explained in an on-court interview. “I was down a set and break today. I went to a different place. I dug deep. It’s just how bad you want it, and I wanted it bad.”Indeed, in the beginning, it looked as if Tiafoe might soon be flying home for more practice at the United States Tennis Association’s campus in Orlando, Fla., where many young American hopefuls train. But then he altered his approach — and flashed the kind of game that he will have to employ if he is to get past Andreas Seppi of Italy, a tour veteran ranked No. 35, in the third round.He had decided to “kind of just mix it up,” he explained. “Play smarter. Don’t try to go for cannons. Be unpredictable.” Once he settled on a game plan, Tiafoe was particularly effective mixing a slew of low-bouncing slices into his powerful repertoire, forcing Anderson out of his comfort zone, making Anderson bend and contort his 6-foot-8 frame.How far can Tiafoe go at this tournament? When I posed that question to him, he was succinct. “To the third round, man,” he said, before laughing slyly.Should Tiafoe beat Seppi on Friday, he would find himself deeper in a Grand Slam tournament than he has ever been. Maybe because he’s keenly aware of that fact, he leaned on a tried-and-true sports cliché — but one that might show he has enough locked-in maturity to do real damage right now. He said he couldn’t afford to consider anything more than the next match.“Look at today, I mean, he is five in the world,” Tiafoe said, referring to Anderson, who is actually ranked No. 6. “I was able to beat him. It’s so tight now. Anybody plays a good match, you can beat anybody on a given day.”Fritz, 21, a Californian ranked 50th, can only hope those last words ring true. Shortly after Tiafoe’s win, Fritz upset 30th-seeded Gaël Monfils of France, 6-3, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5). The match featured some of the most exquisite shotmaking of the tournament’s opening days.Like Tiafoe, Fritz has never advanced past the third round of a major. But Fritz’s next opponent is Federer, the two-time defending champion and No. 3 seed. The two have played only once: Federer won a tight three-setter on grass in 2016, as Fritz was just starting out on the tour.“I learned my lesson last time we played,” Fritz said. “I won the second set, and it was one of the most amazing feelings I have ever had playing tennis, winning a set off Roger Federer! And then we were deep in the third and I had a chance to break his serve, and I started thinking: Oh my God, I am about to beat Federer. I might beat Federer.“And then that thinking definitely lost me the match pretty quick. I didn’t win another game after that. I have definitely learned I just have to treat it like any other match.”Playing Federer in Melbourne will not be any other match, of course. Same for Tiafoe, when he battles Seppi. But both matches present a real opportunity.“Between Frances and Taylor today, we saw something different, something better, an intensity and composure I have never seen before,” said Martin Blackman, the U.S.T.A.’s general manager for player development. “All of our players can learn from this.”Blackman oversees a group that includes the 7-footer Reilly Opelka, 21, who upset ninth-seeded John Isner on Monday before losing a five-setter on Wednesday, and Mackenzie McDonald, 23, the former N.C.A.A. champion who fell in four tight sets to sixth-seeded Marin Cilic.If any of the young American men are to begin making a bona fide dent in pro tennis, there is no better time to start than now."
"Serena Williams Defeats Simona Halep, Ranked No. 1. Anyone Surprised? - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Simona Halep of Romania is ranked No. 1 in the world in women’s tennis. Last season, she won her first Grand Slam title, on the red clay of Roland Garros.On Monday night at Melbourne Park, she faced an opponent who, if judged by the numerical listing spit out by the pro tour’s computer, should have been handled by Halep with relative ease. Except that player, currently ranked 16th in the world, is no slouch. That player, in fact, is Serena Williams, pure greatness in fishnet tights.Halep versus Williams in the round of 16 was a rare moment in tennis. It was a match in which the top-ranked player was also the decided underdog. Not only was Halep facing a formidable opponent with 23 major titles, seven of them in Melbourne alone, but she was also confronting someone who had dominated their career head-to-head matchups, winning eight times and losing just once.So it was hardly a shock that Williams ended up improving that record on Monday, rolling past the 27-year-old Halep by a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 score.In the quarterfinals, Williams will now face seventh-seeded Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, who easily defeated Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain, 6-3, 6-1, to advance. Williams has beaten Pliskova twice in three matches, but the one loss came in the United States Open semifinals in 2016. Pliskova, meanwhile, has won all nine matches she has played this season. Williams will be the lower-ranked player when they meet but is again the actual favorite.“I have to return better, but I will be ready,” Williams vowed as she looked ahead to Pliskova. “She’s ready, I’m ready, let’s do it.”It was vintage Serena confidence. And it also stood in contrast to her demeanor at the very beginning of her match against Halep. In those opening moments, Williams actually seemed shaky. She lost her first service game, the product of uncharacteristically poor shot-making and a clunky double fault.But in a flash, Williams got going. Playing with great precision, she continuously sent balls deep and into corners, often for winners.Game after game flew by, six straight in all decided in Williams’s favor. At the age of 37, she simply did not allow her younger opponent to find her rhythm. Total time for the opening set: 20 minutes.“I felt like I’d been hit by a train,” Halep would say later.“I played really good,” Williams said when asked about that first set. She spoke in a plain, matter-of-fact tone.A question came: “Were those six straight games the best you had played since coming back last year after the baby was born?”“I don’t know,” she replied, “but probably.”Still, Halep is among the most tenacious fighters in tennis, and as the match progressed, she began extending the rallies, which is more to her liking and style. She began serving better, fending off Williams’s attacks.“I felt that my level is growing,” Halep said afterward. “And I had more confidence.”And after capturing the second set, there was a brief period in the third when Halep appeared to have Williams on the ropes. Williams looked fatigued, her movements slower and less sure. But midway through that final set, Williams fended off three crucial break points. In the last, she pinned Halep into a corner and blasted a backhand winner down the line.As happens so often in tennis, Halep had trouble bouncing back from missing such an important opening. And as happens so often when Williams seems to be in trouble, she broke serve in the next game, seizing control with a string of strong baseline replies.When the last game of the match arrived, Halep offered meager resistance. Williams had prevailed again. Total time: 1 hour 47 minutes.Afterward, Halep was asked about the dynamics of taking on Williams, and whose confidence should have been higher when the match began.“You are ranked No. 1, and she is Serena Williams,” the questioner began before Halep politely cut him off.“Exactly,” she said.That one word response said it all, for Halep and for all of the women not named Serena who end up at the top of the computer rankings so long as she is playing.Williams now seems to be closing in on her old form after taking time off following the 2017 birth of her daughter. Even with that layoff, Williams still made the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year. At the U.S. Open, she lost the final to Naomi Osaka in a swirl of controversy and accusations of sexism.Williams is on a collision course with Osaka again. Seeded fourth in Melbourne, Osaka advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Anastasija Sevastova on Monday. Osaka next plays sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina and could face Williams in the semifinals.Williams’s goal is clear and right there for the taking. If she wins her next three matches, she wins her 24th Grand Slam title, at last equaling the Australian great Margaret Court’s total of major singles championships.Will she?Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, offered the strongest assessment.“I believe she will,” he said. “She is ready physically, I think emotionally, too.”“She is back,” he added, “to being Serena.”"
"Simona Halep Manages to Beat Kaia Kanepi, This Time - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — For Simona Halep, it was better to think that the United States Open wasn’t held last year.“Never happened,” Halep said, grinning. “That tournament didn’t exist.”Top-seeded Halep was ousted from that tournament within its opening hours, blasted off the court by Kaia Kanepi in a 6-2, 6-4 demolition that sent shock waves through the newly built Louis Armstrong Stadium.Five months and 10,000 miles removed from that scene on Tuesday evening at the Australian Open, Halep was able to build back her sturdy defenses, digging into a gritty first-round rematch and defeating Kanepi, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-4, in 2 hours 11 minutes.Halep, who has had a tendency to give into negativity when being outplayed, did not relent this time. She expressed frustration, exasperation and disbelief after Kanepi struck many of her 40 winners, but remained dialed in throughout.Halep said all she could control was her effort.“I think it’s the best match I played in the last period, not giving up for one ball,” she said. “I think I improved in that direction.”Halep’s consistent, rugged defense eventually outlasted Kanepi’s attacking; Halep hit only eight unforced errors in the final two sets, compared with 36 by Kanepi.Though a first-round win against a player ranked 71st would not normally be a milestone for a top seed, it was a steep test for Halep. Not only had she been clobbered by Kanepi in their previous meeting, Halep had not won a match since, losing three times and pulling out of the year-end championships with a back injury.Halep, who has maintained her No. 1 ranking despite not winning a match since August in Cincinnati, projected no precariousness. “If I’m thinking of all these things,” she said, “I cannot play tennis anymore.”A No. 1 ranked player whose ranking merits a Wheaties box but whose dominance belongs on the side of a milk carton is hardly a rare phenomenon in women’s tennis. Dinara Safina, Ana Ivanovic and Angelique Kerber are among those went through crises of confidence when they reached the top of the ladder. Halep preached contentment, particularly after winning a long-awaited first Grand Slam title at last year’s French Open.“I’m not putting pressure on myself anymore with the results, but I’m still motivated,” she said. “What comes now, it’s a bonus.”Halep split with her longtime coach Darren Cahill at the end of last season, but she projected much of the clarity he instilled in her game — perhaps because the two are still in close contact. Cahill, also an analyst for ESPN, the American rights holder for the tournament, was on her court during pretournament practices.“It’s great to have him around,” she said. “Also it’s tough that he’s not in my team anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. For sure, I need a coach, because at this level you cannot do it alone. I’m just chilling for the moment, and we will see after this tournament.”Because of Halep’s slide, and the even distribution of titles around the top tier of the tour, nine women can leave Melbourne with the No. 1 ranking at the tournament’s end. Halep, who finished the last two seasons at the top, said retaining the spot was not in the front of her mind.“The ranking doesn’t matter anymore,” she said. “I play tennis because I like it. Now my challenge is to win every match I play. I know it’s probably impossible, but I’m trying just to stay with this thought, and give it my best.”"
"Barty Beats Pliskova to Win Maiden Miami Open Title - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Ashleigh Barty defeated Karolina Pliskova 7-6(1) 6-3 on Saturday to win her maiden Miami Open title and become the first Australian woman since 2013 to reach the top 10 in the world rankings. After dominating the first set tiebreak, Barty broke the big-serving Pliskova in a 12-minute game to open the second set. From there on the fatigued Czech, whose semi-final win over Simona Halep finished after 1 am local time earlier on Saturday due to rain delays, put up little resistance.Barty pumped her fists when Pliskova sent a forehand long on match point to hand the 22-year-old the biggest win of her career, which includes a $1.3 million pay check. Barty said the key to the match was extending rallies on the warm day in Southern Florida. ""It was important for me to try to make it physical,"" Barty, the first Australian to win the Miami Open singles title, said in an on-court interview. ""Kaja has the ability to really hit you off the court and take it away from you so I knew I had to have my running shoes on today to try and make as many balls as possible."" Barty fired 15 aces, with Pliskova barely making an effort to return some of them. ""I tried to make the most of it,"" she said of playing an exhausted opponent. ""You don't get these opportunities every single day and it was important for me to continue and try to do the right things and enjoy the moment as well.""Pliskova, who will rise to world number four on Monday, praised her conqueror. ""I'll make it quick because I'm very tired and it was a long two weeks,"" the 27-year-old said.""Congrats to Ashleigh. She played incredible all week, all the matches were close and especially today I thought she came up with some good tennis.""The win capped a memorable week for the 2011 junior Wimbledon champion, who took a break from tennis in 2014 to play professional cricket for the Brisbane Heat. Barty, the 2018 U.S. Open women's doubles champion, is the first Australian women since Samantha Stosur to crack the WTA's singles top 10.  (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"The Coaches Connected to the College Admissions Fraud Case - The New York Times
The coaches led soccer teams and sailing teams, guided water polo champions and budding volleyball stars. At least two had won N.C.A.A. championships. A third gave Michelle Obama and her daughters tennis lessons from his post at Georgetown. The coaches charged Tuesday in a massive federal college admissions fraud scandal were some of the most prominent in their fields. But it was their apparent willingness to exploit their access to the admissions process at several exclusive universities that has them facing federal charges. Who are they? Several had deep associations with the University of Southern California, where Donna Heinel, a senior athletic department administrator, is accused of playing a central role in the scandal. For nearly a decade, Heinel had overseen the admissions of athletes into U.S.C., working closely with several of the current and former Trojans coaches who have been indicted. She was fired Tuesday.Here is a brief look at the current and former coaches identified by a federal complaint.U.S.C. water polo coachVavic won 16 national titles at U.S.C., more than any coach in university history (10 in men’s water polo, the most recent coming in December, and six in women’s water polo). He was fired Tuesday after he was arrested in connection with the admissions scheme. He had coached the women’s team, currently ranked No. 1 and the defending national champion, since 1995 and had been the sole head coach of the men’s team since 1999. A 15-time national coach of the year, Vavic was named the Pac-12 Conference’s “coach of the century” for water polo in 2015. According to the indictment, the co-conspirators in the admissions fraud paid $250,000 to an account that financed the U.S.C. water polo program, and in return Vavic recommended two students as recruits to the water polo team. The ringleader of the scheme, William Singer, known as Rick, is said to have paid the private school tuition for Vavic’s children through one of his company’s charitable accounts “under the guise of a fabricated scholarship.”Former Georgetown tennis coachAccording to the indictment, Ernst, known as Gordie, earned more than $2.7 million between 2012 and 2018 in payments that were falsely labeled “consulting” fees. He “designated at least 12 applicants as recruits” for Georgetown’s tennis teams, court papers said, “including some who did not play competitively.” One such player, listed in the complaint, was encouraged to make playing tennis part of her application essay and claimed to be a top-50-ranking player in the U.S.T.A. for junior girls, which was not true. She was accepted at Georgetown in 2016. A spokeswoman for Georgetown said Tuesday that the university had fired Ernst in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. Ernst, a native of Rhode Island who is in the New England Sports Hall of Fame, was named the women’s tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last August. The university placed him on administrative leave on Tuesday. Wake Forest volleyball coachFerguson has been the women’s volleyball coach at Wake Forest since 2016. Before that, he coached the men’s team at U.S.C., winning 150 matches and leading the Trojans to three N.C.A.A. Final Fours. He was the American Volleyball Coaches Association coach of the year in 2009 and 2012. His success has not continued at Wake Forest, where he was 22-41 in his first two seasons. After Tuesday’s charges were unsealed, Wake Forest announced that he has been placed on administrative leave. Ferguson is accused of accepting $100,000 from Singer in 2017 to help Singer’s client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance to Wake Forest as a volleyball recruit. U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coachSalcedo has been U.C.L.A.’s men’s soccer coach since 2004. The Bruins are one of the nation’s top programs annually, and Salcedo has produced dozens of players who have gone on to play professional soccer. A former All-American at U.C.L.A. who had a brief career in Major League Soccer and other leagues, he has been a member of the Bruins’ soccer program as either a player, assistant coach or head coach for two decades. He is accused of helping two students gain admission to U.C.L.A. as student-athletes in exchange for $200,000. The Los Angeles Times and others reported that he had been placed on leave Tuesday.Former U.S.C. women’s soccer coachesKhosroshahin won a national championship in his first season with the Trojans in 2007, when he was named national coach of the year, but he was fired in 2013 after missing the N.C.A.A. tournament three years in a row. U.S.C. went 8-10-2 in his final season; he was 82-53-15 over all. Janke joined Khosroshahin’s U.S.C. coaching staff as an assistant after playing for him in his previous job at Cal State-Fullerton. A biography of her at the Geffen Academy, a private school in Los Angeles for students in grades 6 through 12, lists her as the physical education department chair. A previous announcement hailed her hiring as the head of the school’s girls soccer program. In the indictment, Singer is said to have contributed $350,000 a private soccer club run by Khosroshahin and Janke in exchange for their suggesting four children of Singer’s clients as recruits. Khosroshahin and Janke were also asked to create misleading recruiting profiles and to serve as references for students who were not competitive soccer players in order to help them gain admission to other colleges. Former Yale women’s soccer coachA third cooperating witness in court papers was an unnamed person whose description closely matches Meredith, who served as Yale’s women’s soccer coach from 1995 through late last year. Meredith was also a participant in the scheme, according to court filings. Meredith resigned as Yale’s coach in November after a disappointing season, but also after, the authorities said Tuesday, he had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of payments to facilitate the admission of a non-soccer-playing soccer recruit to Yale. When he stepped down after last season, Meredith told the university that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.” A month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. Stanford sailing coachVandemoer is accused of taking financial contributions to his championship-winning sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission. “Neither student came to Stanford,” Stanford said in a statement Tuesday. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.” Stanford said Vandemoer had been fired.Texas men’s tennis coachThe Longhorns have one of the top programs in the country, having reached the N.C.A.A. tournament every season since Center took over in 2000. He was placed on administrative leave Tuesday after being accused of accepting $100,000 from Singer in 2015 in exchange for recruiting a student who was not a competitive tennis player. According to court papers, the student’s application to Texas said he played one year of tennis as a freshman, but his other activities included being manager of his high school basketball and football teams. The student withdrew from the tennis team shortly after beginning classes at Texas. "
"Roger Federer Outruns Time (and John Isner) Once Again to Win Miami Open - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — No matter how smooth and imperious Roger Federer looked in the Miami Open final, whipping winners seemingly on demand and breaking big John Isner’s serve on four occasions, Federer knows all too well how fragile this all is as the shadows lengthen.There can be no doubt that Federer is back near top gear at 37. He is moving like a man 10 years younger and has a sparkling 18-2 record this season. After his 6-1, 6-4 victory on Sunday, he is the first man or woman to win more than one singles title in 2019.“Kind of fitting,” Isner said of Federer ending that unprecedented streak of 33 different singles champions. “One of our game’s greats.”Perhaps the greatest, though it remains so tough to compare apples to apples and Federers to Lavers. Comparing eras is seemingly as foolish an errand as writing definitive lists until Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are all done winning, too.But Federer’s enduring excellence is an evermore elegant and persuasive argument, even if the reminders of how challenging it is for tennis champions to endure and prosper were right there in front of him again on Sunday.There was his opponent, the defending champion Isner, 33, suddenly hobbling between points in the second set with a left foot injury that Isner fears could be a stress fracture.“I have never had anything like this before,” said Isner, who began feeling the pain late in the first set.And when it very soon came time for Federer to accept his fourth Miami Open singles trophy, one of the officials whose hands he shook was the tournament director James Blake, one of his former tour rivals who is now 39 and long retired.“Roger, I don’t know what else to say,” Blake said after Federer’s 101st tour singles title. “It just makes me feel like such an underachiever.”Nearly all the stars of Federer’s tennis generation have moved on to other roles: Tommy Haas, one of Federer’s closer friends, is now the tournament director at Indian Wells.Federer made his debut in Miami in 1999 and is the only man who participated that year who is still playing singles.“It’s been a superlong journey for me here,” Federer said. “I got a wild card here in ’99 and made my first final here in 2002 against Andre Agassi.”He went on to win the title in 2005, 2006 and again in 2017, the year when he roared back to the top after recovering from knee surgery.That could have been his last hurrah, but the hurrahs keep coming with titles at Dubai and Miami in 2019 and a very close call at Indian Wells, where he was beaten in three tight sets by Dominic Thiem in the final.But Federer bounced back convincingly in a familiar tournament in an unfamiliar place: Hard Rock Stadium, the Open’s new, much more capacious home after 31 years in the more intimate, boutique setting of Key Biscayne.In 2018, when the event was still on an island instead of in an N.F.L. stadium, Federer lost in his opening round to Thanasi Kokkinakis. Though Federer had another scare in the same round this year against the qualifier Radu Albot, he rallied to win in three sets and then gathered nothing but momentum, winning five straight matches in straight sets.“It’s easy just to say, ‘Well last year didn’t work out, so I won’t come back this year, and as I’m playing the clay, maybe add rather another clay-court event,’ ” Federer said. “But I felt like let’s extend the hardcourt season. Let’s see the new venue. To be honest, I think that was something also I was excited to see. I did feel like the game was there last year, and I thought also the game was definitely here this year even after the Australian Open. So I’m happy with the team, we took the right decision.”The team has also agreed that Federer will play on clay for the first time since brief, unfulfilling visits to Monte Carlo and Rome in 2016. His next tournament: Madrid in early May, which will give him time to reboot and reacquaint himself with the game’s grittiest surface.How confident is he?“Not very confident,” he said. “I don’t even remember how to slide anymore. You know, I’m taking baby steps at this point.”It is smart, as ever, to try to underpromise and overdeliver, particularly when you are entering the kingdom of Nadal, the 11-time French Open champion and most successful men’s clay-court player in history.But Federer, despite his fourth-round loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Australian Open, has certainly had another hardcourt run to savor in 2019.He looked thoroughly in his element on Sunday, just as Isner feared and expected he would.“I knew he was going to play well today; I knew he was seeing the ball very big,” Isner said. “Certainly that was the case. I wasn’t up to the task in the first set, that’s for sure.”Before the final, Federer compared the experience of facing Isner’s serve to that of a soccer goalkeeper facing a penalty kick.If you embrace that metaphor, he made a very quick save, breaking Isner in the opening game, blunting the power with sliced returns on the stretch and then hooking passing shots that even the 6-foot-10 Isner struggled to reach.Federer rolled through his own service games in a hurry. He won all 20 of his first-serve points in the match and dropped only three points on his second serve.Isner, who had not faced Federer in an official match since 2015, would have needed to be very near the top of his game to stop this train or even get into one of his beloved tiebreakers.But he was far from his peak and eventually in great discomfort, limping down the stretch after an injury timeout late in the second set and later wincing and limping off the dais in the interview room.“You hope it’s nothing serious, and I hope he’s fine,” said Federer, who said experience helped him remain focused as Isner struggled. “But it’s tricky, no doubt.”Tricky indeed to remain hale and hearty year after year in a Darwinian individual sport; even trickier to keep holding up trophies year after year with younger men swinging full force across the net."
"Andy Murray Announces Retirement This Year - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Still struggling with a hip injury that has limited him since June 2016, Andy Murray announced Friday that he would retire after this year’s Wimbledon — if not sooner.Murray said that his decision to end his playing career this year had come during his off-season training in December.“I spoke to my team, and I told them, ‘I cannot keep doing this,’” Murray said in an emotional news conference in Melbourne. “I needed to have an end point because I was sort of playing with no idea when the pain was going to stop. I felt like making that decision.“I said to my team, ‘Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon.’ That’s where I would like to stop playing. But I am also not certain I am able to do that.”Murray, 31, became the first British male singles champion at a Grand Slam tournament in 76 years when he won the United States Open in 2012. He won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016 and won Olympic gold medals in singles in 2012 and 2016. Murray reached the ATP’s No. 1 ranking for the first time at the end of the 2016 season, holding on to it through Wimbledon the next year.A counterpuncher who wears down opponents through his elite physicality and guile, Murray earned a reputation as one of the hardest-working players of his generation. He is popular among his peers for an off-court affability that provided a striking contrast from his often ornery on-court demeanor. Murray was particularly admired by many in women’s tennis for his vocal support of their tour and his decision to hire Amélie Mauresmo as his coach in 2014.Andrea Petkovic said that she had been an admirer of Murray “even before he kind of became WTA’s darling.”“He was always my favorite, and I think it will be a huge loss for tennis in general, but also for the WTA,” Petkovic added. “Because even nowadays, when you think everything is equal, you still need men, especially successful men, to speak up for women.”Though often in the shadow of the others in the Big Four of men’s tennis — Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal — Murray is considered by many the greatest sportsman in Scottish history. He was knighted at 29.Just two years later, with a ranking of 230 after the injury layoff, Murray accepted his mortality in the sport. The weight of the decision was obvious in his news conference on Friday, when he broke down after the opening question: “How are you feeling, and how is the hip injury?”“Yeah, not great,” Murray said, his voice quavering. He then sighed and let his emotions flood in, and left the interview room for about three minutes to compose himself.“Yeah, not feeling good,” he said when he returned. “Obviously, I’ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain. Well, it’s been probably about 20 months now.“I have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better, and it hasn’t helped loads. I’m in a better place than I was six months ago but still in a lot of pain. Yeah, it has been tough.”Murray said he still planned to play at the Australian Open, where he is a five-time runner-up. His first match will be Monday against 22nd-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut.Murray’s outlook in Melbourne looked bleak even before his announcement. In a practice match Thursday, Murray was thrashed by his longtime rival Djokovic, who led 6-1, 4-1, before their time slot on the court ended.“I can still play to a level — not a level that I’m happy playing at,” Murray said on Friday. “It’s not just that: The pain is too much, really. I don’t want to continue playing that way. I think I have tried pretty much everything I could to get it right, and that hasn’t worked.”Murray had hip surgery last January, and he said he had seen his Melbourne-based surgeon on Thursday. He said that although the operation had helped, it had not alleviated his pain, which he said had been the “driving factor” in his decision.“I can play with limitations, that’s not an issue,” Murray said. “It’s having the limitations, and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis.”Asked if the Australian Open could be his last tournament, Murray paused and wiped away tears again.“There’s a chance of that, for sure,” he said. “Yeah, like I said, I am not sure I am able to play through the pain for another four or five months.”Murray said that his injury had also taken an emotional toll.“I have talked a lot, way too much, about my hip for 18 months,” Murray said. “It’s a daily thing. It isn’t just people I work with that ask me; it’s everyone. So everyone I bump into, that is all I talk about it. It’s pretty draining.”Murray said that he had spoken “not loads, but a number of times” with psychologists about his injury.“But nothing helps because you are in lots, lots and lots of pain,” he added. “You cannot do what it is that you want to do, and you love doing. Or I can do it, but it’s not fun or enjoyable doing it anymore.“That is what I have done. I have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately. I wish it did, because if it did, it would be feeling brilliant right now. But it doesn’t.”"
"Against John Isner, Reilly Opelka Stands Taller - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — It started as a curiosity, believed to be the tallest match in tennis’s Grand Slam history.And yet by the end of a nearly three-hour slugfest on the Australian Open’s opening day on Monday, fans left less impressed by all of the long-limbed height than by the guts of the surprising victor: the virtually unknown Reilly Opelka — 21, American, 7 feet tall in socks — who doled out an eye-popping upset by defeating his ninth-seeded compatriot John Isner, 33, who stands a looming 6 feet 10 inches.Tennis players in the modern era trend taller than the players of yesteryear, even compared to those of 15 and 20 years ago. But not this much taller. In a sport where the best male players still typically hover around 6 feet (top-ranked Novak Djokovic is listed at 6-2), not only do Isner and Opelka seem like human skyscrapers, they come to the court for each match with the simplest game plan possible: Crush serves, slam forehands and hide their considerable deficiencies in movement by keeping every point whiplash short.Staring across the net at Isner, Opelka said after the match, was like looking in the mirror, and not just because of his opponent’s height.“There’s just a lot of things that are out of your control,” he said, speaking of the distress that comes from playing one of the few who can hit just as hard as he can, and from such high, imposing angles. “I was expecting that today I probably wouldn’t touch too many balls. I was hoping the same for him.”Official match statistics back Opelka up. He did not touch many balls. The average rally lasted two shots. On only four points were at least nine balls struck. Isner slammed 47 aces. Opelka slammed 40, the last a 141-mile-per-hour fastball that Isner barely moved for.The final score underscored how little separated the pair. Opelka, ranked No. 97, won, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5).When it was over, Isner could barely hide the disappointment. He rarely made eye contact during the postmatch news conference. At times, his hands shook with tension.He has long been ranked in the top 20 on the ATP Tour. Last season was his best. He won his first World Tour Masters 1000 at the Miami Open, made the semifinals at Wimbledon and, as one of the top players of the year, appeared in the elite tour finals in London.But last season also started poorly, punctuated with a loss that was in some ways similar to the one against Opelka: a first-round defeat at the Australian Open at the hands of a little known, albeit much smaller opponent, Matthew Ebden, an Australian who stands a tour-typical 6-2.Isner vowed to lean on the fact that he had begun last season in such bad shape — not only being upset in Melbourne but posting an early record of two wins and six losses — before breaking through and winning Miami.“I was off and running from there,” he said. “Just got to get one under my belt and see what happens.”Though hardly one for long answers, Opelka appeared relaxed and casual as he spoke in the wake of the most significant victory of his young career. He spoke of the main difference between him and Isner. In the early stages of his career, Opelka, who is listed as 6-11 but has acknowledged that he is even taller, does not have a deeply successful professional past to hark back to.Hence, even after Monday, his primary motive remains clear: Keep playing well enough that he never again has to compete in tennis’s often brutal minor leagues, where he won two titles at the end of last season to break into the top 100.“That,” he said, “is the immediate goal.”More than making a long run in Melbourne?Yes, he replied, saying he could only allow himself to think of his next match, against Thomas Fabbiano, an Italian who is ranked No. 102 and, compared to Isner, is a relative munchkin.“One guy is 5-10,” Opelka said, referring to Fabbiano. “The other guy,” he added, referring to Isner not by name but with a pregnant pause, “is not.”"
"Federer Wins 101st Title, Beating Isner in Miami Open Final - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Orange streamers rained down while Roger Federer held another championship trophy aloft, his familiar grin as wide as ever.For the ageless Federer, winning never gets old.Now 37, Federer became tennis' first repeat champion of 2019 when he won his 101st career title Sunday by beating a hobbled John Isner in the Miami Open final, 6-1, 6-4.Federer neutralized Isner's big serve and won 32 of 35 points on his own serve. The 6-foot-10 Isner scrambled so desperately to stay in rallies that he hurt his left foot and limped badly through the final few points.Isner said afterward he didn't yet know the nature or severity of the injury.Federer, by contrast, is just fine. He was the Dubai champion on March 2, and runner-up to Dominic Thiem at Indian Wells two weeks ago.""This is a good phase, a good stretch for me right now,"" Federer said. ""I really feel super healthy. That's why I have been able to play every day for the last four weeks. That's something that maybe hasn't always been the case for the last few years. So you appreciate these moments.""Federer is 18-2 this year, best on the men's tour, which stamps him as a threat to add to his record total of 20 Grand Slam titles in 2019.""Unbelievable for you to keep winning and playing this level of tennis,"" Miami tournament director James Blake, a former top-five player, told Federer at the trophy presentation. ""It makes me feel like such an underachiever. We're all just in awe.""Isner also paid tribute to Federer during the ceremony.""You were entirely too good today, entirely too good this whole tournament,"" Isner said. ""You are entirely too good your whole career. It's absolutely incredible what you're doing. We're so lucky to have you in this game, and we all want you to keep playing and literally never retire. So keep it up, man.""The first 33 men's and women's titles in 2019 were won by 33 different players, including Ashleigh Barty in the Miami women's final Saturday. Federer is the first repeat winner in 20 men's tournaments this year.""Kind of fitting,"" Isner said.Federer first played in the Miami tournament as a wild card 20 years ago. He won the title in 2005, 2006 and 2017 before it moved from Key Biscayne to its new home this year in the Dolphins' complex.""It has been a super long journey for me here,"" Federer told the crowd. ""To stand here right now really means a lot after so many years.""The temporary stands inside the NFL stadium were almost full for the final, but Federer quickly defused any drama. He broke in the opening game and then twice more in a first set that lasted only 24 minutes.""Champion, Roger!"" one fan yelled during a lull, prompting cheers. Federer went on to earn the adjective yet again.To complicate matters for Isner, he said the top of his foot started to hurt during the first set, and the problem grew worse as the match progressed.""It's a terrible feeling,"" Isner said, ""going up against the greatest player ever, playing in this incredible atmosphere, and my foot's killing me.""Not that I would have won the match anyway. Let's make that clear. But, you know, I think I could have made for a more interesting match, and one that was a little more fun.""Federer said he felt badly for Isner but didn't let that affect his game.""It was just important to keep on doing what I was doing, and if he's hurt, well, then so be it, and bad luck for him,"" Federer said. ""After the game, of course, you hope it's nothing serious .""While Isner may need time to heal, Federer will begin preparations for the clay court season, which he skipped last year. He'll play Madrid in May as a tuneup for the French Open.""I'm not very confident going into this clay court season, I can tell you that, because I don't even remember how to slide anymore,"" Federer said. ""I'm taking baby steps at this point. I'm very excited. It's a good challenge, a good test. Confidence? It's in no man's land.""In tennis, no man's land is the area around the service line. Federer hits lots of winners from there.______"
"Serena Williams’s Absence Gave Her Foes the Chance to Improve - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Time did not freeze, like a televised sporting event placed on pause, during the 13 months Serena Williams spent away from tennis. The absence of Williams, who has averaged one title in every three majors played, allowed younger players to wade deeper into the draws and grow their games and their confidence.Karolina Pliskova, 26, was already on the rise when a pregnant Williams took her leave from tennis after winning the 2017 Australian Open. The previous year, Pliskova had graced the final of the United States Open, beating Williams on the way. But it was the only Grand Slam event where she advanced past the third round in 2016.With Williams out of the picture from February 2017 to March 2018, the ascent of Pliskova continued apace. Advancing to the quarterfinals or better in 15 of 20 tournaments in 2017, Pliskova assumed the women’s world No. 1 ranking that July, two months after Williams’s last stay there.In the eight majors contested since Williams’s last Grand Slam title, at the 2017 Australian Open, Pliskova has made it to the quarterfinals or better in five. With her 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 defeat of Williams on Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open on Wednesday, Pliskova avenged a two-set quarterfinal loss to Williams at last year’s U.S. Open.The way Pliskova pulled out the victory was telling; she played the big points as fearlessly as Williams, 37, once did. Down by 1-5 in the third set, Pliskova won six consecutive games and staved off four match points by swinging for the lines and serving to dime-sized spots. She did to Williams what Williams did to Kim Clijsters in the 2003 semifinals here. In that match, Williams staved off two match points while climbing back from a 1-5 deficit, then beat her sister, Venus, in the final to hold all four major titles concurrently.That Williams had an aura that sometimes all but overshadowed her. The Williams standing across the net from Pliskova hasn’t appreciably changed. In spotting the rest of the women’s game a full year, she simply gave everybody else a chance to catch up to her level of intensity and fight.“This time I just feel somehow different and more confident,” Pliskova said. “I’m not doubting myself.”Williams held her first match point while serving at 5-1 in the third. She was called a foot fault on her first serve. Then at the end of the point she turned her left ankle after Pliskova wrong-footed her. Williams never called for a trainer to treat her ankle.“At that point I didn’t feel like I needed it or I didn’t feel like it would be a big deal,” Williams explained.There was a good reason she felt that way. Many times over the years, less than Williams’s best was good enough.But that no longer is the case.Williams’s serve has always been the weapon she can lean on when all else fails. On Wednesday, Williams didn’t win another point on her serve after turning her ankle.Williams said of Pliskova: “I think she just kind of started playing really, really good. I don’t think it had anything to do with my ankle per se.”Williams was right. Did her level of play drop in the last six games? Yes. But to focus on that is to miss the bigger picture. Williams lost because during the year that she spent growing a child instead of a game, Pliskova and the other top players got better.If Williams is to resume her winning ways, she will have to play better than she did in 2017, when she vanquished Venus here for her 23rd major title.It is not impossible. Williams’s mission, if she chooses to accept it, is to forget the past and resolutely move forward, one honest day’s work at a time. The good news for tennis is that she seems committed to the chase of Margaret Court and her record 24 major singles titles.This was Williams’s eighth official tournament since her return from a difficult pregnancy. The golfer Tiger Woods, with whom Williams is friendly, won the Tour Championship in his 18th official start after his return from back surgery. As long as Williams is patient, she can once again prosper.Speaking earlier in the week, Williams’s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said it was unrealistic to expect Williams to hit the tour winning after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. She won no titles last year, but reached the final at Wimbledon and the United States Open, losing to opponents whose masterly performances kept her off balance.“You cannot buy time,” he said. “Things take time. To get back to shape, back in shape after a baby, a few months are not enough. I mean, still she could have won because she’s doing things other people don’t, but it was — I mean, the story said it was too early. That’s it.”Williams didn’t win six majors before her 22nd birthday because she was a patient person. But motherhood is a daily practice in living in the moment, and Williams is nothing if not a diligent student. Earlier in the tournament, she said her year off “gave me a new fire, a new purpose, a new meaning.”It did the same for her opponents, which is why the women’s game is infinitely more interesting now that Williams is back."
"Novak Djokovic Passes His Idol and Sets a New Target: Roger Federer - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — The first tennis player to capture Novak Djokovic’s imagination was a big-serving American with a beautiful one-handed backhand. A grade-school-aged Djokovic, living in the Serbian mountain resort town of Kopaonik, watched on television as Pete Sampras won one of his seven Wimbledon titles, and he fell madly in love with tennis.“I did not have a tennis tradition in my family,” Djokovic said, adding, “To me it was definitely a sign of destiny to start playing tennis, to aspire to be as good as Pete.”Djokovic tried to emulate Sampras’s game, right down to the one-handed backhand, before his first coach, Jelena Gencic, encouraged him to switch to both hands because that was his natural stroke. But on other things, Djokovic refused to budge.Most significantly, Djokovic never abandoned the belief that he would grow up to be the best men’s player in the world, like Sampras, who held the year-end No. 1 ranking for a men’s record six years beginning in 1993, when a 6-year-old Djokovic began playing tennis in earnest.On Sunday at the Australian Open, Djokovic finally and decisively slipped the surly bonds of Sampras. With his 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 defeat of Rafael Nadal, Djokovic secured his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking his tie with Sampras. Djokovic took sole possession of third on the list, behind his contemporaries Roger Federer (20) and Nadal (17).When Sampras retired in 2002, he held the record for men’s Grand Slam titles. Unlike Djokovic, who has peers to push him, Sampras spent his career in a mostly lonely pursuit of a long-retired player, Roy Emerson, who collected 12 major championships, including a men’s record six Australian Open titles.Emerson, 82, attended Sunday’s final at Rod Laver Arena, and, like the 47-year-old Sampras, he had a target on his back. Djokovic’s title was his seventh at Melbourne Park. When he met up with Emerson after the trophy presentation, Djokovic said, smiling, that “Mr. Emerson” was mad at him for breaking his record.The careers of Djokovic and Sampras never intersected — Djokovic turned pro the year after Sampras retired — but their paths crossed in Los Angeles in 2013 when they played together (and lost) in an exhibition doubles match at U.C.L.A. against Bob and Mike Bryan.At the time, Djokovic described it as “a blast” to share the court with Sampras and said he had always hoped to play a match with or against him. Two months before the exhibition, Djokovic had collected his sixth Grand Slam title with his fourth Australian Open crown. But it wasn’t considered a given that he would one day share a piece of Grand Slam history with Sampras, much less move past him.“To surpass him with Grand Slam titles, I’m speechless,” Djokovic said Sunday. “I haven’t had too much time to contemplate on everything that has happened, but I’m planning to do that.”In 2014, Sampras returned to the Australian Open as a spectator, and while there, he sat for a news conference in which he fielded a question about the aging process for champion athletes.Sampras was 31, the same age that Djokovic is now, when he retired. The grind of the tour, especially the extensive travel, eroded his motivation, Sampras said.“As you get older, it just gets tougher,” Sampras said then. “It gets tougher to play. It gets tougher to travel. Sometimes it gets a little stale.”He added: “I just know from my perspective, I was fatigued the last couple years. I was enjoying my tennis, but it was a tough job.”Djokovic understands what Sampras meant. He traveled here without his wife and two small children. During the trophy presentation, Djokovic thanked his loved ones in absentia for their forbearance. He expressed gratitude for all the sacrifices they made so that he could maintain what he described as a selfish existence. He said that it was hard to be apart from his family for weeks on end.“Hunger is always there,” Djokovic said, “but nowadays it’s just more relevant for me to organize myself in life better, to manage to be very concise and concrete with what I do and what I plan to do, because I am a father and a husband. Right now it’s not only about tennis.”After his fourth-round exit here last year, Djokovic had surgery on his elbow, and that was tough, too, he said. He acknowledged having doubts about whether he could regain his championship form.That sounds ludicrous now, with Djokovic in current possession of three of the four major trophies and needing only a French Open victory to complete a Novak Slam.After passing Sampras, Djokovic has no plans to slow down. Many players, Djokovic was told, believe that he can surpass Federer on the major victory list.“How do you live with that?” a reporter asked.Djokovic laughed. “How do I live with that?” he replied. “Just fine.”"
"Kvitova and Osaka Will Play for Australian Open Title and No. 1 Ranking - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — What better way to kick off Australia Day weekend than with a win-one, get-No. 1-free special at Melbourne Park?That will be the holiday bargain on offer inside Rod Laver Arena on Saturday when Petra Kvitova and Naomi Osaka square off in the Australian Open women’s final for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup and the top spot in the women’s world rankings.Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon titlist from the Czech Republic, advanced with a 7-6 (2), 6-0 defeat of the American Danielle Collins in the first of Thursday’s semifinals. Osaka, the reigning United States Open champion, engineered a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Kvitova’s compatriot Karolina Pliskova, who described Osaka’s play as “unbelievable” and said, “There was not much that I could do.”Osaka, 21, can become the first Japanese singles player, male or female, to hold the No. 1 ranking, a piece of history that seemed well beyond her grasp last year at this time when she entered the tournament ranked No. 72.“Of course that’s a very big deal for me,” Osaka said, adding, “I’m just really happy that I’m in the position that I am now, and I’m not going to take it for granted.”Kvitova, who rose as high as No. 2 in 2011, didn’t know that No. 1 was within her reach here. “I don’t really care, to be honest,” she said.Pointing to her head, she added, “I don’t think there’s any room here to think about it.”She feels especially blessed to be playing for another major title. This is her first Grand Slam final since she fought off a knife-wielding burglar in her Czech Republic apartment in 2016. She sustained nerve and tendon damage in all five fingers of her dominant left hand in the attack, requiring hours of surgery to repair and sidelining her from competition for five months.“I didn’t know even if I was going to play tennis again,” Kvitova said, adding, “It wasn’t only physically but mentally was very tough, as well. It took me really long while to believe.”Since returning for her self-described “second career” at the 2017 French Open, the 28-year-old Kvitova has won seven tournaments, including five last year.She started 2019 on a high note, prevailing in the tuneup event in Sydney. But for all her success, she had struggled in the majors; after winning Wimbledon for the second time in 2014, Kvitova didn’t advance to the semifinals in her next 16 Grand Slams. Her best showing was two quarterfinal appearances at the U.S. Open.“For the mental side, it wasn’t really easy to kind of deal with that every time, coming to the Grand Slam and losing,” Kvitova said. “Maybe that’s why it’s probably more sweet.”Osaka may be in her second consecutive major final, but she can remember when making it to the second week was a major victory. Before her breakthrough against Serena Williams last year in Flushing Meadows, Osaka lost in the third round of Grand Slams seven times and got as far as the fourth round only once.“Man, for me it feels like it took awhile,” Osaka said. Laughing, she added, “Maybe my time goes slower than your time. But definitely I remember all the matches that I lost in the third round.”Osaka used to become easily frustrated. The biggest change that her coach, Sascha Bajin, has noticed in this tournament is that she is controlling her emotions better when points don’t go her way.“I just have to tell her grass is green, water flows and everything is all right sometimes,” Bajin said. “Over all, she’s very hard on herself. She has very high expectations. She wants to do well. She wants to get better.”Kvitova was the same age that Osaka is now when she claimed her maiden Wimbledon crown, in 2011. Back then, her career stretched before her like a clear ribbon of highway. Sure, there were a few potholes, but nothing she couldn’t get past. Then came the attack in her apartment.Kvitova said she found out only recently that in the early months of her recovery, her doctor wasn’t optimistic about her returning to competitive tennis.“Luckily he didn’t tell me, like, during that period,” Kvitova said.Last summer, Kvitova met Monica Seles, who arranged the introduction. “It was such a nice feeling to meet someone who kind of went through same things and thoughts and everything,” Kvitova said of Seles, who was stabbed by a spectator during a match in 1993.Seles returned to competition, and won the Australian Open in 1996 for her ninth major championship.“I didn’t know that, actually,” Kvitova said. “It’s nice then.”Whatever happens Saturday, Kvitova feels as if she has already won. “To be honest, I think not very many people believe that I can do that again, to stand on the court and play tennis and kind of play on this level.”"
"Serena Williams’s Practices Add a Wrinkle: A Top Men’s Player - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — After 170th-ranked Christopher Eubanks made it through the qualifying draw of a Grand Slam event for the first time last week, many of his friends from back in Atlanta began to grasp how far his career had come.It was not because of the three qualifying matches he had won, but rather because of who joined him for a practice before the Australian Open began: Serena Williams.“Some of my friends who don’t really know tennis were saying, ‘If he’s hitting with Serena, he must be pretty good,’ ” Eubanks said.His session with her was part of a new strategy for Williams, who is training with some of the best current players from the men’s tour to raise the intensity of her practices. In addition to Eubanks, Williams has practiced this month with No. 15 Stefanos Tsitsipas, No. 21 Grigor Dimitrov, No. 39 Frances Tiafoe and No. 88 Bernard Tomic.Asked about her practices with such players, Williams said simply, “It was fun,” but her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, was more loquacious.“If she lifts her level on a daily basis that much, she’s going to improve incredibly,” he said.The early returns from the strategy have been positive: Williams beat Eugenie Bouchard, 6-2, 6-2, in the second round on Thursday night, thwarting the resurgent Canadian with sharp, focused aggression. Williams was particularly strong on her return, winning 61 percent of points on Bouchard’s serve.Mouratoglou said the shift to finding the best male opposition available was “a long-term plan,” not a temporary trend.“I think that it’s very important in your practice to be challenged, because I think that she can become much better than what she is already,” Mouratoglou said. “But in order to become better, if you’re not challenged, you have no chance. I thought that to be challenged at practice was a good idea, so we tried once and we really loved it.”That first try, Mouratoglou said, was with the Australian player Thanasi Kokkinakis last year at Mouratoglou’s academy in France.“She said: ‘Wow, it was great, great rhythm, and it’s tough. It pushes me,’ ” Mouratoglou said. “I thought she played incredible.”Kokkinakis, who had beaten Roger Federer earlier that spring at the Miami Open, shared that assessment, marveling at his inability to push Williams back from her position on the baseline even with his hardest, heaviest shots.“She’s so, so strong on the ball,” he said. “When I thought I hit some good shots that even some male players might even struggle with, she took it on the rise, handled it pretty well.”Williams has practiced with men throughout her career, usually employing a man as a full-time hitting partner. Most have been years removed from their active days on tour and had achieved modest rankings. Her longtime hitting partner Sascha Bajin peaked at 1149th; his successor, Robbye Poole, reached 414th; her current hitting partner, Jarmere Jenkins, reached a high of 190th.Mouratoglou said that Jenkins was “still hitting the ball really well,” but that it was important to shake Williams out of her routine with him when possible.“She basically knows where he’s going to hit in advance, because she hits with him every day, so there is no surprise,” Mouratoglou said. “She doesn’t feel that she’s challenged because she knows him too well. I think that counts a lot. And she controls him, in a way, because he’s her employee. Even unconsciously, she makes him play the way she wants to, even if she doesn’t try to.“So it’s completely different relationship with a professional player, because she has to give him good rhythm, to give a good ball to him, too, so she can’t lose focus.”Other top men and women have shared practice courts in the first month of the tennis season. Andy Murray and Naomi Osaka, for example, hit together for 30 minutes at a tournament in Brisbane, Australia.Mouratoglou said that he emphasized to the men that they should not treat Williams differently from any other practice partner.He said he told Eubanks, “Play for yourself — it’s your practice.”Eubanks said the session with Williams helped him in his first-round loss Monday against 19th-seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili. Eubanks had set points to go up by two sets to one on a player ranked 150 spots ahead of him.“Serena hits, in my opinion, one of the cleanest balls in the history of tennis,” Eubanks said. “I was working on absorbing pace, because she puts enough pace on it that you’re really working the legs. I’m being as professional as I can, because you’re on the court with Serena Williams. You don’t want her to think you can’t play.”Eubanks said he felt the effects of Williams’s intensity and skill the rest of the day.“I practiced again in the evening, and I told my coach I felt like I did a lift today, because my quads are so sore from just hitting with her for an hour,” he said.After Williams’s victory over Bouchard, the on-court interviewer Jim Courier joked that she should charge the men she hits with for lessons. Indeed, many of Williams’s past practice partners have been thriving in Melbourne: Tsitsipas, Tiafoe and Alexei Popyrin have reached the third round at the Open for the first time.“Just to hit with a legend, especially Serena, it really gave me a great, great experience,” Popyrin said after No. 7 Dominic Thiem retired from their second-round match Thursday. “She gave me some tips after the hit, so it was great.”Tiafoe, whom Williams hit with several times while they were teammates at the Hopman Cup, had his best career victory on Wednesday when he beat fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson in the second round.Tiafoe said he had difficulty handling Williams’s zipping shots, as he was more used to the spinning shots male players tend to use.“I was struggling,” Tiafoe said of hitting with Williams. “She hits the ball so hard. The courts are fast; it was skidding. I mean, a little topspin, maybe? I’m not used to the ball coming in that flat. That was something I really had to adjust to.”Mouratoglou said no man had turned down an offer to hit with Williams.“And I don’t think any will say no,” he said. “It’s a great experience for them, too, and I think they’re curious how Serena is hitting, for real.”For Eubanks, Williams’s story had particular resonance. His father coached him in Atlanta following many of the tactics and philosophies of Serena’s father, Richard Williams.“Being able to see somebody who comes from humble beginnings, somebody who has dealt with adversity her entire life, seeing someone who comes from an unconventional tennis background, it shows it can be done,” he said.“I’ve gotten to the point now where I don’t really get star-struck when I see people,” he added. “I’ve practiced with Fed a couple times. I’ve seen Novak, seen Rafa. You see them and understand that they’re people. But Serena, there’s something about her that’s almost larger than life. So when I got out there and she said my name, it took me back to as if I was a little kid: ‘Man, Serena Williams knows my name!’ ”"
"Federer Beats Anderson to Set Up Shapovalov Clash - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Roger Federer gained a measure of revenge against Wimbledon nemesis Kevin Anderson, beating the South African 6-0 6-4 at the Miami Open on Thursday to set up a mouthwatering semi-final against a player barely half his age.Federer will have little time to rest his 37-year-old legs before his clash against 19-year-old Denis Shapovalov, the highly regarded Canadian talent tipped for future Grand Slam success.Twentieth seed Shapovalov won his battle of 'Next Gen' hustlers 6-7(5) 6-4 6-2 against American Frances Tiafoe.Shapovalov is one of two Canadian teenagers in the semis, with 18-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime to play defending champion John Isner in the daytime, before Federer and Shapovalov face off under lights.Federer has won 100 career titles, 100 more than Shapovalov, and was looking forward to the pair's first match-up. ""He's one of the big shotmakers in the game. I love his forehand,"" Federer said.""It's an exciting draw for John and for myself here, playing these young guys. They are not just young, but they are very good, as well.""The Swiss raced through the first set against Anderson, the man who came from two sets down to beat him in a quarter-final marathon at Wimbledon last year.Anderson took nine games to get on the board but eventually found his groove and broke back with a series of return winners to level at 3-3 in the second set.Federer struck the decisive blow at 4-4, however, winning a marathon game of 22 points and clinching the break with a fortuitous backhand return down the line.""I hit it late and that's why it went short,"" he said of the shot. ""That's not what I wanted to do but maybe what it took. I got a bit lucky there at the end.""CANADIAN TENNIS ON THE RISEShapovalov broke Tiafoe four times and could hardly stop smiling at the prospect of playing Federer.""It's definitely a matchup I have been looking forward to my whole life,"" he said.""It's going to be a dream come true to play him in such a big event. The stakes are so high, semi-final of a Masters 1000 against your idol, it's just a dream come true.""Shapovalov also spoke about what appears to be a bright future for Canadian tennis.He and Auger-Aliassime are in the Miami semis less than two weeks after 18-year-old Bianca Andreescu won the WTA tournament at Indian Wells.""It's kind of crazy to share this with Felix,"" Shapovalov said.""I was just thinking in the locker room how far back we go, from the national groupings when we were eight and nine years old, so it's so crazy to see how far we have come.""It's really great to see him doing well. Honestly, it's not a shocker for me that he's gone this far, that he's doing so well."" (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ian Ransom)"
"Murray Returns to Court After Hip Surgery - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Andy Murray has returned to a tennis court two months after undergoing hip resurfacing surgery.Murray, who has not played competitively since his first round exit at the Australian Open in January, said last month he could possibly play at Wimbledon as he was now pain free after the surgery.The 31-year-old posted a short video on Instagram, where he was seen hitting the ball in an outdoor court while rallying with a wall with a caption, ""It's a start.""Murray had said he was not sure he could play in the singles draw at Wimbledon, a tournament he has won twice, but targeted a possible return in doubles at this year's tournament as it put less stress on his hip.The three-times Grand Slam champion compared his situation to that of American doubles player Bob Bryan who returned to the court 5-1/2 months after a similar procedure.This year's Wimbledon begins on July 1.

"Danielle Collins Upends the Australian Open, and Her Family’s Schedule - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Ann Chisholm contemplated traveling from her Minnesota home to watch the main-draw debut of her cousin Danielle Collins at the Australian Open, but it seemed like a flight of fancy. Collins had lost in the first round of the three majors she played last year, and it made little sense for a relative to travel 10,000 miles to see what might be only one match.But Chisholm continued monitoring airfares after each of Collins’s first three matches in Melbourne, all victories. Then, in the fourth round, the unseeded Collins defeated Angelique Kerber, the 2016 champion and this year’s No. 2 seed.It was just past 11 on Saturday night in Grand Rapids, Minn., when Collins sealed the upset, and Chisholm’s inner voice, which had been nagging her for a week to hop on a plane, grew so loud she could hardly sleep.On Sunday morning, Chisholm reached out to Collins and said she was looking at flights to Australia. Chisholm didn’t want her arrival to surprise Collins in case, she said, it “messed up her mojo.”After Collins reacted enthusiastically, Chisholm, who has four children, asked her husband and her mother if they would watch over things at home if she went away for a few days. Then she called a Delta Air Lines reservation agent, who pieced together a trip from Minneapolis to San Diego, then on to Los Angeles that would deliver her to Melbourne on Tuesday morning.Chisholm had about five minutes to pack for her journey to the Southern Hemisphere, not enough time to retrieve summer clothes from storage. So she threw some shirts and pants into a suitcase, and when her family left for church, she left for Australia.The trip went off without a hitch, and a few hours after landing here in Melbourne, Chisholm was in Collins’s player box at Rod Laver Arena, transmitting positive vibes down to the court during Collins’s 2-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.With the victory, Collins, 25, earned a semifinal meeting against Petra Kvitova, the eighth seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion, who recently beat Collins in three sets in the first round of a tuneup event in Brisbane.“I feel like I’m representing the whole family,” Chisholm said.In St. Petersburg, Fla., Cathy Collins, a preschool teacher, managed a few hours’ sleep before her alarm went off a little after midnight, in time for her to watch television coverage of her daughter’s match. Collins’s father, Walter, a landscaper, waited until after the match to sleep, taking what amounted to a power nap before starting work.The house where her parents live is the only place Collins has called home. Some of the neighbors have known her since she was born. A couple that lives across the street has been running over to celebrate every win with Collins’s parents.“When the doorbell rings in the middle of the night, we know who it is,” Cathy Collins said by telephone.It was a quarter to 8 on Tuesday morning, and Collins’s mother would soon be corralling more than a dozen preschoolers. She had gone back to bed when her daughter’s match was over, and woke up wondering if the victory had been a Technicolor dream.“It’s weird,” Cathy Collins said. “It’s like, ‘Is my daughter really in the semifinals?’”On the other side of the world, Collins described her father as “the hardest worker I know” and marveled at her mother’s stamina.“I don’t know how my mom is managing,” Collins said. “She’s not getting more than four or five hours of sleep on these match nights, and she’s dealing with 15 3-year-olds. She’s a trooper.”So is Collins, who was ranked 35th in the world coming into this tournament with an 0-5 record in Grand Slam matches. She seems unfazed.At Collins’s post-match news conference Tuesday, a longtime tennis journalist from Europe began a question by saying: “I hope you understand that we are used to meeting players when they’re kids. You are different from our point of view.”He went on to compliment her maturity, which Collins attributes to a route less taken. Her family couldn’t afford the elite academies and junior circuits that mold small children into young professionals, so she went to college on an athletic scholarship to get her seasoning.She started at the University of Florida, then transferred to the University of Virginia. Collins won two N.C.A.A. singles titles while earning a degree in media studies and making lifelong friends, many of them non-athletes.“I think not being a child prodigy, not being a superstar at a young age, certainly humbled me, made me in a way work harder for things,” Collins said, adding, “I think it’s kind of made me hungrier in some ways, like not having that, ‘Oh, I’ve always been really amazing at tennis.’ It wasn’t always like that.”Collins comes across as feisty — her mother said she’d had “a fighting spirit” since childhood. Collins also oozes confidence, regardless of circumstances.One of her favorite courses at Virginia was Denise Stewart’s introduction to drama.“One of the things she taught us is sometimes you’ve got to go to your job and you’ve got to sit in that cubicle when you don’t want to for eight hours and fake it till you make it,” Collins said. “And so much of life is acting. You’ve got to always have a positive mind-set.”Stewart said she was not surprised that Collins had found the big stage. Her success, she said, transcends tennis.“She is such the right woman at this time to say, ‘Humble is not my jam,’” Stewart said."
"Roger Federer Shines on Soggy Day at the Miami Open - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Ashleigh Barty waited six hours to get her spot in the Miami Open women's final. Denis Shapovalov needed to pull off yet another comeback to earn his berth into the semifinals.Roger Federer, meanwhile, made winning seem relatively easy.And Simona Halep's chance to return to No. 1 in the world fell apart against Karolina Pliskova.Federer is back in the Miami semifinals, the No. 4 seed winning the first eight games of his match and eventually ousting sixth-seeded Kevin Anderson 6-0, 6-4 as part of a very long, very soggy Thursday at Hard Rock Stadium. He won a marathon ninth game of the final set to break Anderson for a 5-4 lead, then served it out at love.""I got a bit lucky there at the end,"" Federer said. ""But it was a great fight by Kevin and of course I enjoyed the match.""Anderson hadn't lost a set 6-0 since October 2016 — 353 sets ago. He rallied from a break down to get back on serve in the second, before Federer took control at the end.""They just don't happen often enough,"" Federer said of that 6-0 first set. ""I think I played a really, solid, nice first set with very few mistakes.""Mistakes doomed Halep, who lost to fifth-seeded Pliskova 7-5, 6-1. Pliskova was up 5-0 in the second set when play was interrupted — for at least the sixth time Thursday — by rain shortly before midnight. Halep, the No. 2 seed, would have replaced Naomi Osaka as the top-ranked women's player if she won the semifinal.She led 5-3 in the opening set, and just unraveled. Pliskova won nine consecutive games before the skies opened during a changeover. After waiting about an hour for the rain to stop and the court to be dried, she needed only four more minutes of play and finished out the match at 1:11 a.m. — or 6:11 a.m. Friday in her native Czech Republic, 7:11 a.m. Friday in Halep's native Romania.So the day's winners were Federer, Shapovalov, Barty, Pliskova and the rain.""We can't control the weather,"" Barty said.Barty walked away from tennis about five years ago, saying she was basically burned out at 17. She returned three years ago. And now at 22, she's better than ever.The 12th-seeded Barty endured enduring three rain delays on Thursday before ousting 21st-seeded Anett Kontaveit 6-3, 6-3 in the first women's semifinal. Next up is the biggest final of her singles career, against Pliskova.""Obviously, I've been doing the right things throughout the week to put be able to put myself in a position to play for a title,"" Barty said. ""You have to go out there and embrace it.""Barty, who will rise to a career-best No. 9 in the world ranking next week, was to take the court for the semifinal against Kontaveit at 1 p.m. Rain pushed their start time back to 2:08, and the delays were just getting started.They got three games — six minutes of tennis — in before the first in-match delay stopped things for more than two hours. They got another game in before more rain arrived, prompting another two-hour delay.At 7:32 p.m., finally, Barty could celebrate. Kontaveit fended off one match point with a forehand drop shot, but was ousted by an ace on the following point. Barty was down 3-1 in the second, but won the final five games.""Very long day,"" said Barty, who passed the time in the locker room by drinking coffee and watching golf. ""But for me, it's an opportunity to come out and play another match.""Federer is 37 years old. That's the combined age of the two Canadian teens in the men's semifinals — Shapovalov, 19, will face Federer on Friday night, and the 18-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime will meet defending Miami champion John Isner of the U.S. earlier Friday.""It's great for the game because they will carry the sport when we're long gone and we'll be sitting on the couch watching those guys slug it out,"" Federer said about the young Canadians. ""It'll be a joy to watch because not only are they great, great players but they're good people, too.""Shapovalov reached the semifinals by beating 28th-seeded Frances Tiafoe 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2 — the third time in four matches at this tournament that he rallied from a set down before prevailing. And the success for Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov in Miami follows the story of 18-year-old Canadian Bianca Andreescu winning the title at Indian Wells earlier this month.O, Canada, indeed.""Pretty crazy. Everyone is super excited back home,"" said Auger-Aliassime, who wasn't in the top 100 of the world rankings two months ago and now will climb to No. 33 next week — if not higher. ""It's great to hear all these good comments from them. It puts a lot of belief in tennis in Canada. I think all the Canadian players from the young kids to Denis and Bianca and I, there is a lot of belief right now, so it's great to see.""___"
"Serena Williams Turns Back the Clock in Easy Victory - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams dressed for work on Tuesday as though she were intent on reminding people who she was before she became a wife and mother.The last time Williams graced Rod Laver Arena, in 2017, she dispatched her older sister Venus in the Australian Open women’s final while in the early stages of her pregnancy. She was unable to defend her title last year because she wasn’t ready to return to the tour after a harrowing medical ordeal during and after childbirth.In her return, 717 days later, Williams warmed up for her first-round match against Tatjana Maria wearing a short black trench coat. Once she got back to her chair, she peeled off the coat to reveal a muscle-hugging, bright green shorts-and-tank-top set that called to mind the black outfit that Williams wore 17 years ago in a first-round match at the United States Open.It was a bold fashion statement for the 37-year-old Williams, resurrecting the “Serena-tard,” as she called it, which she first made famous in 2002 when she had one of her most sublime seasons, with victories in the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open, and a 56-5 match record.Williams’s 6-0, 6-2 victory against Maria, her friend and fellow mother, felt like it took place in 2002. She breezed through the opening set in 18 minutes and won 54 points to Maria’s 24. Williams, the No. 16 seed, produced 22 winners.“I knew that I’ve been working really, really hard in the off-season to be incredibly fit,” said Williams, who can equal Margaret Court’s record 24 Grand Slam singles titles with a victory here.Maria said she hopes that Williams succeeds. “I have a lot of respect for her for what she’s done in the sport,” she said. “Maybe I was a little bit overwhelmed.”Maria and Williams live near each other in Florida and occasionally get together for barbecues, Maria said, but she did not feel comfortable on the Australian Open’s main showcourt, which is like a second home to Williams, a seven-time champion. “At the beginning, I didn’t find my rhythm,” Maria said.Williams eschewed interviews and kept a low profile in the lead-up to this tournament, her first since her unsettling defeat in the United States Open final last fall, where her outburst toward the chair umpire led to her being penalized a game and fined $17,000. While Williams and Maria warmed up before the match, the D.J. played snippets of songs that included Joan Jett’s “Bad Reputation.” If it was an attempt to get a rise out of Williams, she didn’t engage.She spoke afterward about her dual focus — on tennis when she’s on the court and on her 16-month-old daughter, Alexis Olympia, when she’s not.“Spending a lot of time with my daughter is a priority for me,” Williams said. “As a working mom I feel guilty. I understand that’s normal. These are years I’ll never get back.”Williams can’t get the time back that she took off from tennis after having a child. The best she can do is win the Australian Open title that she couldn’t defend last year, and to that end, she got off to a fast start."
"Teen Shapovalov Earns Early Morning Win at Miami Open - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Denis Shapovalov worked the late-night shift to reach the quarterfinals at the Miami Open.The 19-year-old Canadian left-hander beat 20-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (3) in a match that started following a two-hour rain delay and ended shortly after 1:30 Wednesday morning.The match was extremely close: Each player won 100 points. It offered a peek at the future of men's tennis, with Shapovalov seeded No. 20 and Tsitsipas No. 8.""I knew Stefanos was going to be a tough match,"" Shapovalov said. ""I was ready for a long battle and, sure enough, it went the distance. I'm just happy with the way I controlled myself.""Shapovalov beat a Top 10 opponent for the second time in his career.

"Rafael Nadal Exits, Giving Roger Federer a Day Off and a Final With Dominic Thiem - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — The undercard became the main event at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Saturday.The crowd arrived eager to watch Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal renew their rivalry, a few fans having paid dearly to secure a final-hour ticket to Stadium 1.But Nadal, having tendinitis in his right knee, soon announced his withdrawal after testing the knee in a morning training session.The only men’s semifinal to be played on Saturday at the BNP Paribas Open was between Dominic Thiem and Milos Raonic, and Thiem prevailed, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (3), 6-4, in a match of contrasting styles in which there was only one break of serve.That came at 2-2 in the third set when Thiem finally found a window of opportunity against Raonic’s huge serve (and improved volleying). Raonic struck a forehand into the net while facing break point, and Thiem took it from there despite playing a relatively shaky final game in which he had to save the only break point he faced all afternoon.It will be Thiem versus Federer in Sunday’s final. It will be the ninth final here in the desert for the fourth-seeded Federer, who has won the title five times but lost last year’s final after squandering three match points against Juan Martín del Potro.It will be the first final at Indian Wells for the seventh-seeded Thiem, and it could be quite an eye-catching duel given each man’s flashy style and their 2-2 head-to-head record.But it will not generate the same sort of anticipation as a Federer-Nadal rematch. They have not faced each other in 17 months, and this would have been their 39th meeting in singles. But Nadal, who has had patellar tendinitis for years, felt fresh pain in the late stages of his quarterfinal victory over Karen Khachanov on Friday.Late on Saturday morning, Nadal texted his friendly rival Federer to let him know that he would not be able to play.“For me, it’s not about only today,” Nadal said. “It’s about what it means for me to have to pull out in a tournament that I love so much like this one, and in the semifinals after playing well during the whole tournament. You can imagine that I can’t be happy.”Nadal also announced his withdrawal from the Miami Open, which begins next week and is one of the few significant events he has not won. His decision not to play on Saturday was also made with the goal of preserving his clay-court season. An 11-time French Open singles champion and the most successful clay-court player ever, Nadal said he fully expected to be ready to play on clay in Monte Carlo next month.Federer, 37, appeared in the stadium after the Thiem-Raonic match to give an on-court interview for the fans. Nadal leads their rivalry, 23-15, but Federer has won five straight, most recently in the final of the Shanghai Masters in 2017.“We’ve had so many epic battles, and yes, I know that everyone we have now could be our last,” Federer said. “So was this our chance for the last one? I really hope not, and I really believe at the level he’s playing and I’m still going, there are definitely going to be more.”"
"Far From Serbia, Novak Djokovic Delivers Some National Pride - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Novak Djokovic, the men’s world No. 1 from Serbia, has been lifting up people from his homeland for years, but not usually like this. At the end of a practice session during last year’s Australian Open, Djokovic walked over to a waist-high fence where fans were packed 10-deep to watch him and hoisted a boy from the front of the crowd over the barricade and onto the court.That boy, 8-year-old Novak Pokrajac, then got to play a few points with the man for whom he was named, including a 29-shot rally that ended with him hitting an overhead smash past Djokovic for a winner.Both Novaks are back at Melbourne Park this year — Djokovic, 31, is seeking his seventh Australian Open title and 15th Grand Slam trophy, and Pokrajac, 9, is hoping to entice Djokovic into a practice-court rematch.For the tens of thousands of Australians of Serbian descent, Djokovic is the secular saint of sport, worshiped by Serbs who still feel an acute sense of persecution nearly two decades after the worst of the Balkans’ fractious ethnic violence. That was evident on Wednesday afternoon, when Djokovic hit with the Australian teenager Alexei Popyrin in front of a crowd that included about a dozen fans flying the red, blue and white colors of the Serbian flag. Even during the 50 weeks of the year when the Melbourne Park courts go quiet, Djokovic’s presence looms. In the office off the Serbian Voice, a weekly newspaper on the western edge of Melbourne, one wall serves as a shrine to celebrated Serbian figures from history: Serbian Orthodox Church figures; Vuk Karadzic, the creator of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet; Nikola Tesla, the Serbian-American inventor; and Djokovic. For Serbia, a nation of seven million people, it is “a big deal” to be able to claim the top-ranked player in men’s tennis — and one of the best ever — said Zeljko Prodanovic, the newspaper’s editor.“After the war, it’s not so easy to say, ‘Here we are,’” he said. “You look at the movies, Serbs are always the bad guys. But now we can say we have the best tennis player in the world. That makes us proud.”The newspaper’s owner, Zivana Jovanovic, has welcomed several Serbian luminaries to her office in her two decades at the helm, including the actor Dragan Nikolic and the retired N.B.A. player Vlade Divac. She has never met Djokovic but said she felt as if she knows him because of his high profile. For all his fame, Jovanovic said, Djokovic comes across as humble. “I like that about him,” she said. “He hasn’t let all his success go to his head.”Djokovic’s celebrity status has made it hard for him to move freely in public in Melbourne, but in his younger days he had regular haunts: a church where he would ring in the Orthodox New Year, or the restaurants on Lygon Street, known for its outdoor cafes and European eateries. Now, though, when Djokovic ventures out into the city, as he did before the tournament for a photo opportunity for one of his sponsors, he is swarmed by admirers.Still, Djokovic said he tries to meet and chat with Serbs wherever he goes and invite them to watch him play.“I guess it nurtures the culture and tradition,” he said. “Me as one of the athletes from our country that is internationally successful, I feel there is also a responsibility to represent the country in a right way. For a lot of those people, especially who live here, they have not seen or been to Serbia for a long time. So for them it’s quite a treat to have me playing here and other tennis players from Serbia.”Michael Popovic, a middle-aged Serb who emigrated from Belgrade to Melbourne in his 20s, was at Rod Laver Arena in 2008 when Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the semifinals to reach the final, where he would defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for his first major title. “The feeling I had at that moment was very hard to describe,” said Popovic, a restaurateur. “It was like I just won.”Popovic owns Mediterraneo, a restaurant on a quiet street in an upscale neighborhood south of the city center that specializes in steak and seafood. The restaurant also offers vegan and gluten-free dishes — “Because of Novak,” Popovic said, referring to Djokovic’s decision several years ago to overhaul his diet.“I serve Serbian burgers with no bread crumbs,” Popovic added. “That was Novak’s influence, also.”But the only Djokovic whom Popovic has served is Novak’s uncle Goran. “Somehow I’ve never had the pleasure of having Novak here,” he said.That nearly changed last weekend, when a large party of Serbs — including the pro Janko Tipsarevic, who every year distributes tournament tickets to the local Serbian community through one of his friends — stopped in for dinner. Djokovic was supposed to join them, but long after they had been seated, they received a text from him saying they should eat without him because he was stuck in meetings related to his responsibilities as the president of the ATP Player Council.“It was a pity,” Popovic said. “I was really hoping he would come.”On Monday, Pokrajac, the young fan, made sure he wouldn’t miss Djokovic, arriving at Melbourne Park with his mother, Snezana, more than an hour before the player was scheduled to practice. He wanted to claim a prime viewing spot, up against the fence again. The night before, Pokrajac said, he had imagined getting to hit again with Djokovic, borrowing a technique that has served him well in his matches.“If I visualize something before,” Pokrajac said, “then it will happen.”After Djokovic finished practicing, Pokrajac shouted, “Remember me, Novak? I’m here from Perth.”Djokovic remembered. He came over, hoisted Pokrajac over the fence again, handed him a racket, and they began to hit. They played four “points.” The second rally was 34 shots; the fourth ended on the 16th, when Pokrajac hit a half-volley for a winner.His prize was a hug and a signed T-shirt from Djokovic, who also offered a tip on how to return a slice.“He told me to get lower,” Pokrajac said.Two days later, Pokrajac staked out his same spot. He unfurled a Serbian flag that he had signed and which he intended to present to Djokovic as a parting gift. After his session, Djokovic came over and accepted the flag. He read what Pokrajac had written: “To Novak from Novak from Perth.” Under his signature Pokrajac had written, “It’s going to be worth gold money” and added a smiley face.Djokovic hugged him. As Pokrajac turned to rejoin his mother, his smile was incandescent.“I feel like I know him,” Pokrajac said. “I think we’re going to be friends now.”Ben Rothenberg contributed reporting. "
"Roger Federer Rolls On in His Quest for the Miami Open Title - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Roger Federer will face a hectic few days if he is going to win another Miami Open.He is off to a good start.Federer is through to the quarterfinals, having little trouble on the way to a 6-4, 6-2 victory over 13th-seeded Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday — needing only 61 minutes to prevail while committing a mere eight unforced errors. The match had been pushed back a day because of rain.So now, to win what would be his fourth Miami title, Federer will have to prevail four times in a five-day span. Next up for the No. 4 seed is a quarterfinal Thursday against No. 6 seed Kevin Anderson — a match between the two highest seeds left on the men’s side, and the biggest test yet for Anderson since his return from an elbow issue.“I’m feeling really good,” Federer said. “Today’s match, I can be really happy with so I hope it’s going to give me some confidence for tomorrow.”Federer and Medvedev split the first eight games, and then things turned quickly. Federer broke Medvedev for a 5-4 lead in the first set, fought off three break points to close out the set in the next game, and got another break to open the second set. He cruised home from there.“When you want to go deep in tournaments, sometimes you need those 15 minutes that go your way and you’re able to pull away with the score too,” Federer said of the break and then the rally from 0-40 down to serve out the opening set. “Margins are super-slim and you need a bit of help sometimes from your opponent.”Federer leads the head-to-head against Anderson 5-1, the loss coming last year in the Wimbledon quarterfinals — Anderson winning 13-11 in the fifth set.“If you beat me at Wimbledon, you’ve got my attention,” Federer said.Meanwhile, Simona Halep, the No. 2 seed in the women’s singles draw, also finished her match Wednesday with a flourish.And a return to the world’s No. 1 ranking could be her reward.Halep beat 18th-seeded Qiang Wang 6-4, 7-5 in the quarterfinals. Halep won the final six games against Qiang and would return to No. 1 in the world if she wins her semifinal match against the fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova, who defeated her compatriot from the Czech Republic, the unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, 6-3, 6-4, on Wednesday.“A match against Simona is always intense,” Pliskova said after reaching her third semifinal of 2019.Halep said her coach told her after the quarterfinal victory that she needed just one more win here to claim the top ranking.“It’s pretty much in my head, and I’m happy that I’m in this position again,” she said.Halep has been No. 1 twice before, including most of 2018. She surrendered the ranking to Naomi Osaka in January, and didn’t think she would have a chance to grab it back again this quickly.“It would mean a lot,” Halep said.In a men’s quarterfinal match, the defending champion John Isner defeated Roberto Bautista Agut, 7-6 (1), 7-6 (5). In the semifinals, Isner will play the 18-year-old qualifier Felix Auger-Aliassime, who defeated Borna Coric, 7-6 (3), 6-2, in the quarters."
"Acknowledging Distractions, Novak Djokovic Loses at Miami Open - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — In what is usually one of his most successful stretches of the season, top-ranked Novak Djokovic fell short of expectations for the second time this month, losing, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, to No. 22 Roberto Bautista Agut in the fourth round of the Miami Open on Tuesday afternoon.After gaining a foothold in the match early in the second set, Bautista Agut endured a 40-minute rain delay before drawing level. After breaking for a 3-1 advantage, Bautista Agut dropped his serve but then broke Djokovic again immediately, extending his lead to 5-2 before the two traded holds to finish the match.“The key of the match was at the beginning of the second set, no?” Bautista Agut said. “If I wanted to win the match, I had to be very close at the score. Otherwise Novak, when he gets an advantage, he plays really aggressive.”Indeed, Djokovic had never previously lost a match at the Miami Open after winning the first set, a string of 41 matches.His advantage looked even more secure when he broke Bautista Agut in the first game of the second set, but Djokovic could not hold in the next game.“I lost the momentum,” Djokovic said. “I lost the rhythm in the second set. I gave him a little room to step in, and he did. A little hope that he can come back, and he made a great comeback. But fault is on me, for sure. I had way too many opportunities that I wasted.”Djokovic, a six-time champion in Miami, came into the tournament with little momentum, having lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round at Indian Wells, a tournament where he is a five-time champion.The stumbles have come unexpectedly for Djokovic, who had appeared untouchable as he finished his run to a seventh Australian Open title in January, finishing off the major with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over Rafael Nadal in the final.Djokovic’s inability to dominate has been consistent with the parity on tour this season: The 19 ATP tournaments this season have each been won by a different man. While Djokovic is still a clear leader of the pack in the rankings, his leadership role off the court has perhaps hampered that status.Djokovic, the president of the ATP player council, has spent these tournaments embroiled in a back room imbroglio over the ATP board’s contentious decision not to renew the contract of the chief executive, Chris Kermode.Though Djokovic initially refuted a suggestion that those things had disrupted his play, he ultimately conceded that the distractions had been detrimental.“I just had way too many things off the court,” Djokovic said. “I guess that affected me a little bit on the court.”It was Bautista Agut’s third win over Djokovic in 10 matches. He also defeated him in their most recent meeting in January, in the semifinals of the ATP tournament in Doha, Qatar.Bautista Agut converted 4 of 7 break point opportunities on Tuesday, compared with 4 of 13 for Djokovic.“This kind of match I should not have lost,” Djokovic said. “So many opportunities. Just way too many wasted opportunities.”ISNER ADVANCES; KYRGIOS LOSES The defending champion John Isner reached the Miami Open quarterfinals with a 7-6(5), 7-6(3) win over Britain’s Kyle Edmund on Tuesday, while Nick Kyrgios, in a loss to Brona Coric, was given a point penalty for an audible obscenity.The obscenity by Kyrgios, who produced perhaps the shot of the tournament early in his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 loss to the 11th-seeded Coric, was apparently directed at a spectator. The penalty put him down a double break in the third set.Up next for Coric will be a clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who beat No. 17 Nikoloz Basilashvili, 7-6(4) 6-4, to become the first qualifier to reach the last eight in Miami since Guillermo Canas in 2007. Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, also became the first player born in the 2000s to reach a Masters quarterfinal.Isner, known for his serve, fired 17 aces and won 81 percent of his first-serve points to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set through three matches in Miami. He will next face Bautista Agut. (REUTERS)KVITOVA ATTACKER SENTENCED A man who stabbed the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in her home was sentenced to eight years in prison on Tuesday.Radim Zondra, 33, was convicted of causing Kvitova serious bodily harm by a regional court in Brno, Czech Republic.The state prosecutor requested 12 years for Zondra, who pleaded not guilty to attacking Kvitova in December 2016 in her apartment in Prostejov.Kvitova’s spokesman, Karel Tejkal, said she “respects the ruling of an independent court.”“She’s satisfied with the verdict because she identified the convicted person as the attacker,” Tejkal said.Zondra can appeal, and so can the prosecution.

"Naomi Osaka Splits With Coach After Rising to No. 1 Ranking - The New York Times
Naomi Osaka, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, announced on Monday that she was splitting with her coach, Sascha Bajin, abruptly ending one of the most successful recent partnerships in women’s tennis at what seemed to be a high point.The surprising announcement came just 16 days after Osaka won the Australian Open, her second major title under Bajin’s watch. The win vaulted her to the No. 1 ranking, a first for an Asian player on the men’s or women’s singles tours.Bajin, who became a coach after serving as the longtime hitting partner of Serena Williams, was named the WTA’s Coach of the Year in 2018. He responded on Twitter to Osaka’s announcement.Osaka, 21, was ranked 68th when she hired Bajin in the lead-up to the 2018 season, giving him his first head coaching role. She quickly surged under his guidance, reaching the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time at the 2018 Australian Open, and then winning her first professional singles title at Indian Wells, Calif., in March.Osaka beat Williams, her idol, for the first time in her next match in the first round of the Miami Open, and then memorably beat her again six months later in the final of the U.S. Open, a victory which took her into the top-10 for the first time.The reasons for the split were unclear. Bajin did not respond to messages seeking comment, and Osaka’s agent, Stuart Duguid, declined to comment.Osaka’s split from Bajin is the latest on a coaches’ carousel in which success has not guaranteed longevity in player-coach partnerships. Last year’s French Open champion, Simona Halep, and the Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, parted with their coaches at the end of last season, meaning that the reigning champions of the past four Grand Slam events are no longer with the coaches who helped them to those titles.Halep, ranked third, is now working with Thierry Van Cleemput, who split with his longtime charge David Goffin at the Australian Open.Osaka, who has not yet named a successor to Bajin, will play her first match as WTA No. 1 next week in Dubai. It will be her first time as the No. 1 seed at any WTA event.Asked after the Australian Open final what advice Bajin had given her before the match, Osaka smiled and said she hadn’t talked to him.“Yeah, no, like we haven’t really been talking, to be honest, like before any of my matches here,” Osaka said. “He would tell me, like, one thing, then I would be, like, ‘O.K.’ That was it.”"
"Miami Open: Osaka Stunned; Williams Withdraws; Federer Holds On - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — In a short stretch of Saturday afternoon, the Miami Open lost two of its biggest attractions — and just held on to a third. Top-ranked Naomi Osaka lost her third-round match, 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-3 to 27th-seeded Hsieh Su-wei. Midway through Osaka’s match, Serena Williams, an eight-time tournament champion, unexpectedly withdrew, citing a left knee injury.Osaka, who had emerged as the sport’s best front-runner, had won 63 straight matches when winning the first set, dating to 2016. Osaka also led early in the third set, 2-0, before Hsieh leveled and then took a 4-3 lead she did not let go. Hsieh, a crafty 33-year-old veteran, closed out the victory on her first match point, hitting an overhead smash that Osaka blocked back, and then finishing off the point with an unreturnable slice volley.Osaka had beaten Hsieh earlier this year in the third round of the Australian Open, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1. Hsieh has used her unorthodox game of jabs and feints to establish a reputation as a giant killer; she knocked then-No. 1 Simona Halep out of the third round of Wimbledon last year.”It’s always great to pick up a better level during the match,” Hsieh said in her on-court interview. “Every time you’ve made it and you beat a good player, you feel, ‘Wow, this is everything. This is so amazing, and I’ve made it.’”Osaka, in her typically introspective way, admitted that she had “overestimated” herself in several ways, like thinking she could afford to turn her intensity on and off during matches and judging how well she has been handing the pressure of holding the No. 1 ranking.“I thought I was doing fine with that, but I guess I’m not,” said Osaka, who has a 3-3 record since assuming the top spot, which she may lose depending on the results of other top players in this event. “I think more about winning now.”The 10th-seeded Williams, who last won the Miami Open in 2015, was to face 18th-seeded Wang Qiang in a third-round match Sunday. Wang receives a walkover into the fourth round, where she will await the winner between Wang Yafan and 25th-seeded Danielle Collins.It was the third consecutive tournament in which Williams’s body let her down before her racket did. Williams, 37, was forced to retire midway through her second match in Indian Wells, Calif., earlier this month because of a viral illness. In the Australian Open quarterfinals in January, Williams was leading Karolina Pliskova, 5-1, in the third set when she twisted her ankle on match point. Though she had more match point opportunities, the injury particularly encumbered Williams’s serve, causing her to lose all 10 subsequent points in her service games.After receiving a bye in the first round of the Miami Open, Williams survived an up-and-down second-round match against 63rd-ranked Rebecca Peterson on Friday afternoon. She had not appeared encumbered by her knee, though she did struggle with blinding glare that shone on her side of the court for part of the match, through gaps at Hard Rock Stadium which is hosting tennis for the first time. Williams survived with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 victory but was not happy with her performance.“I need to just move on and really focus on playing better — or not be in the tournament much longer,” Williams said in her postmatch news conference.Osaka will next play at the WTA tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, in April, but where Williams will play next is unclear. The next mandatory WTA event for top players is the Madrid Open in May, though Williams has not played there since 2015. Williams did not play any clay court tournaments before the French Open last year, as she focused on improving her conditioning and losing weight she had gained during and after her pregnancy.That sort of selectivity in scheduling, long a staple of Williams’s career, has increased in recent years, when she has focused more and more on Grand Slam events.In the men’s draw, Roger Federer avoided being a third high-profile casualty at the tournament on Saturday when he rallied to beat Radu Albot of Moldova, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. Federer, 37, acknowledged some fuzziness on his tactics against Albot, who won the nearby Delray Beach ATP tournament last month.“He seemed very clear to me, and I wasn’t,” Federer said. “In the heat of the moment, I started forgetting stuff also that my coach told me.”"
"Rafael Nadal Holds Off One Young Challenger, and Prepares to Meet Another - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Early in his quarterfinal match at the Australian Open on Tuesday, Frances Tiafoe, part of a new generation of male stars who have emerged for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament, faced a break point against his battle-tested opponent.But Rafael Nadal, of course, is not just any opponent. He is the No. 2 seed, a champion in Melbourne in 2009, the owner of 17 Grand Slam titles and as punishing a player as ever at age 32.Nadal’s return of serve came back powerfully, pushing the 21-year-old Tiafoe far to his backhand side for a meager reply. And with that, Nadal, as he did during the entire span of a vintage and coldly efficient victory, had put his opponent on an energy-sapping, confidence-draining string.The exchange ended, mercifully, with a booming Nadal down-the-line forehand, which the powerfully built Tiafoe sent meekly into the net.Two games into a much-anticipated fight, Tiafoe’s serve had been broken, his fighting spirit dealt a severe blow.After winning that first break point, Nadal never looked back. Roughly 90 minutes later, the scoreboard flashed the result: 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.Earlier, another rising star had done what Tiafoe could not, beating his elder to reach the semifinals. Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old from Greece, defeated the 30-year-old Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2), several hours before Nadal and Tiafoe took the court.But with Nadal’s win at Rod Laver Arena, a measure of order was restored by a member of the old guard.Buoyant on court after the match, Nadal told the crowd that he had recently joked that the tour’s young challengers could wait awhile before challenging for tennis supremacy.“But looks that they don’t want to wait,” he said. “They are there, no?”In this tournament, Nadal has also beaten Alex de Minaur, the 19-year-old new hope of Australia. In the semifinals on Thursday, he will play Tsitsipas.Tsitsipas, seeded 14th and the first Greek player to make a serious dent in the pro game, is among the clutch of college-age players heralded by the ATP Tour as eventual successors to the four aging kings of the sport: Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray, who have won virtually every Grand Slam singles title since 2003.They will not be able to defy time forever. Case in point: Murray, the three-time major champion, a former No. 1 and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, announced at the start of this tournament that his days as a player may end at this year’s Wimbledon, if not sooner.“It feels like a fairytale,” Tsitsipas said in a post-match interview.As he spoke, inside the stadium and out, rowdy fans, many from Melbourne’s large Greek population, chanted songs and danced — as they have all tournament long.With his flowing locks and scythe-like, one-handed backhand, Tsitsipas had proved himself a legitimate threat to win here when he blunted Federer on center stage Sunday night.The upset “got people’s attention,” he said. “My biggest challenge was to stay concentrated, stay focused” in order to prove the win over Federer was no fluke.Tiafoe — known as “Big Foe,” and one of the few black players on tour — could not come close to duplicating Tsitsipas’s effort. Before playing Nadal, the young American seemed to be playing with the form and confidence that would give him a chance for a monumental upset of his own. He had scored three straight surprising wins against higher-ranked players, including one over the No. 5 seed, Kevin Anderson. He had also gained an avid following with his vivacious on-court persona and post-match celebrations — taking off his shirt and pounding his chest, mimicking his favorite N.B.A. players.His hope against Nadal was that his young legs would push him past a champion who has won 80 tour titles in a career of nearly two decades.Add to that: Maybe, just maybe, Nadal would break down on the unforgiving hard court, a surface that has taken a toll on his body.After all, Nadal completed just one hard court event last year. At the Australian Open, he retired during the fifth set of his quarterfinal against Marin Cilic, because of an upper leg injury. At the United States Open in September, he retired again, this time because of a knee injury during a semifinal against Juan Martín del Potro.Nadal took the rest of the year off and had ankle surgery. Then, after he arrived in Australia, he withdrew from a warm-up event in Brisbane because of a left thigh injury.But at Melbourne Park this year, he looks refreshed. His movement is fluid. His ball striking has looked as crisp and powerful as ever.Tiafoe spoke to this, offering a view of what it’s like from the distressed other side of the court.“I knew he was going to bring crazy intensity,” Tiafoe said. “I knew the ball was going to be jumping.“I knew if he got hold of a forehand, it was going to be barbecue chicken,” he continued, resorting to a culinary metaphor to describe how he felt after just a few points: cooked.Keenly aware of how small the margins between winning and losing are at this level, Nadal slightly altered his service motion during the off-season. He cut down on his backswing to gain more efficient power. He said after Tuesday’s match that he had also worked on finishing points earlier than usual, to reduce the wear on his body.There is still much tennis to be played in this tournament. Novak Djokovic, the firmly entrenched No. 1 player, remains on the other side of the draw. He and Nadal could meet in the final here for the second time, a rematch of 2012, when Djokovic won in a nearly six-hour marathon.But first things first, and for Nadal that means facing Tsitsipas, another chance for the old guard to keep a youthful challenger at bay."
"It’s No. 1 vs. the One and Only as Halep Gets Set to Play Serena Williams - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Top-ranked Simona Halep expressed relief and satisfaction after her third-round victory over Venus Williams on Saturday night at the Australian Open. She also remained galvanized for the task ahead — a fourth-round match on Monday against Venus’s sister, Serena.“It’s always a big challenge to play against the Williams sisters,” Halep said in her on-court interview after her 6-2, 6-3 victory over Venus. “So I was super-motivated today.” As she will have to be on Monday.“Definitely is the toughest draw I’ve ever had,” Halep said.Though Halep arrived at Melbourne without a victory since August, she has impressed in her first three matches here. “I think she played pretty flawless today,” was the assessment from Venus Williams after the match.Serena Williams, meanwhile, easily won her third-round match — 6-2, 6-1 over Dayana Yastremska — and then expressed eagerness for the chance to test herself against the No. 1-ranked Halep.“I honestly would love to face the world No. 1,” said Williams, adding that she hasn’t faced a No. 1 since her return from maternity leave last year. Actually, Williams has actually not faced a No. 1 player in nearly six years — largely because you can’t be across the net from the No. 1 when you are the No. 1.Williams’s last match against a top-ranked player was against Victoria Azarenka in February 2013 in the Doha final. Though Williams lost that match, she secured the No. 1 ranking by reaching the semifinals of that tournament and she then held onto it for 186 weeks, through the 2016 U.S. Open, when she ceded it to Angelique Kerber.Despite her two runs to Grand Slam finals last year, Williams has not beaten many high-profile opponents since her return. She is 1-3 against top-10 players in that span, with the lone victory coming last year against Karolina Pliskova in the United States Open quarterfinals.Still, Williams is considered the player to beat at every tournament she enters. And according to the player who has spent the last 48 weeks atop the rankings, she’s still the best in the world.“In my opinion, to be No. 1 in the world and to be the best player in the world, it’s a little bit different,” Halep said. “In this moment, I’m No. 1 in the world, so I will take that. I have been there many months, many weeks.“But for sure she’s the best player in the world because she won so many Grand Slams,” Halep added in reference to Williams, who is a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. “She’s been a lot on No. 1. I cannot compare my results to her. But in this moment, I am confident that I am in this position, and I’m positive about it.”Monday’s blockbuster match is a product of a draw that has been almost devoid of major upsets, with seven of the top eight women reaching the fourth round (No. 3 Caroline Wozniacki lost to five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova in the third round).That steadiness by the favorites represents an abrupt arrival of order to women’s Grand Slam tennis: at Wimbledon last year, only one of the top eight reached the fourth round; at the United States Open, only three did.Pliskova, the only player seeded in the top 8 to make the second week at the last three Grand Slams, could face the winner of the Halep-Williams match in the quarterfinals. She is looking forward to which of the two it might be.“For sure, the best match now in the draw,” Pliskova said.The men have also had a steady ride to the round of 16, with six of the top eight seeded players reaching the second week, including the top four.But those four all have tough challenges directly ahead of them. The top-seeded player, Novak Djokovic, faces No. 15 Daniil Medvedev, whose ranking has soared from No. 65 since the beginning of last season. Rafael Nadal, who is seeded No. 2, faces resurgent veteran Tomas Berdych, who beat him in straight sets here in 2015, which was their most recent meeting on hard courts.Roger Federer, seeded No. 3, faces No. 14 Stefanos Tsitsipas, the young Greek who won the ATP’s Next Gen competition in Milan in November. And the player seeded No. 4, Alexander Zverev, faces No. 16 Milos Raonic, who has already knocked out Nick Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka en route to the second week.Though all dangerous, none of those men face a challenge quite like the one that Serena Williams presents to Halep. Halep is 1-8 against Williams, with her lone win coming via a 6-0, 6-2 blitz in the round-robin stage of the 2014 WTA championships in Singapore. Williams avenged that loss, 6-3, 6-0, in the final days later.Halep said she would be used to the pressure of facing Williams when they meet here on Monday and hoped she would able to play the same sort of assertive, proactive tennis she deployed against Venus.“I’m in a good position,” she said. “I feel confident. I played very well today. But doesn’t mean it’s going to be the same against her. I will wait. I will focus on myself — it’s the most important thing.”And Halep, who has kept a markedly positive attitude throughout the tournament, said there would be something positive resulting from the match, regardless of the outcome. “It’s always great to play against Serena,” she said. “Because every time, I have something to learn.”"
"Taylor Fritz Loses, but Learns, Against Roger Federer - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — This is a story about Roger Federer’s third-round match. Only it is not about Roger Federer.It is about a young upstart on the men’s tennis tour, a lanky power-hitting Californian who possesses skill and promise and a résumé stacked with solid but not spectacular results.At Rod Laver Arena this Friday afternoon, the education of Taylor Fritz took a significant, though bruising, step forward. This was a graduate level course held in front of 15,000 fans, taught with calculating precision by a 37-year-old Swiss who has won 20 Grand Slam titles.“Yes, a real lesson,” Fritz said, once the match was done. “I’m going to be better because of this match, I’ll tell you that.”Fritz, who is 21 and considered to be one of the most promising players in the game, had come to this Australian Open match on the heels of the biggest Grand Slam victory of his career: a tense, hard-fought win over the 30th-seeded Frenchman Gaël Monfils.After that match, though he was playing as confidently as he ever had, Fritz was cleareyed about his slim chances against an all-time great like Federer. He noted how his only previous meeting with Federer had been a battle that went to the later stage of a tight third set. Then Fritz had crumbled.This time, though aware of the long odds against him, Fritz vowed to play loose and relaxed. “Have fun,” he said. “Play my game, hit big.” He wanted to soak up the moment, and learn.At 1 p.m. on a muggy afternoon, Fritz finally took the court at Rod Laver Arena. He had never played there. He smiled tightly. He fidgeted with his brown hair and white headband. His mind raced.“There were a lot of thoughts going on in my head,” he would explain, noting that he had simultaneously tried to pump himself up and find calm by listening to rap on his headphones as he strode before the fans.Then the warm-up began. It was impossible to miss the fact that Fritz’s introduction took just a few seconds. When Federer’s followed, crackling over the public address system, it was a condensed version of the Swiss star’s achievements. Even shortened, it took a full minute.Now the match was on, and it was clear from the beginning that Federer considered Fritz dangerous. He had reason to. In that one and only meeting, in Stuttgart, Germany, in the summer of 2016, Federer had emerged victorious, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Hardly smooth sailing. Federer seemed determined not to let Fritz get that close again.So, from the start, Federer displayed the fullness of his range. There were sharp angles and booming drives. There were heavily spinning forehands followed by balls that cut flat against the hot air. It was a level of play Federer will need if he is to win this tournament for a third straight time, and a seventh over all.“It’s been a long time since I have gotten a beat-down like that,” Fritz told me, unspooling the entire experience once it was done. “It didn’t feel great, not at all.”The first set took 20 minutes. Federer: 6-1.In the second set, Fritz fared better. He began using the leverage from his 6-foot-4-inch frame. With Federer serving, Fritz nudged ahead in a key game. Federer responded with a pair of scorching forehand winners and a curveball ace.“I get any of those points and I have a break point, a chance to break him and a chance to serve for the set,” Fritz said.There was resignation in his eyes. But also a glint of hope. “Look, with someone as good as Roger, you know that might be the only chance you get,” Fritz said. “I can see now that you have to take it.”He certainly did soak up the moment. He loved every part of playing in front of a crowd that large. He tried a bit of showmanship, on one point faking as if he was going down the line, then hitting crosscourt. Problem was, Federer caught up to the ball, responded with a fake of his own and hit a winner.Fritz had been posterized.“I tried to play with him,” he said, “and, well, he played me back.”Then he spoke of his last stand. Of trying to simply survive. “Regroup, hold serve, hold serve,” he said he kept telling himself, like a mantra.It didn’t work. Everyone could feel it, most notably his opponent. “Federer was rolling,” Fritz said. “I’ve seen it so many times before, on TV. Once he is in front, he smothers you.”The end was inevitable. The final score: 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.Next up for Federer is the round of 16, and another dangerous young player: Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old from Greece, part of a group of 23-and-under men making waves in Melbourne. The American Frances Tiafoe, who turns 21 on Sunday, is in the fourth round of a major for the first time after following his upset of fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson with a five-set win over Andreas Seppi on Friday.Taylor Fritz, meantime, will return to California, itching for more center courts, more Grand Slam tournaments, more matches against the very best. Against Federer, he experienced aspects of tennis that, if copied, will add significantly to his growth. How to disrupt timing. When to use angles. The way pouncing on the slimmest openings can change tone.“This was such a learning experience for me,” he said. “I plan to take it and get better, get more comfortable in these moments, so I can play the way I know I can play. I plan to use this as a steppingstone.”"
"Teenagers Provide Glimpse of Future at Miami Open - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Experience triumphed over youth in the Miami Open semi-finals where a pair of veterans held off talented Canadian teenagers whose time to shine will have to wait. Denis Shapovalov, 19, and 18-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime saw their exuberant runs in the tournament halted by their older counterparts but not before showcasing their talent that bodes well for the future.For Shapovalov, his matchup with 20-times Grand Slam singles champion Federer was something he had long dreamed of.""It's surreal, being on the court against him,"" Shapovalov told reporters after losing in straight sets. ""Obviously I wasn't trying to focus on the fact that it's Roger on the other side. I was just trying to play as good as I can, and he did a good job today. I'm just going to try to learn from this and move forward.""Shapovalov had practised with a Federer, 37, on a couple of occasions, but stepping into a competitive arena against him was a learning experience and one that could serve him well.Shapovalov, who defeated Rafa Nadal nearly two years ago in Montreal, said he could see a change of guard coming in tennis.""Yeah, there is definitely a lot of talent coming in,"" Shapovalov told the Daily Express. ""It's just that point in the ATP, you know, you still have kind of the legends, you know, Rog, Rafa, still there on top, but you have a lot of newcomers with talent kind of gunning for them.""Auger-Aliassime could be one of those newcomers after becoming the youngest men's semi-finalist in the Miami Open's 35-year history. The young standout had chances to serve out for wins in both sets of his 7-6(3) 7-6(4) defeat to American 33-year-old John Isner but was ultimately undone by costly double faults.""The biggest lesson was to stay in the present and believe in yourself, because you can always dig deep and find resources within yourself,"" Auger-Aliassime said of his run.""So I think that's a huge lesson to not give up, stay calm, and just work every day.""""His (Shapovalov) results and mine are pushing each other. I think, yeah, a lot of belief, a lot of positive things happening, and I think it's just pushing us."" (Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"
"Can Aryna Sabalenka Ride Her Hot Streak to the Australian Open Title? - The New York Times
After spending 2018 rapidly ascending the global tennis ranks, Aryna Sabalenka decided to spend some of her brief off-season in free fall. So during a winter visit to Dubai, Sabalenka said, she took the opportunity to bungee jump from 41 floors up.“These three seconds before you jump, it’s like something unbelievable,” Sabalenka, a 20-year-old Belarusian, said in a recent telephone interview. “You want to cry, smile and laugh.”The daring off-season activity underscored the intensity and cheerfulness that came to define Sabalenka as she burst onto the scene last year, winning her first two WTA titles.“She’s always very friendly,” said her coach, Dmitry Tursunov. “She likes to be in a good mood.”She also likes to win, and she has started where she left off after her breakthrough campaign, becoming the first WTA titlist of 2019 by defeating Alison Riske, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, in the final of the tournament in Shenzhen, China, on Saturday.Now Sabalenka can add one more label: dark horse to win the Australian Open, where she could establish herself not just as an up-and-comer but as one of the sport’s pacesetters.“I’m telling you here, right now, that the winner of the Australian Open women’s side is going to be Sabalenka, O.K.?” the ESPN analyst Patrick McEnroe told reporters this week. “She’s going to win the Australian Open.”The title in Shenzhen helped her return to a career-best ranking of No. 11 on the eve of the year’s first Grand Slam tournament. And despite a stumble at her next tournament — a first-round loss to eighth-ranked Petra Kvitova in Sydney — Sabalenka’s recent tear has put her on more than one list of Australian Open favorites.“If you look at the top 20 players, especially with her age, she is probably the most dangerous one right now because of the power,” said Sophie Amiach, a former Australian Open quarterfinalist in singles and doubles who is now an analyst for the WTA’s world feed.“Besides the given, Serena, everybody else, the power is there, but I don’t think it’s as much as what she has,” Amiach added, referring to Serena Williams, who is seeking to equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.But the overwhelming force that has fueled Sabalenka’s rise can also be difficult to harness at times. Her serves and forehands can misfire by yards, and her shot selection is sometimes questionable. Seesaw matches proved a mainstay for Sabalenka in 2018, leading to a WTA-high 29 third sets contested.That inconsistency might have been what prompted a bit of criticism from President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus when he met Sabalenka in November.“I am happy with your performance,” he was quoted saying by the news agency BeITA, “except for several moments when the ball went out of court while you could keep it in the game.”But like her fellow rising star Naomi Osaka, 21, Sabalenka has started to rein in her game while still blasting winners. It helped Sabalenka, the only player to take a set off Osaka during her run to the United States Open title last fall, rise to No. 13 by the end of 2018 after beginning the year ranked 73rd. Her eight wins over top-10 players last year — all after June — placed her behind only Kiki Bertens and Elina Svitolina.And Sabalenka toppled Svitolina, the eventual champion at the WTA Finals in October, on the way to her biggest title, in Wuhan, China, a month earlier.“She is a quick learner, but I feel also she is a quick learner because she is passionate about it and wants to do it,” said Tursunov, who used a similarly powerful style to win seven ATP titles in his career. “And I think that kind of summarizes her improvement.”Before he became Sabalenka’s coach during the summer grass-court swing last year, Tursunov had already been impressed by his future charge’s performance and attitude as he observed her on tour.At last year’s tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., Tursunov looked on as the player he was then coaching, Elena Vesnina, faced Sabalenka and her countrywoman Victoria Azarenka in a doubles match with Ekaterina Makarova. Vesnina and Makarova, the tournament’s top seeds, prevailed, 6-4, 6-3.“She didn’t get fazed when she was being rifled at,” Tursunov said, “and a few times they were just going at her and knocked her down on her butt. She was kind of sitting and giggling.”He added: “Those are the things that just kind of stuck in my mind. The way she was handling tough situations, and situations where she was being outplayed.”Sabalenka attributes some of that mental toughness to her roots in Belarus. Money was scarce, so she did not compete in any junior Grand Slam events and participated in just four tournaments outside Europe.“I could play tennis, but no one believed in me that much,” Sabalenka said. “Actually I think this kind of thing helped me to improve my game.“Before, I was actually upset with it. They think I am not the best player, and it made me work extra hard and improve my game.”It was with the Belarusian Fed Cup team, however, that Sabalenka emerged on the broader scene, in 2017. Belarus advanced to the final, with Sabalenka and Aliaksandra Sasnovich falling to the Americans Shelby Rogers and CoCo Vandeweghe in the deciding doubles match in Minsk.Even as her ranking climbs and her goals become loftier, Sabalenka said she did not intend to skip the Fed Cup series. Her energy seems to resonate throughout the squad.“She is always fighting, so when playing on a team with her, you just cannot go down, because you are just getting involved in this flow she creates,” Vera Lapko, her fellow 20-year-old Belarusian, said in an email.Neither that grit nor the smiles will escape Sabalenka anytime soon.“I’m smiling and laughing,” she said. “I don’t want to be too serious because this is not me.”"
"Federer to Face Isner in Miami Final - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Roger Federer cruised into his fifth Miami Open final with an impressive 6-2 6-4 victory against Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov on Friday.Federer was dominant in service and broke the 19-year-old three times to set up a final with American John Isner, who beat 18-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(3) 7-6(4).Federer took control of his semi-final early, breaking Shapovalov in the third game as his young opponent shanked a backhand.Federer broke again in the third game of the second set and served his way into the final against defending champion Isner, who is yet to drop a set in the tournament this year.Isner, however, had to battle back in both sets against the 18-year-old Canadian, who led 5-3 in each set but was unable to seal the win.""For sure (it was) nerves,"" said Auger-Aliassime, the youngest men's semi-finalist in the tournament's 35-year history. ""It's like I caught a virus or something. I don't know. I couldn't put a second serve anymore. ""Even the first serve, if you put it in, you don't have to hit the second serve. That's just very tough to swallow.""Auger-Aliassime had appeared unbothered by being on the big stage against the crowd favourite playing attacking, aggressive tennis that rewarded him with the early break in each set.Yet serving for the set, the 18-year-old's inexperience and nerves were exposed when he produced three of his seven double faults and opened the door for the 33-year-old American who went on to take the first tiebreak 7-3.Auger-Aliassime regrouped and was on the attack again in the second, grabbing the early break to nose in front 4-2.Again serving for the set at 5-3, he let Isner back in the contest as the American got back on serve with the help of yet another Auger-Aliassime double fault.While Auger-Aliassime was misfiring, Isner's serve was booming, as he blasted 21 aces past his opponent.""I think it (experience) may have helped a little bit,"" said Isner.""But you see a lot of times where someone can have all the experience in the world or some teams can have all the experience in the world and they don't come through against an inexperienced opponent.""Maybe he was a little bit fatigued because he came through qualifying. So could have been a little bit of inexperience and maybe a little bit of fatigue, also.""

"Serena Williams Falls to Karolina Pliskova With Late Collapse - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams was one point from the Australian Open semifinals when she lost her footing and the match slipped away.Williams, who was seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, lost the final six games to fall, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, to Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday, relinquishing her lead after rolling her left ankle when the match was within her reach.“I was almost in the locker room, but now I’m standing here as a winner,” Pliskova said in her on-court interview after the match. “So it’s a really good feeling.”Williams, known more for improbable comebacks than collapses, had not lost a Grand Slam match after holding a match point since the 2010 French Open.Pliskova, the No. 7 seed, will face the fourth-seeded Naomi Osaka in the semifinals on Thursday. The other semifinal pits the eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova against the unseeded American Danielle Collins.This was Williams’s fourth major tournament since resuming her career in 2018 after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September 2017. Williams withdrew before the fourth round of last year’s French Open because of an injury and lost in two other Grand Slam finals — to Anqelique Kerber at Wimbledon and to Osaka at the United States Open in a match remembered primarily for Williams’s confrontation with the chair umpire, which cost her a game penalty.Williams, who dispatched the top-seeded Simona Halep in a hard-fought, fourth-round match, has not defeated two top-10 players at the same event since returning from her pregnancy. She has spoken candidly about her struggles to return to peak physical condition after giving birth, and she arrived here looking fitter than she had since before her pregnancy.Williams, 37, has not reached for excuses, even when she has struggled in ways she had not before leaving the tour to become a mother.“From Day 1, I expect to go out and, quite frankly, to win,” Williams said. “That hasn’t happened. But I do like my attitude. I like that I don’t want to go out here and say, ‘I expect to lose because I had a year off, I’ve been playing for 10 months, I’m not supposed to win.’ I don’t have that attitude.”While Williams’s mind-set has been positive, on Wednesday her body betrayed her and the match suddenly pivoted in Pliskova’s favor.Her match turned in an instant. With a commanding 5-1 lead in the third set, the 16th-seeded Williams held a match point on her serve, at 40-30. But after she was called for a foot fault on her first serve, Williams appeared to sustain an injury in the rally that began off her second serve, rolling her left ankle as she tried to change directions to reach a shot from Pliskova.Williams lost the point, and then the next two points. She did not call a medical timeout on the ensuing changeover, but she retied her shoelaces, making them tighter.“I really hate calling the trainer out, to be honest,” she said. “And at that point I didn’t feel like I needed it or I didn’t feel like it would be a big deal. So I just kept going.”But the tighter shoes did not keep her in the match. Pliskova won the next two games, pulling to 4-5, suddenly back on serve. Williams earned three more match points in the 10th game, but Pliskova saved them all.“I thought, ‘All right, here we go, you’re going to win one of these,’” Williams said. “That clearly didn’t happen, but I was just trying at that point.”Pliskova held on to make it 5-5 with a backhand cross-court winner, punctuated with a loud and long scream.“Then, suddenly, I got a chance too,” Pliskova said of her improbable victory after facing four match points. “That’s how it is in tennis. You need luck, of course, because this is — I think — not happening often. Maybe once in life. But I went for it.”Williams, who like all right-handers lands on her left foot when she serves, lost all 10 remaining points on her serve after the injury. While she said she would not know how bad her ankle injury was until a day later, she played down the effect of the injury on the outcome of the match, repeatedly giving Pliskova credit for playing “lights out” tennis as she surged back.“I think she just played well on my serve after that point,” Williams said. “I think she just kind of started playing really, really good. I don’t think it had anything to do with my ankle, per se. I just think she was just nailing and hitting shots. Obviously I made some mistakes, but she played really well after that.”Pliskova said she thought something might have happened to Williams, but that she remained focused on her own side of the court.“Whatever is happening on the other side, I just try to block it,” Pliskova said. “Either it’s positive or negative, whatever is there, it’s just not my business. I’m sorry, but that’s how it is. I know once I’m starting to think about that, it’s bad.”Pliskova won the next two games to complete the improbable comeback, winning after Williams hit a forehand into the net for an unforced error on her third match point.Pliskova, a former No. 1, had knocked Williams out of a Grand Slam event before, beating her in straight sets in the 2016 United States Open semifinals. She had looked on track for a similarly efficient victory when she broke Williams for a 3-2 lead in the second set.But Williams roared back, breaking Pliskova at love in the next game, beginning a stretch of winning 9 of 11 games and taking complete command of the match before her late collapse.Pliskova, whose appearance in the 2016 United States Open final was her only previous major title match, has won two of her previous three matches against Osaka. She most recently beat her 6-4, 6-4 in the final of the WTA tournament in Tokyo in September.Osaka, 21, will be seeking a second straight Grand Slam title. She reached the semifinals with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over the sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina.Osaka, who had never reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam before her triumph in New York last fall, said she was keeping this accomplishment in perspective.“To be here is something that a lot of people want, and I know that a few months ago I would have given anything to be in the semifinals of a slam,” Osaka said. “But it’s this weird feeling of: You want to do the next big thing. And especially now that I won a Grand Slam, and I feel like I want to win another one, and I’m so close and I just want to keep going.”Osaka and Kvitova could each claim the No. 1 ranking for the first time if they win the tournament on Saturday. After pulling herself from the brink of defeat, Pliskova also has a chance to return to the No. 1 ranking with a victory, even if she had begun to count herself out of the tournament when she was one point from defeat.“My mind was in the locker room,” Pliskova said. “I was still here.”For Williams, who has the trophy as her goal every time she arrives at a Grand Slam event, her quest to match Margaret Court’s 24 singles Grand Slam titles will resume at the French Open in May.”I mean, the big picture for me is always winning,” Williams said. “I’m not going to sit here and lie about that. It hasn’t happened yet, but I feel like it’s going to happen. Just keep taking it one match at a time, just keep soldiering on, I guess.”"

"Reilly Opelka Continues Rise With First ATP Title at New York Open - The New York Times
UNIONDALE, N.Y. — The second edition of the New York Open concluded on Sunday with a pair of unexpected players engaging in a tense and memorable final that provided enough excitement to make up for the lack of star power.The organizers of the event, which moved to Long Island last year after 40 years in Memphis, might have hoped for more marketable names to highlight the tournament’s final days to help lift the profile of the tour stop.After all, neither Reilly Opelka nor Brayden Schnur were among the seven players featured on the promotional posters used to advertise the tournament’s return to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. But Opelka and Schnur provided plenty of buzz for the 3,128 fans who showed up for the final.The tension peaked with a nerve-racking replay after a challenge on the 15th point of the third-set tiebreaker. On the next point, Opelka finished off Schnur, 6-1, 6-7 (7), 7-6 (7), for his first ATP Tour-level title.Opelka, 21, has won challenger tournaments at the lower levels of the professional tour, and he won the juniors title at Wimbledon in 2015. But this was the breakthrough he and many of his supporters had anticipated for some time.“This is definitely my biggest title yet, the one I’m most proud of, for sure,” Opelka said. “It’s been a lot of years coming.”It did not come easy. Schnur saved five match points and appeared to have a match point of his own when he served what seemed to be an ace at 7-7 in the tiebreaker of the decisive set. But Opelka challenged the call, and the serve was ruled out by perhaps a millimeter.Schnur, who had never even won an ATP Tour-level match before arriving in New York (he was 0 for 5), then missed his second serve for a double fault. At 8-7, Opelka ripped an ace out wide to win the match.“That challenge was probably the difference in the match,” Opelka said.At 6 feet 11 inches with a booming serve, Opelka is expected to rise to No. 56 from No. 89 when the new rankings come out. Sunday’s result will also bolster his status as a potential heir to John Isner, the current top-ranked American male player, whom Opelka has beaten twice in a row.Opelka downed the top-seeded Isner in their hard-hitting semifinal encounter Saturday night as the two set a record with 81 combined aces in a three-set match. That was a repeat of Opelka’s surprise victory over the 6-10 Isner in the first round of the Australian Open last month.Opelka’s close victory on the black wooden courts at the Coliseum denied Schnur, a 23-year-old from Canada, what would have been an even more improbable victory.A qualifier with a head cold, Schnur arrived in New York last week without a guaranteed spot in the draw.He had reached a career-high ranking of 154th leading up to the New York Open, but he nearly didn’t get to play a single point here. He was granted the last alternate spot in the qualifying draw, and he won two matches there to advance to the main draw. There he upset the third-seeded Steve Johnson and the sixth-seeded Sam Querrey as he earned four straight victories to reach the final.Though generally unknown, Schnur, a former college player at the University of North Carolina who was born in Pickering, Ontario, has one attribute that will endear him to those who want pro tennis to speed up: He does not bounce the ball before serving. Most players bounce it at least a few times, and some, like Rafael Nadal, sometimes bounce it repeatedly, to the chagrin of some opponents and spectators.Schnur stands at the baseline, waits for his opponent to get into the ready position, and then simply tosses the ball into the air and slams away. He started doing it that way, he said, while playing on the uneven grass at warm-up tournaments ahead of Wimbledon. Schnur said the unpredictable bounces left him scrambling to catch up to the ball and adversely affected his rhythm.The emotions of the breakthrough week seemed to catch up to Schnur on Sunday as he fought back tears in his postmatch speech to fans and later during his news conference.“Only a handful of people know how hard I really worked for this,” he said. “I’m not the most talented guy out on the court.”Schnur’s and Opelka’s paths to the final were relatively smooth, as the Open’s field of players didn’t include many of the world’s top-ranked individuals. But attendance was up compared with last year, according to Josh Ripple, the tournament director, both over all and for the final; in last year’s final, Kevin Anderson beat Querrey.“We did better by every metric,” Ripple said, “including attendance and revenue, and 2020 will be the pivotal year for us.”If Opelka comes back, he probably will make it onto the poster."
"For Caroline Wozniacki, Battling Arthritis Is the New Normal - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — The beginning of a calendar year normally would seem a strange time to be preoccupied with endings. But when Andy Murray tearfully announced his impending retirement because of a deteriorating right hip in a pretournament news conference, the Australian Open underwent a jarring mood swing, from the so-called Happy Slam to a major dominated by talk about pain management and the sometimes extraordinary measures required to prolong careers.The Hospice Slam, anyone?The 31-year-old Murray, a three-time major winner, missed the tournament last year because of hip surgery that did not alleviate his suffering. On Monday, he valiantly battled the pain and his opponent, Roberto Bautista Agut, for more than four hours before losing in five sets.Rafael Nadal, 32, who secured a spot in the second round against Matthew Ebden, described how his crumbling knees and various other injuries have forced him to adjust his practice schedule based on his “body feelings” and to adopt a faster, more aggressive serve to try to shorten points.The five-time major winner Maria Sharapova, 31, easily dispatched Harriet Dart, then spoke about how the shoulder pain that has plagued her for 10 years forced her to accept the fact that “you’re not immortal; you’re never going to play this forever.”Then there was Caroline Wozniacki, who is still in her twenties but already managing her own health crisis. Wozniacki, 28, returned to Rod Laver Arena for her first-round match against Alison Van Uytvanck looking outwardly the same as she did when she outlasted Simona Halep on the same stage last year to win her first Grand Slam title.Wozniacki ran down drop shots and prevailed in most of the rallies of more than nine shots in a 6-3, 6-4 victory that belied the extra effort now required for her to maintain her competitive edge. Last summer Wozniacki learned she had rheumatoid arthritis, a condition linked to immune system dysfunction. As Wozniacki explained it, her immune system attacks healthy tissue in and around the joints of her hands, knees and feet, causing rashes, inflammation and fatigue.The diagnosis forced Wozniacki to overhaul her routine to include more massages, less (or at least smarter) tennis, more rest, less sugar, more stretching and less jogging.“You listen to the body, you try different things,” she said, adding: “There are days I wake up and don’t feel great, and when that happens, I’m still going to go out there and do my thing, but I’m going to taper it down. And I know in my head I don’t need to go full-out today and it’s going to make me feel worse tomorrow. I’ve matured a lot. That’s never how I used to think.”It’s remarkable to hear so many prominent players give voice to their vulnerabilities. As Murray acknowledged, “When you’re going to compete, you want to be positive and optimistic about things because you don’t want to be telling your opponents, the guys you’re competing against, how bad you’re feeling.”His Friday news conference announcing his retirement, he added, “was kind of the first time I kind of came out and let everyone know how bad it’s been and tough.”Wozniacki was the same way. She knew before last year’s United States Open that the flulike symptoms that had plagued her all summer were, in fact, signs of something more serious. But she said nothing about her condition for two months, waiting until the news conference after her final match of the season, in Singapore in October, to reveal the diagnosis.“I didn’t want to give anyone the edge,” Wozniacki said.She rejected the notion that a full disclosure of her health woes would have benefited her by moderating external expectations.“I think because I’m such a competitor, I don’t want anything to be an excuse,” Wozniacki said, adding: “I know myself and what I’ve done out there. I’m either proud of myself for giving it my all, or I can be disappointed because I thought I could do better, but I don’t really need the sympathy.”Wozniacki followed her Australian Open title with two more victories, in a pre-Wimbledon tuneup at Eastbourne in June and a Premier Mandatory event in Beijing in October — both, she said, while exhibiting one or more of the textbook symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The Beijing win was especially satisfying, Wozniacki said, “because I didn’t know, will I ever be able to play six matches in a row? That really gave me the confidence, you know, if I can do this I can do anything.”After Wimbledon, where Wozniacki lost in the second round, the rest of her summer passed in a fog of inconclusive doctor visits and inexplicable early-round losses. Wozniacki withdrew from the tournament in Washington because of pain in her knees. In her next tournament, in Montreal, she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in her first match and awoke the next morning unable to lift her arms to brush her teeth. From there, it was on to Cincinnati, where she retired after the first set of her first match because she couldn’t find the energy to soldier on.Everywhere Wozniacki went, she saw doctors, she said, who proclaimed her fit and sent her away with medication for a head cold or influenza.“The doctors did blood tests, but they weren’t addressing the inflammation, which was the weird thing,” said Wozniacki, who found it stranger still that after years of wearing opponents down with her fitness, she was the one tiring first in her matches.From Cincinnati, Wozniacki traveled to New York, where she maintains an apartment, and insisted on undergoing a comprehensive battery of tests, one of which came back positive for rheumatoid arthritis. Wozniacki was relieved finally to have a diagnosis but refrained from reading up on the disease, she said, because she wanted to focus on the United States Open.After her second-round loss to Lesia Tsurenko, Wozniacki typed “rheumatoid arthritis” into a search engine on her phone during the ride back to her apartment and quickly educated herself on this new and formidable opponent. She made an appointment to see a New York-based rheumatologist, who assuaged her fears.“She said a lot of people she works with can live a normal life with it,” Wozniacki said.Of course, Wozniacki’s physically challenging, globe-trotting existence is nobody’s idea of a normal life.“I asked her: ‘What about my tennis? What about my career?’” Wozniacki said. “And she said, ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to figure it out.’”In Monday’s match, Wozniacki expressed surprise at Van Uytvanck’s tactic of hitting drop shots from behind the baseline, as if to test her speed and stamina.But Wozniacki figured it out and hit a few back for winners. “I’m like, ‘Wow, I actually got to them, hit it well, I kind of complimented myself on a couple of them,” she said with a laugh, not bothering to disguise her delight in showing how much life is left in her wheels."
"Halep Sees Off Wang, Will Face Pliskova in Miami Semis - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Simona Halep overcame a hiccup in the second set to secure a 6-4 7-5 Miami Open quarter-final victory over China's Wang Qiang on Wednesday, putting the Romanian one win away from reclaiming the world's top ranking from Naomi Osaka.Standing in her way will be Karolina Pliskova, who endured a blip of her own in the second set before defeating Marketa Vondrousova 6-3 6-4 in the evening session.Halep broke Wang three times to race into a 4-1 lead before closing out the first set when she cut off the angle on a short forehand and blasted a winner into the open court.But Wang came out firing in the second set, breaking Halep three times and holding to love in back-to-back service games to build a 5-1 lead.The second seed stormed back but Wang nearly forced a third set when she quickly jumped out to 0-40 in the 10th game, only for the Romanian's confident net play to get her out of the jam.Halep then went on to wrap up the win over 18th-seeded Wang in 89 minutes and match her best effort in Miami, which came in 2015 when she lost to Serena Williams in the semis.""Playing again in the semi-finals is going to be a big challenge. And maybe I can do my best result here and play in the final,"" Halep said on court. ""It's going to be a big match in the next round.""Halep is the highest seed left in the draw following Osaka's third-round exit and she said that while she is aware she can reclaim top spot in the rankings it is not something she is overly concerned about.""If I play well, if I play my best tennis, I have a better chance to become number one again,"" said Halep. ""But it's not in my mind. I just want to find my rhythm, to find my level and just play as good as possible.""Halep will have her hands full when she battles the towering Pliskova on Thursday. The Czech won six of the final seven games against the aggressive Vondrousova thanks to solid defence, an overpowering forehand and booming serve. The fifth seed, who lost her last meeting with Halep, a three-setter at last month's Fed Cup, could potentially reach world number two by winning the tournament.Recent form does not bode well for her, however.""I practiced with Simona before the Miami Open and I lost 0-6,"" she said. ""So it can only get better."" (Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto and Rory Carroll in Los Angeles, editing by Ed Osmond/Peter Rutherford)"
"At Indian Wells, It’ll Be Federer vs. Nadal for the 39th Time. Maybe. - The New York Times
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — After another day of big serves and topspin forehands in the desert sunshine, just about everyone appeared to get what they wanted: a 39th match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.The question is, will it actually happen?Federer, despite being the elder at 37, looks readier to rumble. Between Dubai and Indian Wells, he has won nine straight matches and 15 straight sets and artfully and uneventfully dispatched the unseeded Hubert Hurkacz, 6-4, 6-4, in Friday’s first quarterfinal of the BNP Paribas Open.But Nadal had to dig much deeper to wriggle free of the firm grip and aggressive game of Karen Khachanov, the brawny young Russian who pushed him hard in the third round of last year’s United States Open.This time, Nadal prevailed, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), but only after Khachanov stretched him repeatedly with huge serves and whipping forehands and only after Nadal needed on-court treatment and tape for pain in his long-troublesome right knee.And there lies the problem with planning your day or, depending on the time zone, your night around watching No. 39.Nadal remains one of the greatest, in-the-moment competitors in any sport, but his recent record in hardcourt tournaments is a downbeat litany of withdrawals, retirements and anticlimaxes.It remains an open question if he will feel hearty enough to play Saturday afternoon’s semifinal. He does not have a day off to recover. He also has the rest of the 2019 season to consider, including his sacrosanct season within a season on clay that is scheduled to start next month in Monte Carlo.“Of course my goal and my idea is to be ready for tomorrow,” Nadal said after pursing his lips and shaking his head.But he also knows from long experience with patellar tendinitis that being ready is no sure thing.“I cannot guarantee how I will feel when I wake up tomorrow,” he said. “But the desire to play a match like this against Federer is always very special, and it’s even more special if we’re both at a high level and at 100 percent. Hopefully it will be that way, above all for me but also for the fans on site and for fans in general. I hope I will be able to play aggressively. I need to be ready to react very quickly and to have everything in place to be able to succeed. If not, it will be very difficult.”Nadal and Federer first played in Miami in 2004, but they have not met since October 2017, when Federer beat Nadal in the final of the Shanghai Masters. Federer went 5-0 against Nadal in 2017, a resurgent season for both men, after upgrading his ability to attack with his single-handed backhand.That run of success has narrowed the big edge that Nadal once held in their rivalry; he now leads by 23-15.“I don’t think those five matches matter that much, to be honest,” Federer said of the 2017 victories. “A lot of time has gone by, unfortunately maybe for the rivalry for us, or for me. It’s always better to keep on maybe playing against him.”Federer started this season by failing to retain his title at the Australian Open but has responded by going on a roll. After winning his 100th career title in Dubai, Federer is now two victories from his 101st. To get there, he may first have to deal with the man who has been his friendly rival for 15 years and who remains a friend: The two had coffee at Federer’s rented home last week to discuss the state of the tennis world.“Different styles, different ways to understand the sport,” Nadal said. “And at the same time, two players with a good relationship after all the things that we went through in our careers, competing for the most important things.”In his first match against Hurkacz, a rangy and powerful 22-year-old from Poland, Federer looked loose from the start as he tested the full range of his skill set.There was the usual: wickedly sliced backhands, blocked returns and first serve-forehand combination punches. There was also the unusual: chip and charge tactics, serve-and-volley on second serve and no-look flicked backhand overheads.But it will be hard to be quite so relaxed and experimental against Nadal, whose ability (when healthy) to extend rallies and take command of them with his left-handed, topspin forehand is an entirely different, though much more familiar, challenge.The two did not play any of the same regular ATP Tour events in 2018, and they did not face off in the three Grand Slam tournaments that they both played: the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open.Federer was asked if, after all these years, the matchup with Nadal still gave him more of a thrill than facing an unknown rising player.“I think a combination,” he said. “If it was only Rafa, I wouldn’t enjoy that as well. I think having the mix is the magic really for me. Playing against young guys to eventually get to Rafa, that’s exciting.”It was quite an achievement for Nadal to get to Federer through the 22-year-old Khachanov. He was visibly hampered by his knee trouble, which first required treatment on court with Khachanov leading by 2-1 in the second set. Visibly slower and unable to push off as powerfully with his legs to serve, he still found a way to grind and win.“It’s a special victory considering the way I was feeling,” Nadal said.Playing with pain has unfortunately become close to the rule on hardcourts for Nadal, who has long complained and warned about the physical toll of hardcourt play.Nadal, 32, conceded that part of the problem was playing more than 1,100 matches in his career, not just playing on hardcourts. But he also pointed out that other sports tended to be played regularly on grass or on other more forgiving surfaces.“I love to play on hard, but probably my body doesn’t love it that much,” he said. “And my feeling is there are a lot of players that love to play on hard, true, but their bodies don’t love to play on hard, either.”He is also concerned about the price he and others might pay in retirement. “When I see some old legends walking around the tour,” he said, “it’s tough.”"
"Two Women Who Stuck With It Win Aussie Doubles Crown - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — There’s no rewinding the results in sports, as New Orleans fans still fuming about last week’s N.F.C. Championship game can attest. But sometimes, as Sam Stosur proved Friday at the Australian Open, it is possible to get it right the second time.In 2006, Stosur, a Queenslander playing in the women’s doubles final in her home Grand Slam, lost her service while attempting to close out the match in the second set. Stosur and her doubles partner, Lisa Raymond, squandered two championship points on their way to a three-set defeat to the Chinese team of Yan Zi and Zheng Jie.Thirteen years later, Stosur was back in the women’s doubles final, this time alongside China’s Zhang Shuai. They were playing the defending champions, Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, and again Stosur was serving in the second set to close out the match.Stosur earned a championship point, which she squandered with a double fault. But the past doesn’t have to be prologue. On the next point, Stosur produced an overhead winner to end a 25-shot rally. Then she watched the 13th shot of the next point sail long, near her feet, to seal her 6-3, 6-4 victory with Zhang at Rod Laver Arena.It was sweet redemption for Stosur, not only because of her near miss in 2006 but also because of all her quick exits here in the singles competition. Since defeating Serena Williams in the final to win the 2011 United States Open, Stosur, 34, has exited in the first round in singles in this tournament five times, including the past four years.Stosur held her head high after her latest opening-round defeat, last week in straight sets to Dayana Yastremska, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, of whom she said, “I think she’s going to be a very good player.”Stosur, who won the mixed doubles here in 2005 with Scott Draper, immediately turned her attention to the women’s doubles. “I think probably for any singles player, playing doubles can almost feel more relaxing or more fun,” she said.In Zhang, Stosur found a partner whose wit is as sharp as her net play. She kept Stosur loose — and occasionally made her laugh out loud — with her on-court comments. “If we could transfer that a little bit into the singles court, that would be a good thing,” Stosur said.Zhang, 30, had exited in the first round in singles in all 14 majors she had played and was contemplating retirement in early 2016 when Stosur sent her a long and passionate text encouraging her to continue playing. Zhang then advanced to the quarterfinals in singles at the 2016 Australian Open as a qualifier — still her best finish in singles in a major — and now, on the strength of Stosur’s powers of persuasion, she can call herself a Grand Slam champion.“Really important message,” Zhang said, smiling, of Stosur’s long-ago text.These two weeks, Zhang added, have been the most “amazing in my life.”Stosur said she had been in communication with Raymond, who told her the other night in a text: “Go get it 13 years later. Get it now.” Stosur said, “That was really nice.”The stands were roughly half full for the final but wholly behind Stosur and Zhang, ringing the stadium with chants of “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy.”“You guys definitely are in a good mood right now,” Mladenovic said to the crowd during the on-court trophy presentation. “That was not our goal.”The walk from the court to the locker room took Stosur and Zhang nearly as long as Stosur’s opening service game, which lasted 10 minutes, because every few steps she was stopped by well-wishers. Tournament workers applauded when Stosur emerged from a media-center elevator, and she received more applause from reporters as soon as she stepped inside the main interview room.“I think to be able to play at home is super exciting,” Stosur said. “I can feel my phone going off every two seconds at the moment. It’s great to know that the support’s there from everyone that’s close to you, but also feeling it from people you don’t even know who are happy and excited, it’s an amazing feeling.”"
"Maria Sharapova Beats Caroline Wozniacki in a Third-Round Grudge Match - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Maria Sharapova walked up to the dais as if she were walking into a bash. She wore a black crop top that fell to her waist and tights that were shimmery and chic.“I don’t pull those out too often,” she chirped to a roomful of reporters, referring to the top. “I’m really happy.”Known for her frosty reserve on the court, Sharapova was in a celebratory mood on Friday after dispatching the reigning champion and No. 3 seed, Caroline Wozniacki, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, in a third-round grudge match.Wozniacki, who is friends with the other women on the tour, and Sharapova, who keeps her competitors at arm’s length, are one-time Australian Open winners and full-time adversaries. Their clashing personalities don’t account for why they approached every point in the 2-hour, 24-minute slugfest as if they were playing for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup instead of a berth in the round of 16.At this tournament in 2016, Sharapova, the 2008 champion from Russia, tested positive for meldonium, which had been newly added to the sport’s banned substances list. Sharapova, who has steadfastly maintained that she was unaware of the change in the drug’s status, received a two-year ban that later was reduced to 15 months.When Sharapova returned to competition in 2017, many players, including Wozniacki of Denmark, were critical of her receiving wild cards and other forms of what they considered preferential treatment. That year, the animus between the pair seeped into the United States Open after Sharapova played a second-round match at Arthur Ashe Stadium while the much higher-seeded Wozniacki was relegated on the same day to an outside court, where she lost.In an interview afterward with a Danish newspaper, Wozniacki questioned putting “someone who comes back from a drugs sentence,” as she worded it, on the main show court. “I think it doesn’t set a good example,” she said.When Wozniacki’s comments were later relayed to her, Sharapova said it didn’t matter where she played, because all she cared about was that she was still in the tournament. Without mentioning Wozniacki by name, she added, “I’m not sure where she is.”Friday’s match at Rod Laver Arena was the 11th competitive meeting between Wozniacki and Sharapova, who holds a 7-4 edge. But it was the first time they’d played since Sharapova’s suspension.“It was definitely, you know, a match that I looked forward to when the draw came out,” said Sharapova, who conspicuously avoided looking at Wozniacki — and vice versa — during the prematch coin toss.But when they returned to the net nearly three hours later for the handshake, they made eye contact, two warriors to the battle born. Wozniacki’s strength is blasting balls from the baseline until her opponent blinks and, true to form, she engaged Sharapova in 23 rallies of at least nine shots. Sharapova won 17 of those points, including a 23-shot rally in the eighth game of the first set.“Those are the rallies that I think many years ago that she used to win,” Sharapova said. “I thought I did a great job of getting a higher percentage of wins in those.”Wozniacki had one forehand winner in the first two sets (to Sharapova’s 17) and prevailed in the second set despite hitting just one winner, off her backhand.“You know I did my best out there,” Wozniacki said. “I was fighting till the end.”Even as Wozniacki raced out to a 4-1 lead in the first set, she appeared to be long on guile and grit but short on gas. One of her second serves was clocked at 73 m.p.h. — and came back to her at 82 m.p.h.Wozniacki, 28, was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis before last year’s U.S. Open, and Friday’s weather, which included rain and some thunder and lightning, presented perfect conditions for a flare-up. In Wozniacki’s postmatch news conference, a reporter, who identified herself as a rheumatoid arthritis sufferer, said she had been in quite a bit of discomfort because of the weather and asked Wozniacki about her pain levels.“I’m O.K.,” Wozniacki said, adding, “Definitely don’t want to blame it on anything else. You know, she was just a little bit better than me today. And that was really it.”Wozniacki, who returned to the top of the women’s world rankings with her victory here last year, will tumble out of the top five when the new rankings come out after the tournament’s conclusion. She was asked if Friday’s defeat stung any less because she would forevermore be known as a major champion.“I’m a competitor,” Wozniacki said, adding, “I hate losing more than I love winning. Obviously you’re sitting here and you’re a little sad. But, you know, that’s what drives you.”The 31-year-old Sharapova regularly fields questions about her motivation. Her 2018 season ended prematurely, in September, after her surgically repaired right shoulder started giving her fits. According to Forbes, Sharapova, a five-time major winner who has completed the career Grand Slam, has earned more than $280 million in her career. With an ostrich-size nest egg, why does she persist with the constant travel and daily grind?The answer is simple, Sharapova said: For days like this.“I felt very much in the moment,” she said. “I felt present.”Sharapova added, “To be in the grind of things and to really have to figure out a way to be on top is what I missed.”"
"Federer to Face Isner in Miami Final - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Roger Federer cruised into his fifth Miami Open final with an impressive 6-2 6-4 victory against Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov on Friday.Federer was dominant in service and broke the 19-year-old three times to set up a final with American John Isner, who beat 18-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(3) 7-6(4).""I enjoyed it. I think I played very well. I had to,"" Federer told reporters. ""Because I think when you let Denis play, he's got some serious power, and he gets rhythm going. He can really put you in uncomfortable situations. ""So I think I did well, and I'm very happy how I played.""Federer took control of his semi-final early, breaking Shapovalov in the third game as his young opponent shanked a backhand.The Swiss, who won his 100th title earlier this month in Dubai, broke again in the third game of the second set and served his way into the final against defending champion Isner, who is yet to drop a set in the tournament this year.Isner, however, had to battle back in both sets against the 18-year-old Canadian, who led 5-3 in each set but was unable to seal the win.""For sure (it was) nerves,"" said Auger-Aliassime, the youngest men's semi-finalist in the tournament's 35-year history. ""It's like I caught a virus or something. I don't know. I couldn't put a second serve anymore. ""Even the first serve, if you put it in, you don't have to hit the second serve. That's just very tough to swallow.""Auger-Aliassime had appeared unbothered by being on the big stage against the crowd favorite playing attacking, aggressive tennis that rewarded him with the early break in each set.Yet serving for the set, the Canadian's inexperience and nerves were exposed when he produced three of his seven double faults and opened the door for the 33-year-old American who went on to take the first tiebreak 7-3.Auger-Aliassime regrouped and was on the attack again in the second, grabbing the early break to nose in front 4-2.Again serving for the set at 5-3, he let Isner back in the contest as the American got back on serve with the help of yet another Auger-Aliassime double fault.While Auger-Aliassime was misfiring, Isner's serve was booming, as he blasted 21 aces past his opponent.""I think it (experience) may have helped a little bit,"" said Isner.""But you see a lot of times where someone can have all the experience in the world or some teams can have all the experience in the world and they don't come through against an inexperienced opponent.""Maybe he was a little bit fatigued because he came through qualifying. So could have been a little bit of inexperience and maybe a little bit of fatigue, also.""

"It’s the Late, Late, Late Show at the Australian Open - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — “I’ve never done this before,” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said as she climbed on a stationary bike in front of a crowd that didn’t feel that much smaller than the one that had watched her 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3 upset of fifth-seeded Sloane Stephens at the Australian Open.The fourth-round match ended six minutes before 2 a.m. on Monday morning, and Pavlyuchenkova was mentally making a list of all the tasks that stood between her and a good morning’s sleep: the stationary bike, the reporters with their notebooks and microphones, the ice bath, the shower, the change of clothes, the drive back to the hotel.Pavlyuchenkova asked if she could field questions from reporters while she pedaled so she could kill two tasks with one bike ride. She was so tired, she had struggled to construct her points on the court, and now she was having trouble organizing her thoughts in front of reporters.That’s what a starting time of nearly half-past 11 will do to a player. “It’s honestly terrible,” Pavlyuchenkova said, adding, “It’s not ideal time to play tennis.”Describing the match, she said, “I was like, ‘This match is so intense, why am I like still sometimes feeling like I’m going to fall asleep now?’”The late, late, late show, with hosts Pavlyuchenkova and Stephens, started Sunday and ended Monday. Nine matches in the first eight days of the tournament ended after midnight, but Pavlyuchenkova’s win over Stephens wasn’t close to being the latest finish.It was 12 minutes past 3 a.m. on Friday when Garbiñe Muguruza clinched her second-round match against Johanna Konta. By the time Muguruza met with her coach, showered, changed out of her tennis outfit, received a massage, fulfilled her media obligations and returned to her hotel, it was one hour before sunrise.And Muguruza’s match wasn’t close to being the latest-ever finish in Australian Open history; that feather is in the pillows of Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis, whose third-round slugfest here in 2008, won by Hewitt, ended at 4:33 in the morning.The prime-time television hours in Muguruza’s native Spain are from 10:30 p.m. until 1 a.m., so she knows from flawed time systems.And yet, Muguruza, 25, readily acknowledged that playing that late “is not normal.” She added, “It was very awkward.”The post-midnight hours would pose no problem if the players had the body clocks of the mostly nocturnal koala bear, who can sleep up to 22 hours. But the human body’s inner clock has a circadian low, a window roughly between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., when focus, strength, reaction time and physical flexibility ebb, the better to promote sleep.The circadian rhythm can be reset by changing sleep or eating patterns. But how can players adjust their internal clocks for optimal performance when they’re playing at 2 a.m. one day and at 2 p.m. another?“There is no way to train that,” said Maria Sharapova, who advanced to the third round in a match that ended at 12:36 a.m. — or roughly two hours past her preferred bedtime.“If you ask any player that goes into this tournament how many times they have trained after midnight, unless you’re jet lagged or just crazy, you don’t train for that.”On the same night that Muguruza barely beat both Konta and daybreak, Novak Djokovic outlasted Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a match that ended 41 minutes past midnight. Djokovic, the men’s world No. 1, has a reputation for leaving few routes unexplored to gain a competitive edge. Over the years he has tried hyperbaric chambers, yoga, meditation, biofeedback and restrictive diets.So is he crazy enough to have tried practicing after midnight?“No, I have not done that I don’t think ever,” Djokovic said.He added with a laugh, “I’m not doing push-ups at midnight before I go to sleep. You train a bit later, and the whole routine is pushed back a little bit. But you also want to get a good night’s sleep so your biological rhythm keeps going in the right way.”Djokovic has one strategy, grudgingly adopted, that helps him sleep longer and sounder during tournaments: he leaves his two small children at home. He may be on to something. Norah Simpson, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford who studies the role of sleep on athletic performance, recommends that players get good, quality sleep in the days before matches so they don’t go into a late-night match already sleep-deprived.“It’s very challenging to navigate the variable schedule in respect to both your internal clock and the amount of sleep you’re able to obtain,” Simpson said in a telephone interview.The potential for late-night matches is part of tournaments with stadium lights and no curfews. Madison Keys played mostly night matches on her way to the final at the 2017 United States Open, and recalled going to bed after 4 a.m. many mornings, waking up around noon and taking power naps whenever she could. “It’s not natural,” she said, adding, “If I know I’m playing a night match, I sleep as much as I can the day before.”Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova’s coach, Simon Goffin, encouraged her to stay up until 1 a.m. the night before playing Stephens to help reset her body clock.“I pushed her to watch a movie, do something, even after midnight, to be used to this kind of late match,” said Goffin, who also insisted that she sleep in until noon. “It’s important for the body and the mind to have this routine.”Still, Pavlyuchenkova said she felt sluggish. “It was so, so strange because I was like ‘Come on, I have to make rallies!’” she said. “My energy level was on and off as well. I was trying to get as many energy drinks and gel packs as I could take.”After ingesting all that caffeine, how did Pavlyuchenkova plan to get to sleep? “I don’t know honestly,” she said, adding, “Try to take chamomile tea?”"
"Roger Federer Knocked From Australian Open by Stefanos Tsitsipas, Age 20 - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — A veteran right-hander with an all-court game and a one-handed backhand, the hands-down greatest player of his era, was trying to dodge an upset in a fourth-round match of a Grand Slam tournament against a former junior world No. 1 with long hair, a flowing one-handed backhand and no fear.In their first official head-to-head meeting, Pete Sampras, then 29, could not hold off a 19-year-old Roger Federer, who won in five sets at Wimbledon in 2001.On Sunday night at the Australian Open, Federer, the two-time defending champion, was the one looking across the net at a younger, fresher, more fearless version of himself. And like Sampras 18 years earlier, Federer had no answer for his fourth-round opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, a former junior world No. 1 from Greece who sent him packing with a 6-7 (11), 7-6 (3), 7-5, 7-6 (5) defeat in their first official head-to-head meeting.Federer was the 15th seed in 2001 when he beat Sampras, the top seed and a seven-time Wimbledon champion. Tsitsipas, 20, is the 14th seed and the youngest player remaining in the men’s draw. With the victory, Tsitsipas foiled the 37-year-old Federer’s bid to become the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals here since the 43-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1977.“I lost to a better player who was playing very well tonight,” said the third-seeded Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, including six titles in Australia. “He hung in there, gave himself chances at some point, stayed calm. It’s not always easy, especially for younger guys. Credit to him for taking care of that.”The match lasted 3 hours 45 minutes, but Federer essentially cinched his fate two hours in, after he squandered eight break points, including three on unforced errors, to give Tsitsipas enough of an opening to squeeze past him in the second set.“It definitely didn’t go the way I was hoping on the break points,” said Federer, who kept searching for a weakness to exploit only to see his strengths reflected back at him.Tsitsipas looked eminently comfortable at the net and he matched Federer winner for winner on the forehand side, with 15.“He did a nice job of taking care of his half volleys,” Federer said. “That’s maybe what won him the match tonight, I’m not sure.”Perhaps pride kept Federer from equivocating. The difference in the match was Tsitsipas’s youthful energy, which he oozed with his every Tigger-like step. Federer simply couldn’t match it from the first point to the last, a backhand that he netted.Federer wasted no time after the match completing his media responsibilities, leaving the clear impression that he couldn’t put this loss in his rearview mirror fast enough. His eyes grew glassy as his news conference wore on, as if his feelings about the loss had traveled from his mouth to his marrow.“I have massive regrets, you know, tonight,” said Federer, who also announced he intended to play some events on clay this spring after skipping clay-court season the past two years. “I might not look the part, but I am. I felt like I have to win the second set. I don’t care how I do it, but I have to do it.”Tsitsipas, who trains at the academy of Patrick Mouratoglou, whose best-known pupil is the 23-time major winner Serena Williams, was proud of the mental toughness he showed in fending off a dozen break points in all.“I could have cracked at any moment,” he said, “but I didn’t because I really wanted it bad.”Tsitsipas said he believed from the first point that he could pull off the upset and described the victory as “a beginning of something really big.”Tsitsipas broke onto the scene last year by reaching the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto in August, defeating four top-10 players, including Novak Djokovic, on the way.Tsitsipas is in the quarterfinals of a major for the first time. He will face 22d-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut, 30, who will also be playing his first Grand Slam quarterfinal.John McEnroe, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, conducted the post-match, on-court interview with Tsitsipas and described his victory as a changing of the guard.“I’ve heard that story the last 10 years,” Federer said. “From that standpoint, nothing new.”He had a point. Consider Grigor Dimitrov, now 27, who made it to the quarterfinals here in 2014. He lost Sunday to Frances Tiafoe and is 0 for 34 in majors.Before Dimitrov, there was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, now 33, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the 2008 final here and hasn’t advanced to another Grand Slam final.Even a player like Andy Murray, whose sterling career included major titles and wins over Federer, fell short of Federer’s gold standard.So, yes, the torch has been passed, only to get extinguished. But there was a hint of resignation in Federer’s voice and a slump in his shoulders during his news conference that belied the breeziness of his rebuttal to McEnroe’s observation.“About Stefanos, I think he’s definitely done a really nice job now the last year and a half,” Federer said, adding, “I see him definitely being high up in the game for a long time. This was a good night for him tonight.”After Sampras lost to Federer at Wimbledon, he won one more major, the 2002 United States Open, then retired. How many more chances will Federer get to grow his legacy?Federer looked irked when he was asked if he could see a bit of himself in Tsitsipas, the son of two tennis coaches, who has described Federer as his childhood idol.“He has a one-handed backhand and I used to have long hair, too,” Federer said. “Yeah, so maybe a little bit, sure.”"
"Bautista Agut Beats Djokovic to Reach Miami Quarters, Kyrgios Out - The New York Times
(Reuters) - A tenacious Roberto Bautista Agut battled back to beat world number one Novak Djokovic 1-6 7-5 6-3 and advance to the quarter-finals of the Miami Open on Tuesday as the Spaniard claimed his second win over the Serb this year. Six-times champion Djokovic blasted the 22nd seed off the court in the opening set but Bautista Agut grew more aggressive in the second, stepping in to take his second serves early and baiting his opponent into extended rallies. The tide turned in Bautista Agut's favor in the third when, after both players exchanged service breaks, an uncharacteristically sloppy Djokovic sent a backhand wide to fall behind 4-2.Three games later Bautista Agut smacked a forehand winner down the line to seal the win, which was reminiscent of Bautista Agut's come-from-behind victory over Djokovic in the semi-finals of the Qatar Open in January.""The key of the match was at the beginning of the second set,"" Bautista Agut said after his latest victory. ""I played more aggressive.""The loss capped a disappointing trip through the United States for Djokovic, who fell in straight sets to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells earlier this month. The Serb said he would ""rethink"" how he prepared for the early-season American swing next year.""I just had way too many things off the court,"" he said. ""I guess that affected me a little bit on the court.""I didn't feel my best health-wise, as well, in Indian Wells and here. You know, still rusty, but, hey, look, you learn that's life.""Djokovic was eliminated before an evening rain delay pushed Roger Federer's match against Russia's Daniil Medvedev back to Wednesday.Next up for Bautista Agut is a quarter-final date with defending champion John Isner, who was a 7-6(5) 7-6(3) winner over Britain's Kyle Edmund earlier in the day. KYRGIOS IN CONTROVERSY AGAINNick Kyrgios continued to mix the obscene with the sublime as he bowed out of the tournament at the hands of Borna Coric.The Australian produced perhaps the shot of the tournament, an audacious 'tweener' that caught a flat-footed Coric off guard early in his 4-6 6-3 6-2 loss to the 11th seed.Kyrgios was later given a point penalty for an audible obscenity, apparently directed at a spectator, that put him down a double break in the third.Kyrgios said he did not regret having a go at the spectator.""I'm playing for two hours and 20 minutes, and a guy yells at me, like 'play some tennis',"" Kyrgios explained.""I'm not going to take it... Probably not needed, but at that time, when you're competing and in the heat of the moment, it's probably not what you want to hear.""If I swear or something, then I'll lose the point. That's why I didn't argue it. I just walked to my chair.""Kyrgios has made headlines all week in Miami for his controversial underhanded serves, a verbal spat with another spectator who was heckling him, and for firing off an expletive-laden rant at an umpire during a doubles match.Up next for Coric will be a clash with 18-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime, who beat Georgian 17th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili 7-6(4) 6-4 to become the first qualifier to reach the last eight in Miami since Guillermo Canas in 2007.Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov advanced to the quarter-finals with a 4-6 6-3 7-6(3) win over Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, the tournament's eighth seed.In a late night match that lasted over two hours and finished at 1:40 AM local time, Shapovalov claimed only his second career win over an opponent in the top 10 in a 'Next Gen' battle.With compatriot Auger-Aliassime also in the quarters, it is the first time in 12 years that two teenagers have reached this stage of the tournament, after Andy Murray and Djokovic accomplished the feat as 19-year-olds in 2007.Shapovalov will take on American Frances Tiafoe in the next round.

"Federer Reaches Quarters in Miami, Halep Eyes No. 1 Ranking - The New York Times
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Roger Federer will face a hectic few days if he's going to win another Miami Open.He's off to a good start.Federer is through to the quarterfinals, having little trouble on the way to a 6-4, 6-2 victory over 13th-seeded Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday — needing only 61 minutes to prevail in a match where he committed a mere eight unforced errors. The match was supposed to be Tuesday and was pushed back a day because of rain.So now, to win what would be his fourth Miami title, Federer will have to prevail four times in a five-day span. Next up for the No. 4 seed is a quarterfinal Thursday against No. 6 seed Kevin Anderson — a match between the two highest seeds left on the men's side, and the biggest test yet for Anderson since his return from an elbow issue.""I'm feeling really good,"" Federer said. ""Today's match, I can be really happy with so I hope it's going to give me some confidence for tomorrow.""Federer and Medvedev split the first eight games, and then things turned quickly. Federer broke Medvedev for a 5-4 lead in the first set, fought off three break points to close out the set in the next game, and got another break to open the second set. He cruised home from there.""When you want to go deep in tournaments, sometimes you need those 15 minutes that go your way and you're able to pull away with the score too,"" Federer said of the break and then the rally from 0-40 down to serve out the opening set. ""Margins are super-slim and you need a bit of help sometimes from your opponent.""Federer leads the head-to-head against Anderson 5-1, the loss coming last year in the Wimbledon quarterfinals — Anderson winning 13-11 in the fifth set.""If you beat me at Wimbledon, you've got my attention,"" Federer said.Meanwhile, second-seeded Simona Halep also finished her match Wednesday with a flourish.And a return to the world's No. 1 ranking could be her reward.Halep beat 18th-seeded Qiang Wang 6-4, 7-5 in the quarterfinals. Halep won the final six games against Qiang and would return to No. 1 in the world if she wins her semifinal match Thursday night against fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova — a 6-3, 6-4 winner over unseeded Marketa Vondrousova in an all-Czech Republic quarterfinal.""I just found out from my coach that I need one more match to be No. 1 again,"" Halep said. ""It's pretty much in my head and I'm happy that I'm in this position again.""Pliskova fought off two break points in the final game, then prevailed when Vondrousova sent a forehand long on match point.""Night, it's perfect for me,"" Pliskova said.Pliskova is 2-7 head-to-head against Halep. They are the two highest seeds left in the women's draw; the other women's semi, set for Thursday afternoon, has 12th-seeded Ashleigh Barty against 21st-seeded Anett Kontaveit.""It's going to be, I think, a good match,"" Pliskova said of the looming matchup with Halep. ""With her the quality of the tennis is always good and the intensity is always good.""Halep has been No. 1 twice before, including most of 2018. She surrendered the ranking to Naomi Osaka in January, and didn't think she would have a chance to grab it back again this quickly.""It would mean a lot,"" Halep said.While Federer is just getting into the quarters, defending Miami champion John Isner of the U.S. became the first man in the field to reach the semifinals and did it in what's become his customary fashion. The seventh-seeded Isner ousted 22nd-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6 (1), 7-6 (5).Isner has won 10 straight matches at the tournament and hasn't dropped a set yet in this year's edition at Hard Rock Stadium — 8-0 in sets, 7-0 in tiebreakers. All but one of his sets have been 7-6 wins, the other being a 7-5 triumph. He had 24 aces Wednesday and faced only one break point.In his seven tournaments this year, Isner has played 47 sets — 24 of those going to tiebreaks. He'll face Canadian 18-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semifinals, after the teen topped 11th-seeded Borna Coric 7-6 (3), 6-2 on Wednesday night."
"Not-So-Hidden Cameras Take Australian Open Viewers on an Intimate Tour - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — After losing a close third-round match to Sloane Stephens at the Australian Open last week, Petra Martic kept her emotions in check as she walked off the court of Margaret Court Arena. But once she was out of sight of the crowd, in the tunnel connecting the arena to the locker room, she could no longer hide her distress. She stepped into a corner, sunk down against a cinder-block wall and broke down in heaving sobs as she covered her face with a towel.But she was not hidden at all. She was captured by one of the numerous cameras positioned throughout the corridors of the Australian Open.“It’s just heartbreaking to watch,” ESPN’s Chris McKendry said on the broadcast after the camera zoomed in for a tighter view of Martic’s misery.The Australian Open, the most remote Grand Slam event, is offering voyeurism without the voyage in a way no other tournament does. Players and their entourages are often unaware how many of their movements are monitored and magnified by cameras that follow them as long and as closely as possible.The tournament installed a few fixed cameras three years ago and now curates a feed from many remotely operated cameras that monitor the recently renovated players’ areas at Melbourne Park. The footage appears in segments of television broadcasts and can also be seen online in a stand-alone stream.“We live in Big Brother society,” top-ranked Novak Djokovic said of the cameras. “I guess you just have to accept it.”And so the tournament that branded itself the Happy Slam has become the Orwellian Open.Most of the widely broadcast moments are not as poignant as Martic’s. Look, there’s Roger Federer fist-bumping a passing Rafael Nadal. Over here, Gaël Monfils is doing an impression of Frances Tiafoe’s postmatch celebrations — for Tiafoe.Craig Tiley, the tournament director, would not say how many cameras were used, but he called them “a rich source of content” that would complement match coverage and reveal a more complete picture of the sport and its culture.Tiley said that the mounted cameras were intended to create a single source of video for rights-holding broadcasters, rather than having the hallways clogged with various camera operators and their equipment.Tiley said that there were “strict protocols about what could be shown, but that players were not all explicitly warned about the cameras or told to sign waivers agreeing to be shown at any time. The high-definition cameras are in areas otherwise off-limits to the public and, this year for the first time, to accredited news media.“The cameras are round and black and hang down from the ceiling,” Tiley said. “They are very easy to see, and we have had dozens and dozens of players and coaches playing up to them.”There are areas the cameras do not show, including the players’ restaurant and gym.“They’re not in the locker room, not that I know of,” Maria Sharapova said, smiling. “Safe there.”But many players and coaches did not realize the scope of the surveillance. Serena Williams, who starred in her own HBO reality show, “Being Serena,” and even gave birth on camera, said she initially did not notice how many cameras were tracking her at the tournament until she heard other players talking about them and began to look around.“Then I was, like, ‘Oh, there is a camera there; oh, there is one there,’ ” Williams said. “They are everywhere, which I actually didn’t realize. Good to know.”Naomi Osaka also underestimated the number of cameras watching her, thinking there was only one. “I guess I will be very conscious,” she said.Sure enough, before her next match, she could be seen looking for as many cameras as she could spot, laughing as she found one after another.Simona Halep said she had not realized just how ubiquitous the cameras were until she saw images of herself that she did not know had been recorded.“You guys are filming everything,” Halep said. “I saw everything. I saw when I hugged my mom!”But she did not consider the cameras a bad thing. “It’s nice,” Halep said. “People can see our reactions, off-court moments.”Even Martic gained something positive from being caught in a vulnerable moment. She posted on Instagram that she had received an outpouring of supportive messages from fans who had seen her devastation.Mostly, the captured scenes are mundane: players saying hello as they pass one another in the halls, or entering and exiting the parking lot, or standing around and watching the television monitors, or stretching before matches.Like most reality shows, the Open video stream has the tantalizing prospect of romance. The cameras seemed to have a particular interest in Monfils and Elina Svitolina, who recently started dating.Occasionally, a small moment will become viral, such as when Federer tried to enter the locker room without his credential and was stopped by a security guard.“There is the incredible camaraderie among players and coaches and the tennis community,” Tiley said. “It is a community and an environment that we try to capture respectably and appropriately.”Players were caught off guard when the cameras first appeared in 2016. At the time, they had microphones that picked up conversations and showed the lounge area of the locker room.The cameras no longer record sound and are now mostly in areas that players pass through rather than where they sit and congregate for long periods.Patrick Mouratoglou, who is Williams’s coach and an analyst for ESPN and Eurosport, said there should be more cameras to make new audiences invested in the players as people.“I think we have to really worry about seducing the young generations with our sport,” Mouratoglou said. “Our sport is very, very conservative — which is good because we respect the history of the game, that’s great — but also we have to live in our times.”Indeed, the player most engaged in modern media seems to enjoy the continual cameras more than anyone else. Stefanos Tsitsipas, who spends much of his time off the court filming himself and the world around him for his YouTube channel, has been fascinated by the cameras he has spotted around the tournament.As he waited to face Rafael Nadal in the semifinals in Melbourne on Thursday, Tsitsipas paced back and forth and stared at a camera, watching it move with him.For superstars like Federer, who has photographs taken of him with and without his permission whenever he is in public, the cameras at the Australian Open were simply an extension of a creeping loss of privacy.“It’s different times nowadays,” Federer said. “Sometimes good, sometimes bad. It’s not like we never have anybody taking pictures or videos of us. Now it’s just like everywhere all the time. It’s hard to find the corner where you can actually sort of relax a bit.”One fish-eye-view camera at Rod Laver Arena, perched inside the players’ box, has been particularly irksome to coaches and supporters. During Lucas Pouille’s quarterfinal match on Wednesday, his fiancée, Clemence Bertrand, tried covering it with a bag of peanut M&Ms; his coach, Amélie Mauresmo, obscured it with a sweatshirt.Sascha Bajin, Osaka’s coach, said that he was self-conscious about the cameras in his face during matches, and that he was trying to stay away from the ones in the corridors.“If they’re hidden too much,” he said, “then I feel like they’re just kind of trying to catch you on something, you know?”"
"Yale Ex-Coach Pleads Guilty in Bribery Scandal - The New York Times
BOSTON — A former women's soccer coach at Yale University pleaded guilty Thursday to taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for pretending applicants were recruits to boost their chances of getting into the school.Rudy Meredith, 51, is the third person to plead guilty in the wide-ranging school admissions scandal in which authorities say wealthy parents paid an admissions consultant to rig their children's test scores and bribe coaches at sought-after schools. Prominent parents charged with paying bribes include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin .Meredith, who resigned from Yale in November, began cooperating with the FBI last year after investigators set up a sting in a Boston hotel room and caught him soliciting a $450,000 bribe from a father. He helped investigators unravel the wider bribery scheme by leading them to the admissions consultant, who later agreed to work with investigators and recorded his conversations with parents.Meredith, wearing sunglasses and a dark suit, said nothing as he and his lawyers fought through a swarm of reporters to leave the federal courthouse in Boston after the hearing. His attorneys declined to comment.The FBI's investigation into the admissions scam began after a Los Angeles executive who was under investigation in Boston for securities fraud told authorities that Meredith offered to designate the executive's daughter as a recruit in exchange for cash, officials say.In April 2018, the executive and Meredith met in a Boston hotel room that was bugged by the FBI.Authorities say the coach told the father he would help his daughter get into Yale in exchange for $450,000. The executive gave Meredith $2,000 in cash, and another $4,000 was wired to Meredith from a bank account controlled by the FBI, according to court documents.During the meeting, Meredith also mentioned the admissions consultant, Rick Singer, which was the first time that authorities had heard his name, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen told the judge Thursday.Meredith began cooperating that same month with investigators, who recorded phone calls between the coach and Singer that revealed the extent of the bribery scheme.""We had learned through the telephone calls that this obviously wasn't related to a single bribe or single coach but rather a scheme, a scheme to defraud universities,"" Rosen said.Investigators obtained Meredith's bank records, which showed that Singer had paid the coach more than $860,000, Rosen said.In one case, authorities say Meredith accepted a $400,000 bribe to get an applicant admitted as a recruit even though he knew she didn't play competitive soccer.Prosecutors say the consultant, Singer, sent Meredith a fake athletic profile that described the student as the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in southern California. The applicant's relatives paid Singer about $1.2 million, officials say.Yale said Monday that it has rescinded the admission of a student linked to the bribery scandal. The school has said it believes Meredith gave ""fraudulent athletic endorsements"" for only two applicants. The other was denied admission despite Meredith's endorsement, the school said.Singer has pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy. Meredith pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy charges.Another coach, Michael Center, also appeared in Boston's federal court Thursday but didn't enter a plea. Center, who was the men's tennis coach at the University of Texas at Austin, is accused of accepting nearly $100,000 to help a non-tennis playing applicant get admitted as a recruit. Once enrolled, the student never played. An email was sent to Center's attorney Thursday.Several other coaches pleaded not guilty on Monday, including tennis coach Gordon Ernst, who is accused of getting $2.7 million in bribes to designate at least 12 applicants as recruits to Georgetown and was the personal tennis coach for former first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters.Loughlin and Huffman are set to make their initial appearances in Boston federal court next week. They have not publicly commented on the allegations.___"
"New Davis Cup Goes Virtual to Increase Sponsorship Revenue - The New York Times
MADRID — The changes in the Davis Cup go beyond its revamped format.In addition to a new playing formula that will bring nations together for a weeklong tournament in a single venue, the Davis Cup is also implementing a new sponsorship strategy that will make tennis' top team competition look different to television viewers — all depending on where they are watching it.The group behind the new Davis Cup — led by Barcelona defender Gerard Pique — is planning to use virtual replacement advertising during broadcasts at the inaugural ""World Cup"" of tennis in Madrid from Nov. 18-24, meaning sponsors' logos and banners will be superimposed digitally on the courts. A viewer in the United States will see something different than one in Asia or one in Europe, or those watching matches in person at Madrid's ""Magic Box"" tennis complex.The strategy adds flexibility to sponsors and will allow organizers to sell different sponsorship packages worldwide, widening revenue possibilities. Instead of having one presenting sponsor for the whole tournament, organizers can sign deals with multiple companies.""One of the things that happens in terms of sponsorship is that it is pretty difficult to find one of those global brands that has interest all over the world,"" Kosmos Tennis CEO Javier Alonso told The Associated Press. ""With the modern technologies that are available right now on the market ... we are targeting to have three or four different feeds and in each feed we will have a different sponsor with virtual replacement technology.""Even global companies could take advantage of the new model, as they can promote specific products in different markets. A car company could advertise one vehicle in Europe and another in Asia, and a beer company could promote one product in South America and another in Oceania.The technology, called ""DBR,"" or digital board replacement, is already being used successfully by the Spanish soccer league, a sponsor and partner of the revamped Davis Cup. The league says it was one of the first competitions to implement the virtual sponsorship strategy some five years ago, and currently it distributes specific feeds to nine different regions.""It's a format that is much more attractive to sponsors,"" said Oscar Mayo, the Spanish league's director for international development. ""It's a model fully developed and we will share our know-how and provide support.""The technology allows for customized images to be superimposed anywhere on the field without being affected by camera movement or the position of players. It is used especially on sideline boards and the ""3D"" carpets near the goals in soccer matches. Similar technologies have been used in broadcasts of auto racing, golf tournaments and American football games, showing speeds, distances and first-down markers to add to the viewers' experience.Kosmos' goal is to have at least three separate regions with specific feeds in this inaugural season, expanding it to more territories and new sponsors in the coming years.""At the end of the day, you can multiply by three or four the income that you are generating because the expense is not huge,"" Alonso said.The added costs are usually related to the need of having more satellites to distribute the different feeds. Kosmos estimates an extra cost of about 100,000 euros ($112,000) for each additional feed.The plan to use the new technology was already in the long-term plans for Kosmos, the investment group founded by Pique, but it was fast-tracked after longtime Davis Cup sponsor BNP Paribas decided last month not to continue investing in the competition. The bank said it would end its 17-year title sponsorship ""as the competition's format evolves.""""It was a surprise when it happened but we already had another plan, so we could handle it,"" Alonso said. ""Already with what we have signed (in sponsors), I would say probably we already have 30 or 40 percent of what they had before. We are OK.""Davis Cup organizers said the new formula, with all matches played in a single week and at the same venue, has been key to attracting new sponsors.""People understand the concept of one city, one location, everyone together, so it's been a good response to the change,"" ITF president David Haggerty told the AP. ""Under the old format you weren't sure where the finals would be, so if you were a business you didn't know if it would be a country that was important to your business or not, whereas here everyone knows the next two years we are in Madrid and companies can make a very informed decision.""The Spanish league said the new format was crucial for its decision to join in.""This new event has a lot more visibility compared to before,"" Mayo said. ""It will be at the same level as the great sporting events in the world, bringing together fans and players from several countries.""The season-ending tournament will feature 18 teams drawn into six groups of three, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage, along with the two-best second-place teams. The nations will play within their groups Monday-Thursday, with the knockout rounds Friday-Sunday. The matches will take place on hard courts in three stadiums in morning and afternoon sessions that will include two singles matches and a doubles match between two nations.The new Davis Cup is part of a 25-year partnership between Kosmos and the ITF, which made the deal to try to increase revenue for the local tennis federations.______"
"The 145-Pound Long Snapper and Other Tales of College Admissions Puffery - The New York Times
The ruse was oddly simple. Since college coaches can often recommend more athletes to the admissions department than a team needs, why not buy a few slots from the coaches and sell them to parents desperate to get their children into the most selective universities?Perhaps the most remarkable thing about William Singer’s scheme was how easily he could have been found out. With a handful of keystrokes, or maybe a phone call, admissions officers could have discovered that applicants were simply posing as athletes. Then it might have been discovered that a purported pole-vaulter had probably never touched a pole, that a long snapper had stopped playing football, that a supposedly fast swimmer wasn’t fast at all. Indeed, the doctored photographs used to support claims of athletic ability are pretty unconvincing. Yet as simple as it would have been to uncover the plot, the scheme lasted at least seven years, according to the federal indictment detailing the fraud led by Singer. Singer pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges on Tuesday, when documents from the case were made public. Among other things, those documents provided information on the applications of the following students:Gamal Abdelaziz, a resident of Las Vegas and a former casino executive, stands accused of bribing Donna Heinel, the University of Southern California associate athletic director, to designate his daughter as a recruit for the U.S.C. basketball team.To make that happen, Abdelaziz’s daughter needed to be portrayed as a standout basketball player. Singer is said to have enlisted an assistant soccer coach at U.S.C. named Laura Janke to create a profile of a girl who starred for a high school team in Asia, garnering such honors as “Asia Pacific Activities Conference All Star Team,” “2016 China Cup Champions,” “Hong Kong Academy team M.V.P.,” and “team captain.”During a phone call in January, according to the documents, Singer told Abdelaziz that the admissions office had asked Heinel why Abdelaziz’s daughter did not end up on the basketball team. According to Singer, Heinel told the admissions official that the daughter had sustained an injury over the summer that would cause her to be out for six to eight months. Plantar fasciitis was the diagnosis, Singer said. Heinel and at least one U.S.C. coach named in the case have been fired. In 2017, Heinel presented the son of a media executive named Elisabeth Kimmel  to U.S.C.’s subcommittee for athletic admissions. The son was supposedly a three-year varsity letter-winner in track and field and one of the top pole-vaulters in California.His application sailed through, gaining approval on Oct. 10, 2017, even though the boy’s high school had no record of his ever taking part in the pole vault. This was apparently familiar territory for Kimmel, who the documents said had used Singer to gain admission to Georgetown for her daughter as a tennis player. Her daughter didn’t play a single match for the Hoyas during her four years at the school. In the case of her son, Kimmel expressed concern that he was supposed to register with the N.C.A.A., and for him to do that, his high school was going to have to send his records. That might be a problem, Kimmel is said to have told Singer, because her son’s guidance counselor knew he was not a pole-vaulter. Eventually Kimmel figured out how to send the paperwork to the N.C.A.A. herself, but another hiccup occurred when Kimmel’s son appeared on campus: His adviser asked him about his athletic exploits. The boy — who was not in on the scheme, according to his mother — told the adviser that he had no idea what she was talking about and that there had to have been some mistake. According to Kimmel, the adviser said she was going to check into it. As of January, according to court filings, Kimmel’s son was “still in the dark” about the way he had gained admission. The University of Texas has an excellent men’s tennis team, routinely ranked among the top 20 in the country. In 2015, Singer said, he approached the team’s head coach, Michael Center, about a potential student from Los Altos Hills, Calif., an affluent suburb in Silicon Valley. Could Center facilitate admission for the boy as a tennis recruit? The boy’s application listed him as a manager of his high school basketball and football teams. The only tennis mentioned in his application was one year of playing as a high school freshman. Regardless, Center secured the boy a scholarship that covered the cost of books. The boy arrived at Texas for the 2015-16 school year and renounced his scholarship and his participation on the tennis team on Sept. 4, 2015. The university announced on Wednesday that Center had been fired.Marci Palatella, the chief executive of a liquor distribution company in Burlingame, Calif., was looking for a way to get her son into U.S.C., and Singer suggested athletics. That might be a problem, Palatella is said to have replied, because her son had stopped playing football. Nevertheless, the court documents said, a profile was created for Palatella’s son portraying him as an active player on his high school football team — as part of the defensive line and as a long snapper and also as a member of several local and statewide championship teams from 2015 to 2017. Later, Singer would be heard on tape bragging about such a scheme to another client, William E. McGlashan Jr., a senior executive at a global private equity firm.“Well I had a boy last year, I made him a long snapper,” Singer said.“I love it,” McGlashan replied. “He was 145 pounds. Long snapper,” Singer said.“I love it. I love it,” McGlashan said. “That is so funny.”For McGlashan, Singer opted for a different strategy, since the long snapper ruse had just been used. McGlashan’s son played lacrosse, but U.S.C. did not have a lacrosse team. So the boy was described as a kicker, even though his high school had no football team. No problem, Singer explained, “because they have all these kicking camps, and these kickers always get picked up outside of the school.”"
"Japan's Imperial Couple Faces a Nearly Unprecedented Situation: Retirement - The New York Times
TOKYO — When Japanese Emperor Akihito abdicates on April 30, he and Empress Michiko will fade into retirement after decades in the spotlight.The imperial couple's days have long been busy. They typically hosted hundreds of ceremonies and audiences annually, made at least three domestic trips per year, and have visited over 50 countries.Nearly all that will end when his son, Crown Prince Naruhito, becomes emperor on May 1 after Akihito steps down, the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in two centuries.""The new emperor must become a new symbol,"" said Makoto Watanabe, a former aide to Akihito. ""The (retiring) emperor has thought seriously about how to avoid the problem of dual authority. His daily schedule is expected to almost completely disappear.""The retired couple, to be known as emperor emeritus and empress emerita, will return to Togu Palace, where they lived before Akihito became emperor, after a stay in a now-vacant imperial residence while their new home is renovated.They will have fewer aides, but the government will still pay their living expenses.Michiko has many interests, including music and literature so will likely have little trouble filling her days, several acquaintances say. Akihito may have a rougher time, having been focused entirely on his job, they added. Friends had hoped Akihito would have time to indulge his love of tennis, but that could be tough given his age.""He hasn't played recently,"" said Kazuo Oda, a tennis buff who was present when Akihito met Michiko on the court in 1957 and arranged phone calls between the couple.One idea is for friends to present them with a ping-pong table.""He likes table tennis,"" Oda said.The royal pair were asked at a news conference in 2007 what the would do if they could mingle incognito with the public.Akihito replied, ""Right now, I cannot think of anything I want to do,"" although he added he would be glad to have more time to enjoy nature and do research.The emperor's hobby has been marine biology, especially goby fish.He has been treated for prostate cancer and had heart surgery; in 2016 he said he feared age would make it hard to fulfill his duties.""I think he'll be relieved"" to step back from public life, one acquaintance said.(For graphic on Japan's royal family, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2VbRE9L) CONSOLING THE MARGINALIZEDThe aging couple will leave an enduring image of consoling the marginalized in society - from leprosy patients to the elderly, people with handicaps and disaster victims. Acquaintances and scholars agree Michiko took the lead in that public outreach. The first commoner to marry into Japan's royal family, Michiko once lost her voice after harsh attacks by tabloids.""She was bullied and harassed ... but in a sense, Michiko created a revolution - to get closer to the people,"" said Naotaka Kimizuka, a professor at Kanto Gakuin University. Michiko has said her personal troubles helped her understand others.""I sometimes have a sense that in my state of sadness and uncertainty, I find myself quietly connecting with other people,"" she told a 2007 news conference.Akihito recognized her role in a poem written when the two were courting: ""As I continue my talks with her, I become aware that, in my heart, a window is opening.""

"John Isner Is Always Looking for Extra Leg Room - The New York Times
The tennis player John Isner is tall. Very tall. 6 feet 10 inches, to be exact. Which means that traveling on a plane to tournaments around the world, which the Dallas resident does roughly 11 months a year, can be a daunting task. And the biggest annual challenge comes every January, when the Australian Open is played, requiring Mr. Isner, who lost in the first round this year, as well as many other American tennis players, to spend many hours in the air on their way to Melbourne.Ahead of the Open, Mr. Isner talked about his travel strategies. Over time he’s learned not only how to keep his legs stretched but also ensure his body is in top shape for the tournament ahead. The following is an edited version of the conversation.What kind of traveler are you? When you go on vacation, are you looking for adventure, relaxation, culture — all three?Usually I’m traveling for tennis, so the most important thing for me is to not get jet lag. Over the years it’s stopped being an issue. What I do, the first very thing once I’ve gotten settled in a hotel, is break a sweat. You have to sweat it out; the airplane is too gross. I’ll practice tennis or go to the gym. If I don’t have time I’ll use the sauna or steam room. I used to do the opposite. There was one time I flew back to Dallas from Asia, and I started partying a bit. I was so messed up with the time that I didn’t feel that tired. But it was the absolute worst thing I could have done. I felt awful for a week.Do you sleep on the plane? Read? watch movies?I’ve learned how to sleep on airplanes. When I’m taking a trans-Atlantic flight or going to a different continent, I will always read because reading puts me to sleep. When you watch a movie, you have all that light coming to your eyes, but with reading, I can’t get through 15 or 20 pages. In addition to sleeping, I also need to make sure I can stretch my legs a lot. For the most part I’m traveling in business class, but the toughest part for me is travel within Europe. Going from country to country, there really is no business class on these flights. I went from Stockholm to Vienna, and that flight was miserable. The leg room was extremely limited. I folded up like a lawn chair. I got up and walked around and made sure I drank a lot of water to make myself use the restroom to get up even more. It wasn’t the most enjoyable two hours, but I got through it.Are there certain things you always take with you?I try to bring a lot of water on the plane with me and eat a really good meal. I stopped eating airplane food; it’s not that good. I’ll eat a nice meal somewhere, and then I’ll just bring snacks on the plane — nuts and some fruit and some protein powder. I don’t dread long flights anymore.What’s been your favorite trip?I played an event in Thailand twice, and it’s always around New Year’s. Just getting there is hard. We flew into Bangkok from Los Angeles, which was long, but turned out nice. From there we (my then-girlfriend, now wife) took a private plane to this absolutely amazing resort in the city of Hua Hin. That was probably one of my favorite times ever. It was at the beginning of the tennis season, and I was there for tennis, but I actually got to have a lot of fun as well.When you are on a tennis tour, do you get to see any of the cities you’re traveling to, or are you just in and out?It all depends. For instance, in Stockholm, I had no time to see anything. I arrived late and played every match at night, finishing at 11 o’clock. It all depends on how the tournament goes. If you are doing well and winning, you don’t have any time at all. If, unfortunately, you lose early, it opens up time to see these amazing cities. What has been one of your favorite side trips?I was in Paris for a tournament, and I had time before it started. So my wife and I went to Normandy, which is two-and-a-half hours away. We left at 6 a.m., and we got there around 9 a.m. We stayed until around 3 or 4. We went to some of the beaches, and to this day it is the coolest thing I’ve done with my time on the road. It’s incredible. It’s super windy. It’s hard to explain; there is this cold wind, and you wear a beanie, and it’s great."
"Felicity Huffman and 13 Others to Plead Guilty in College Admissions Scandal - The New York Times
Felicity Huffman, the Hollywood actress, on Monday laid out a list of failings: Yes, she had paid a college counselor $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT test. And yes, it had backfired miserably, turning what Ms. Huffman said had been an effort to help her daughter into a betrayal of her.“I am ashamed,” Ms. Huffman said, announcing that she will plead guilty to a federal crime, part of a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by prosecutors in Boston.In the statement issued by Ms. Huffman, she said she wanted to apologize to her family, friends and colleagues, and especially, she said, “to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.”Ms. Huffman was one of 50 people charged in a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by federal prosecutors in Boston. On Monday, prosecutors said that 14 people — 13 parents and one coach — would plead guilty in the case. Dates for the formal pleas in court had yet to be set.Ms. Huffman said that her daughter had been unaware of the cheating — prosecutors say a proctor corrected her test answers after she had left. And Ms. Huffman acknowledged that, in an attempt to assist her daughter, she had ultimately hurt and betrayed her.“This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,” she said. “My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.”The case prosecutors have laid out centers on a college consultant, William Singer, whom Ms. Huffman and the other parents hired to guide them through the application process. According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer specialized in boosting students’ chances through fraud: He bribed test administrators to allow cheating on college entrance exams and bribed college coaches to designate his clients’ children as recruits to teams for which they were not actually qualified. Mr. Singer cooperated with prosecutors and has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.A total of 33 parents were charged in the case. Some have made clear they will fight the charges, while others may still be debating what to do. Ms. Huffman is the highest-profile parent to admit wrongdoing in the case so far.The actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were also charged and were not among those who prosecutors said on Monday would plead guilty. The government has said that the couple conspired with Mr. Singer to pay $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women’s crew team, even though neither actually rowed crew. Ms. Loughlin has lost some professional opportunities as a result of the charges — most notably, the Hallmark Channel said that it would stop development of shows that feature her.It is not clear what impact Ms. Huffman’s acknowledgment of guilt will have on her career. She has roles in several coming movies and television series, including playing the prosecutor Linda Fairstein in the mini-series “When They See Us” about the so-called Central Park Five, five black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park in 1989.Prosecutors said that Ms. Huffman and most of the other parents would plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but it is unclear how much time, if any, Ms. Huffman and the other parents will receive.Their sentences may be affected in part by how much money each is alleged to have paid to Mr. Singer and others as part of the scheme. Ms. Huffman’s payment of $15,000 was among the smallest, according to court documents. Ms. Huffman’s and the 12 other parents’ sentences are also likely to be lighter as a result of their pleading guilty and not making the government go to trial.In addition to the parents, prosecutors said on Monday that one of several coaches charged in the case, Michael Center, the former head coach of men’s tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, would also plead guilty to the same crime. Prosecutors said that Mr. Singer paid Mr. Center $60,000 in cash and directed $40,000 to the University of Texas tennis program in exchange for Mr. Center designating the son of one of Mr. Singer’s clients as a recruit for the tennis team, even though he was not a competitive tennis player and did not ultimately play on the team.Two parents, Bruce and Davina Isackson of Hillsborough, Calif., have also agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said. The Isacksons were accused of paying Mr. Singer $600,000 to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their two daughters’ admission to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. as athletic recruits, and to cheat on their younger daughter’s ACT.According to the criminal complaint against Ms. Huffman, her husband, William H. Macy, was also involved in the $15,000 payment to Mr. Singer. For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Macy was not charged.The number of students who have been punished as a result of the investigation is also growing. Last week, Stanford announced that it had expelled a student who had falsely claimed in her application to be a competitive sailor and had vacated the credits that she had already accumulated. The student’s name has not been made public. The former Stanford sailing coach, John Vandemoer, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and has acknowledged accepting donations to his sailing program from Mr. Singer in exchange for agreeing to use recruiting slots for Mr. Singer’s clients.The student whom Stanford expelled, the daughter of a client of Mr. Singer’s, was not actually recruited as a sailor, but after she was admitted, Mr. Singer directed $500,000 to Stanford’s sailing program."
"12 People, Including 6 Coaches, Plead Not Guilty in College Admissions Scandal - The New York Times
BOSTON — A tennis coach with a country club membership and a second home on Cape Cod. An assistant teacher at a Houston public high school. A college administrator whose reputation as a stickler for the rules belied what prosecutors say was a penchant for secretly taking bribes to facilitate students’ admission.All together, a dozen people, including six coaches, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Boston on Monday in the college admissions scandal that has ensnared Hollywood celebrities and forced a reckoning at elite colleges where prosecutors say students were admitted on the basis of falsified test scores and athletic credentials.Those who appeared in court showcased the wide range of people who prosecutors believe were caught up in the scheme. The man who connected them all was William Singer, a college admissions consultant known as Rick who has pleaded guilty to helping the children of clients cheat on college admissions exams and to facilitating bribes.So far, the prosecutors have revealed little beyond what is in the charging documents, leaving several mysteries. The United States attorney’s office has said that the investigation is continuing, leading to speculation that more parents or coaches could be charged.At a news conference on March 12, Andrew E. Lelling, the United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said that one client of Mr. Singer’s had paid $6.5 million to facilitate their child’s admission to college — many times more than what any of the other parents have been accused of paying. This payment is not mentioned in any of the documents, and the person who paid this sum has not been revealed. A spokeswoman for the attorney’s office would not identify the family or the school, but said it was paid to get a child into college through the athletic recruiting scheme.Also on Monday, the federal Department of Education sent letters to the eight colleges where coaches are alleged to have taken bribes, saying that it was opening an investigation of its own, according to a department official with knowledge of the investigation.The letter said that the investigation, first reported by Politico, would examine, among other things, whether the colleges violated any laws or regulations governing federal financial aid programs. It asked the colleges for information about their admissions policies, as well as the names, Social Security numbers and academic transcripts of students who were allegedly admitted as part of the scheme.Those who appeared in court in Boston on Monday, all of whom have been indicted on one count of racketeering conspiracy, are each accused of participating in one or both aspects of the scam.At one end of the spectrum of those charged was Gordon Ernst, the former head tennis coach at Georgetown University, who has been accused of taking $2.7 million in bribes from Mr. Singer to designate at least 12 applicants as recruits to the tennis team. Prosecutors are seeking forfeiture of Mr. Ernst’s country club membership and a second home on Cape Cod, among other assets. Mr. Ernst appeared in court on Monday flanked by two prominent defense lawyers.At the other end was Lisa Williams, an assistant teacher at a Houston high school known as Niki who prosecutors say took bribes — the indictment cites one in the amount of $5,000 — in exchange for allowing cheating on the college entrance exams. The judge noted that Ms. Williams, who entered her plea in a voice barely above a whisper, had qualified for a court-appointed lawyer.In a sign of the wide interest the case has generated, television cameras and photographers crowded the sidewalk outside the courthouse an hour before the hearing. Access to the courtroom was limited, with some journalists confined to a spillover room. Inside the courtroom, the defendants, their lawyers and family members, and a few members of the public, filled the benches on the left and in the center, while the benches on the right were packed with reporters.Most of the defendants appeared in suits, but one charged in connection with test cheating, Igor Dvorskiy, the director of a private school in Los Angeles, was dressed informally, in a gray sweater.Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley conducted the hearing with the efficiency of an assembly line. She brought the defendants up three at a time to be arraigned. Mr. Ernst came first, and in addressing him about his rights and the consequences of violating the conditions of his release, Judge Kelley instructed the others to listen carefully so that she did not have to repeat herself.All of the defendants are out on bail, of varying amounts. Those who also appeared on Monday were Donna Heinel, the former senior associate athletic director at the University of Southern California; Laura Janke and Ali Khosroshahin, former University of Southern California soccer coaches; William Ferguson, the former women’s volleyball coach at Wake Forest University; Jorge Salcedo, the former head coach of men’s soccer at the University of California at Los Angeles; and Jovan Vavic, the former U.S.C. water polo coach.Others included Steven Masera, the accountant and chief financial officer of Mr. Singer’s company and a related nonprofit through which prosecutors say he funneled the bribes; Mikaela Sanford, an employee of Mr. Singer’s who is accused of taking online classes in place of some students so that they could submit the grades she earned as part of their college applications; and Martin Fox, the president of a private tennis academy in Houston, whom prosecutors say Mr. Singer paid for helping to arrange some of the bribes.Mr. Ferguson is accused of taking a bribe of $100,000 in exchange for designating the daughter of one of Mr. Singer’s clients, who had previously applied to Wake Forest and had been wait-listed, as a recruit for the volleyball team.His lawyer, Shaun Clarke, said outside the courthouse that his client was not guilty and would fight the charges.“No one — no one — was admitted to Wake Forest who didn’t earn it, as a student and as an athlete,” Mr. Clarke said. “Bill Ferguson does not belong in this indictment.”More hearings, with other defendants in the case, are scheduled for later this week. In an indication of how high a priority the case is for the office, Mr. Lelling, the United States attorney, attended part of the hearing on Monday."

"Fed Cup: Madison Keys Rolls, Pulling U.S. Into Tie With Australia - The New York Times
Madison Keys kept the United States from being in a big hole against Australia by routing Kimberly Birrell, 6-2, 6-2, on Saturday in the Fed Cup quarterfinals in Asheville, N.C.Keys’s victory came after Ashleigh Barty posted a 6-1, 7-6 (2) victory over Sofia Kenin earlier in the day. Keys and Barty will square off Sunday with the best-of-five matches tied, 1-1.Avoiding an 0-2 deficit was crucial for the United States, which lost to the Czech Republic in last year’s final.“We’ll take it one match at a time,” the American captain, Kathy Rinaldi, said afterward. “That’s what we’ve been doing since I’ve been captain. That’s what we’re going to continue to do.”The Czech Republic split two matches against visiting Romania. Simona Halep -of Romania rolled past Katerina Siniakova, 6-4, 6-0, and will face Karolina Pliskova on Sunday. Pliskova earned a 6-1, 6-4 win over Mihaela Buzarnescu but has struggled against Halep, who has a 6-2 lead in their head-to-head meetings.“Six-two is fine — the match starts from zero-zero, so there’s going to be a chance for both of us, never mind what happened in the past,” Pliskova said. “I just have it in my head that I beat her when we won,” against Romania in the 2016 Fed Cup quarterfinals.France took a 2-0 lead over host Belgium as Caroline Garcia defeated Alison Van Uytvanck, 7-6 (2), 4-6, 6-2, and Alizé Cornet dispatched Elise Mertens, 7-6 (6), 6-2.Belarus owns a 2-0 lead over host Germany after Aliaksandra Sasnovich defeated Tatjana Maria, 7-6 (3), 6-3, and Aryna Sabalenka soared past Andrea Petkovic, 6-2, 6-1. The winner will take on the United States or Australia."

Sign up to get it by email.___I’m in Hong Kong this week for our annual meeting with New York Times editors and correspondents from all across Asia, and on the plane over I was reading Evan Osnos’s book, “Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China.”It’s a fascinating read, far more about people than geopolitics (read our 2014 review), making it a strong introduction to some of the themes that many of us will continue to inquire about as the world grapples with China’s growing impact.Some of the questions are almost existential: Has China proved that centralized authoritarianism works better for economic growth than decentralized democracy?Others are more particular: How is China using technology to maintain and expand its power? How will China respond to the growing backlash to its policies forming in Australia, the United States and elsewhere?These reporting targets, we hope, will yield interesting journalism throughout the year.But our discussions in Hong Kong also covered the region. We have correspondents throughout Asia, reporting on politics, culture, business and technology; here are a few of the topics that led to robust conversations about our future coverage.This is far from a comprehensive list, but consider it a bit of a preview for 2019.Elections: India, the Philippines, Thailand — and Australia of course — all have elections scheduled for this year. Voters will be given stark choices about not just domestic policy, but also foreign affairs.Demographics: India has to create a million jobs each year to keep unemployment from rising; Japan is desperate for workers; China is desperate for babies. There are also intriguing stories about South Korea’s aging populace, Australia’s immigration debate and China’s broader population dynamics — especially its overabundance of men.Women: The role of women in the work force and in life, in Japan, in China, in Australia — these were all of interest to the group. What are the structures that maintain the status quo, how do they differ from country to country, and to what extent are they changing?Trump’s world: Ah, the Americans — what an unpredictable lot! What many of us in the Indo-Pacific wanted to know is what the broader shift toward “America first” means for the world. To what extent will the American relationship with South Korea and North Korea change? To what extent will the United States-China trade war undermine the global economy or create new relationships and alliances?These are just a few of the subjects you’ll see explored in The New York Times this year — and of course, in this newsletter, which aims to add a bit of perspective on Australia and the topics Australians care about.Sign up to get it in your inbox each week if you haven’t already, and join us in our NYT Australia Facebook group for additional discussion.Now here are a few of the stories that stood out for me this week, from Australia, Vanuatu and beyond.___“A faint aura of destiny seems to hover over Teouma Bay,” writes Gideon Lewis-Kraus, in this ambitious magazine story told from Vanuatu about old bones that have led to sweeping claims about human history and settlement throughout the Pacific.Gideon brilliantly explains both the controversial science that’s transforming archaeology — and the risks that come from the perception of scientific certainty about ancient history.If you read just one long story this week, read this one.For those seeking a shorter way in, here are 5 takeaways from his report.___Following Brexit’s ups and downs can be exhausting. For context, read this news analysis piece that explains how the Brexit fiasco “seems to be forcing a tectonic shift in how Britain is governed, as Parliament flexes its muscles and the prime minister struggles to force through her agenda — a dynamic more characteristic of America’s gridlock-prone system.”You might also want to check out our graphic on what happens next (or at least what might happen next; certaintly eludes us all).___Sometimes global failure can be so... visually stunning.Seriously. Check out this stunning exploration of the world’s disappearing glaciers.They cover about 200,000 square miles of the earth’s surface and over the last four decades they’ve lost the equivalent of a layer of ice 70 feet thick.This great global melting contributes to sea level rise. It affects production of hydroelectricity. It leads to disasters like rapid, catastrophic floods and debris flows. It alters rivers and ecosystems, affecting the organisms that inhabit them.___We have several reporters at the Australian Open.

"From Architecture to Jewelry Design - The New York Times
NAME Rosa Van ParysAGE 42HOMETOWN Quito, EcuadorNOW LIVES In Westlake Village in Southern California, with her husband and business partner, Michael Van Parys, and their two children.BACKGROUND When Ms. Van Parys was growing up, her father, the Ecuadorean journalist and novelist Diego Cornejo Menacho, prized education above all else. “My dad always said, ‘I’m giving you the gift of education so you can support yourself, and never depend on anybody,’” she said. After high school, Ms. Van Parys first went to France, where she studied graphic and plastic arts, then returned to Ecuador to earn a professional degree in architecture.Over the next five years, she picked up a master’s in building science from the University of Southern California School of Architecture (where she met her husband) and a master’s in design from Harvard. In 2012, the couple opened a boutique firm, Van Parys Architecture & Design, focusing on residential projects in upscale Southern California enclaves like Malibu and Newport Beach.At their studio, they maintain a library of deluxe materials such as malachite, lapis and agate tiles for countertops; gold leaf for faux wall finishes; and lighting made from onyx and alabaster — elements that helped bridge Ms. Van Parys’s path to jewelry making.DESIGNING WOMAN In 2016, Ms. Van Parys decided it was time to upgrade the bead and silver jewelry she’d been making for fun. Her first high-end design, a multichain white gold necklace, incorporated three emerald-cut aquamarines that once belonged to her grandmother. “Jewelry was not supposed to be a business,” she said, smiling ruefully. “I thought it was going to be my stress reliever.”While navigating the jewelry business has been tricky (“We don’t have unlimited funds for P.R. and consignment,” Ms. Van Parys said), translating her interior design aesthetic into décor for the body has come naturally. “We had no training in jewelry, but when you’re an architect, you’re a problem solver,” she said. “Your eye is drawn to good materials. I know when a stone is amazing.”CURRENT PROJECT Ms. Van Parys’s designs are by turns sassy and sophisticated, with recurring motifs that include interlocking circles, pavé-studded disco balls, skulls blazing with gem-set eyes and spiky 18-karat gold cones set against organic white South Sea and black Tahitian pearls. “I just love the edge,” she said.An avid tennis player, Ms. Van Parys recently created a series of luxe tennis ball and racket pendants in 18-karat gold and diamonds. Her collection is also rife with animal imagery, such as a pink gold anaconda statement ring lavished with graduated pink sapphires, and a panther head pendant of yellow sapphires set atop a pair of golden crossbones.COSTLY ENDEAVOR Explaining pricing to clients and potential wholesale partners is one of Ms. Van Parys’s biggest challenges. “Bracelets with pavé beads range from $3,000 to $11,000,” she said. “Some people say it’s hard to justify the expense for a tiny little piece.

In what the Justice Department called its largest ever college admissions prosecution, federal authorities charged 50 people on Tuesday with taking part in a nationwide scheme to game the admissions process at highly competitive schools like Yale and the University of Southern California. [The college admissions scandal has raised a lot of questions. We’ve answered them here.]Those charged include wealthy and powerful parents accused of paying millions of dollars in bribes, exam administrators and athletic coaches accused of manufacturing students’ achievements, and private admissions counselors accused of coordinating it all. At the center of the scandal are the Edge College & Career Network, also known as the Key, and a nonprofit organization, the Key Worldwide Foundation, that prosecutors say effectively were a single enterprise. They are accused of helping students cheat on standardized tests, and paying bribes to athletic coaches who could get the students into college using fake athletic credentials. [Read more on the Justice Department’s largest ever college admissions prosecution.][Read more about how the F.B.I. says parents cheated to get their children into elite colleges.]Federal prosecutors accused dozens of parents of paying millions of dollars in bribes to help their children secure spots at prestigious American universities.

"Australia’s Old and New Spending Spree? - The New York Times
 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email.___The gridlock of the government shutdown in Washington has me thinking this week about money and government in Australia.In the United States at the moment, just paying government workers is an epic challenge; here’s the latest on failed attempts to end the impasse in Washington.In Australia, however, I’m often struck by the never-ending flurry of new funding announcements for so many things deemed vital by officials.Y’all are rich, as some Americans might say, and profligate — especially with an election on the way.Just this week, Scott Morrison proudly declared that Australia would spend more than A$12 million ($8.5 million) to mark the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook’s first voyage to Australia. That includes A$6.7 million for having a replica of Captain Cook’s ship, the Endeavour, circumnavigate Australia with stops at 39 locations.And that comes on top of big spending elsewhere.Money to memorialize the past (in glossy romanticized form) is plentiful. You probably heard about the A$500 million gift to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, to upgrade the monument with a bit of recent military history.But that’s on top of another A$100 million set aside for the Sir John Monash Centre in France, along with A$12.7m for official histories of Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor.The War Memorial windfall is the one drawing the most scrutiny; how the money will be spent is still something of a mystery. Lots of planes and tanks seems to be part of it.The rest? Well, good luck: Secrecy, it seems, is another common theme.Perhaps because this is year 27 of uninterrupted economic growth, public money is sometimes treated like a toy for political toddlers (the ferry-naming contest that briefly yielded Ferry McFerryface comes to mind) and demands for details tend to produce answers only after the cash is spent.This was also the week, for example, when the Great Barrier Reef Foundation announced its first project since it received A$443 million from the government last year. That’s a giant pool of money. It was doled out at record speed, with barely any oversight and no competitive bidding.And the foundation’s first project — setting aside A$574,000 to finance a survey of remote parts of the Great Barrier Reef — has done little to douse the flames of outrage. It came on the heels of an audit that found the administration costs associated with the A$443 million grant could be as high as A$86.4 million.But it would be a mistake to look only at the winners.Even a wealthy country still has to make choices so to make sure I wasn’t overly distracted by all that generosity, I looked around a bit for what’s being cut.The first thing I noticed was the value of scrutinizing spending in context.Both the Liberal and Labor leadership scrambled this week to take credit for a A$60 million hospital expansion plan in Cairns, but that increase looks less impressive when you consider that the government — with Mr. Morrison as treasurer — shifted more of the health care burden to states in what Labor sometimes describes as a A$715 million cut for Australia’s public hospitals from 2017-2020.The second and more obvious thing that jumped out at me: cuts to higher education.This was already on my radar — many of our stories have examined Australia’s dependence on full-fee-paying foreign students — but the numbers are staggering.In December 2017, the federal government announced it would cut A$2.2bn from universities, mostly through a two-year freeze in grants funding.Then last month, universities were hit with another round of research funding cuts — A$328.5 million reduction over the next four years.Quality education is never just about money. And in comparison to higher education costs in many other countries, especially the United States, Australia is still a bargain for students.But when spending outlays and spending cuts are thrown together, you start to wonder: Is it fair to say that Australia’s government is choosing to spend money on a Disneyfied version of British settlement rather than on actual academic research?Perhaps not. The dollar amounts differ and there are all kinds of examples I’ve left out of my cursory analysis.And yet, the old journalistic adage borne of Watergate — you know the one, “follow the money” — still rings true in many ways and many places, including Australia.Yes, for my colleagues in Washington, that simple phrase has a different connotation. Right now it means covering how government workers are surviving without paychecks. It also conjures up images of Robert Mueller and his investigation into President Trump and Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In Australia too, though, it’s worth looking past the announcements promoting dollar signs and grants. If and when a recession does come, and there are signs that it’s around the corner, there will be a lot of questions to be answered about priorities.Now for a few reads of the week.P.S.

"Actress Felicity Huffman, 13 Others to Plead Guilty in U.S. College Admissions Scandal - The New York Times
BOSTON — Actress Felicity Huffman and 13 other people have agreed to plead guilty to participating in what prosecutors call the largest college admissions scam uncovered in U.S. history, federal prosecutors said on Monday.The 14 are among 50 people, including wealthy parents and college team coaches, accused by federal prosecutors in Boston of engaging in schemes that involved cheating on college entrance exams and paying $25 million in bribes to secure their children admission at well-known universities.Huffman, who starred in ""Desperate Housewives,"" was among 33 parents charged in March with participating in the scheme in hopes of getting their children into universities including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California.Prosecutors, as part of a plea deal, agreed to recommend a prison term at the ""low end"" of the four to 10 months Huffman faces under federal sentencing guidelines. She also agreed to pay a $20,000 fine and restitution.Huffman, who is married to the actor William H. Macy, in a statement on Monday said she was ""ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community.""""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her,"" the former best actress Oscar nominee said.Authorities say the scheme was overseen by California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, who has pleaded guilty to facilitating the cheating scam and bribing coaches to present the parents' children as fake athletic recruits.Prosecutors said Huffman, 56, made a $15,000 contribution to Singer's foundation in exchange for having an associate of Singer's in 2017 secretly correct her daughter's answers on an SAT college entrance exam at a test center Singer controlled.Twelve other parents have agreed to plead guilty, including California marketing executive Jane Buckingham and Agustin Huneeus, who owned a California wine company.Two of the parents, including Gordon Caplan, the former co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, last week themselves disclosed they had reached plea deals.Two parents who agreed to plead guilty, Bruce Isackson, president of a California real estate development firm, and his wife, Davina Isackson, have also agreed to cooperate in the ongoing investigation.Additionally, Michael Center, the former head coach of men's tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, has agreed to plead guilty to a conspiracy charge related to bribes he accepted to designate a child as a recruit.

"Art Collecting Is in His Blood - The New York Times
LONDON — Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza comes from one of Europe’s most famous art-collecting families: A museum in Madrid bears his family name. That institution, the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza opened in 1992, when Spain bought the family’s collection of works by masters including Dürer, Caravaggio, Rubens, Monet and van Gogh. The collection, said to have been rivaled in Europe by only that of the queen of England, was established by a dynasty of industrialists who made a fortune in shipbuilding, coal, steel and iron.Mr. Thyssen-Bornemisza, 55, a collector of Roman coins and antiquities, opened the Kallos Gallery in London’s upscale Mayfair district in 2014 and specializes in Greek but also Roman, Egyptian and Near Eastern antiquities. Having been offered a small stand in the Showcase sidebar section of Tefaf Maastricht last year, Kallos is this year making its debut as a full-fledged exhibitor and will be showing items including a marble portrait head of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and an Egyptian alabaster canopic jar that once contained the organs of a high-ranking priest, removed during mummification.The following conversation has been edited and condensed.What is it like to show at Maastricht?It’s the gold standard — the best fair in the world. Typically, most dealers make over 50 percent of their annual turnover in their 10 days at Maastricht. Everybody hoards their best pieces for Maastricht, and that’s what we’ve done.How did the family collection come about?The collection started because my great-grandfather, who was a successful entrepreneur and not from a noble family, absolutely adored [the French sculptor Auguste] Rodin’s work and commissioned six pieces. He then went on to build up the old master collection. My grandfather continued the collection and took it up to about the 18th century. His famous directive to my father was: “You can collect up to the 18th century, but the 19th century is suspect, and the 20th century is rubbish.”My father, who clearly had very different tastes, was undeterred by this advice and started collecting German Expressionist paintings, which were at the time considered not great art.He then bought Cézanne, Matisse, van Gogh and the famous Gauguin “Mata Mua.” He loved Cubist paintings, loved Picasso, loved Braque. And in the ’70s, he fell in love with American 19th-century landscapes.At the time, there were only a handful of private collectors. The market wasn’t anything like what it became by the ’80s.What was it like growing up in the middle of all these masterpieces?When a painting arrived in [the Swiss family villa in] Lugano, my father was like a little boy at Christmas, unwrapping a painting and deciding where it would hang. His favorite paintings were actually in his bedroom: He had a late van Gogh, a Cézanne, a Degas. You can’t grow up in that environment and be indifferent to such beauty.My father never explained why he liked a particular painting, with one exception, which was a modern painting of a triangle. I asked him once, and he said, “There’s a great tension within this piece.” I left it at that.Why didn’t you collect paintings, too?As my elder brother, a keen tennis player, once said, “Just because you’re a keen tennis player doesn’t mean you want to step onto the court with Roger Federer.”Were you eager to mark yourself off from your father and grandfather?Yes, that’s right. I believe that you should collect what you love in life.I always had a great passion for ancient history, for Rome. Since I was a little boy, I collected coins. I happened to be in a hotel in Geneva once when there was a big Roman coin auction. I remember going to the viewing and seeing the most extraordinary examples of Roman coinage, and I got hooked. There was an open window in the market, where I was able to go in and buy the best pieces.I have hundreds and hundreds of coins. I do it the old-fashioned way: I write out cards with the descriptions and weights. The more coins you look at, the better you get. The difference between something that’s good and something that’s exceptional, you can only learn over time.Why open an antiquities gallery?As I was buying at auction about 10 years ago, there were some Greek pieces coming up that were exceptional. Antiquities is a strange area, because you’ve got maybe a dozen big collectors in the market. There was nobody trying to build up the world’s greatest collection of Greek antiquities.I bought these pieces and thought it would be great to open a gallery at the top end of the market for Greek antiquities.I was driven by my passion as a collector. I didn’t open this gallery as a business venture.But galleries are shutting down right, left and center?You’re absolutely right. If you have a gallery in New York, London or Geneva, it’s a very expensive proposition. Rents are sky high.A lot of antiquities dealers don’t have gallery premises and still make a good living. But they’re people who have established their reputations over decades and have particular skills: They’re great bronze experts, or vase experts. If you’re new to the game and trying to build up a brand, having a gallery is important.Where do you want to go with your own collection?I believe that private collectors should open their collections to the public and to the academic community. Otherwise, it becomes a selfish exercise.I have two pieces on loan to the Ashmolean Museum [in Oxford] at the moment.Obviously my intention in the long term would be to open a small museum somewhere, perhaps in London. That would be my endgame."

"Andy Murray Loses at Australian Open but Won’t Say It’s All Over - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — With the end in sight, the capacity crowd inside Melbourne Arena rose to its feet. Andy Murray soaked in their ovation, and their emotions, and then began to let his out.As his first-round match at the Australian Open reached the four-hour mark Monday evening, Murray was trailing his Spanish opponent, Roberto Bautista Agut, by 1-5 in the fifth. His time, he knew, was almost up.Murray had battled valiantly to force that final set, coming back after losing the first two to level the match. He even had looked — briefly — as if he might take command of the fifth set as well before Bautista Agut reeled off five straight games, putting a comeback well out of Murray’s reach.So when the crowd rose to salute him, Murray, tears visible in his eyes, raised his right arm to acknowledge the applause, seeming to accept the fond farewell and his fate. But he was not quite done: He saved one match point and held serve, delaying the inevitable by one game, buying himself a fragment of time.Bautista Agut, the No. 22 seed, served out his victory one game later, closing out a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-2 result after 4 hours 9 minutes.It was the longest match of the first day of the Australian Open, and a fine representation of a dogged career that may be ending soon.Murray, a three-time Grand Slam champion whose ranking has slipped to 229th, has been slowed by a hip injury for more than a year. He said in his pretournament news conference on Friday that he had set Wimbledon this year as his “end point,” and that he could not rule out that this tournament might be his last.“If this was my last match, an amazing way to end,” Murray said in an on-court interview. “I gave literally everything I had.”Murray had made the match more competitive than many expected; while he has been hobbled, Bautista Agut won an ATP tournament in Doha, Qatar, eight days ago. Though his movement was visibly encumbered at times, Murray maintained many of his other gifts, and fought his way through several long rallies with his signature drop shots, giving a crowd that included his mother, Judy, and brother, Jamie, plenty to cheer.“Today I knew it was potentially the last match I play; I don’t care if I damage my hip anymore in the match,” Murray said, “so it’s a bit easier to deal with the pain because I know that I don’t have to hit balls tomorrow.”By the time Murray had joined his former coach Mark Petchey for an on-court interview, his raw emotions seemed to have settled, which almost seemed to catch him off guard.“Actually,” he said, “I think I’m going to be all right.”Despite the finality of his remarks on Friday, and despite the eulogies for his career that had been shared in the days since — including a tribute video from other top players that played as he stood on the court Monday night — Murray left the door open to a return.“I don’t know — maybe I’ll see you again,” he said, drawing cheers from the crowd. “I’ll do everything possible to try. If I want to go again, I’ll need to have a big operation, which there’s no guarantees I’ll be able to come back from anyway. But I’ll give it my best shot.”Murray was referring to a hip resurfacing operation like the one that the doubles player Bob Bryan underwent last year; Bryan is trying to come back this season. In his postmatch news conference, Murray said that he would decide soon between struggling through months of further pain without surgery in order to play Wimbledon as a last hurrah, or to have the surgery with an eye on continuing his career after rehabilitation.Murray said he thought he would make his decision “in the next week or so.”“If I go ahead with the operation and I don’t recover well from it, then I don’t play again — I’m aware of that,” he said. “That is the decision that I have to make. It will improve my quality of life; I’ll be in less pain doing just normal things like walking around and putting your shoes and socks on and things. Just now, going to walk my dogs, playing football with my friends, is like the worst thing I can think of doing. Like, I hate it, because it’s so sore and it’s uncomfortable.”Those cold realities probably will sink in for Murray soon after he leaves Melbourne. But he said he would be O.K. if Monday’s loss was his final match.“If today was my last match, look: it was a brilliant way to finish,” he said. “That’s something that I’ll probably take into consideration, as well. It was an amazing atmosphere. I literally gave everything that I had on the court, fought as best as I could, and performed a lot better than what I should have done without the amount I’ve been able to practice and train.”Murray is known for his indefatigable work ethic, so settling for the less painful option has never been his strong suit.“It’s also been a flaw of mine,” he said. “Some people might say, ‘It’s a positive thing that Andy worked really, really hard, such and such, trained hard.’ But I also often didn’t stop myself when I was being told to do things. I should have sometimes said, ‘No, I’m not doing that today.’ Or: ‘No, I don’t want to train today. I’m sore, I need a day off.’ I didn’t do that. I would always kind of just go along with what I was being told. That was a mistake.”"
"Serena Williams Could Face Top Seed Early at the Australian Open - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams could face a fourth-round match against top-seeded Simona Halep, or perhaps her sister Venus, in the Australian Open, which begins on Monday.Williams, who is seeded 16th and seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title, will play her first match on Tuesday against 71st-ranked Tatjana Maria, a neighbor of hers in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. In the second round, she could face the 2014 Wimbledon runner-up, Eugenie Bouchard.Venus Williams could be Halep’s third-round opponent, meaning the Williams sisters could face off in the fourth round. The last time they faced each other in Melbourne was in the 2017 final, which Serena won, 6-4, 6-4, while two months pregnant. Serena Williams has not played the Australian Open since then.As she seeks a second Grand Slam title, Halep will first have to make the best of a second chance.At the draw ceremony on Thursday evening, Halep drew Kaia Kanepi for a first-round match for the second consecutive Grand Slam event.In the opening match of the 2018 United States Open, Kanepi decisively blasted the top-seeded Halep off the court, winning, 6-2, 6-4, and sending shock waves through the tournament in its first hours.Though she has maintained the No. 1 ranking she consolidated by winning last year’s French Open, Halep has not won a match since her loss to Kanepi more than four months ago, running up a five-match losing streak as she struggled with a back injury. She lost her only match of this year, to 15th-ranked Ashleigh Barty in Sydney on Wednesday. Halep also does not have a coach after splitting with Darren Cahill in the off-season.An Estonian veteran capable of overpowering Halep’s world-class defense, Kanepi is ranked 70th but has reached the third round or better at her last three Grand Slam events on hardcourts. After beating Halep, she reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open last year, and took a set off the eventual finalist Serena Williams before losing in three.Seventh-seeded Karolina Pliskova, who won the WTA tournament in Brisbane on Sunday, looms as a quarterfinal opponent in that top quarter of the draw.Fourth-seeded Naomi Osaka, who beat Serena Williams in the final of the U.S. Open last year, is also in the top half of the draw. Osaka could face the two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka in the third round.The bottom half of the women’s draw is anchored by second-seeded Angelique Kerber, last year’s Wimbledon champion. She could face fifth-seeded Sloane Stephens in the quarterfinals. Stephens opens against her fellow American Taylor Townsend, who was the 2012 Australian Open junior champion.The defending women’s champion, Caroline Wozniacki, seeded third, is also in the bottom half of the draw. She could face 30th-seeded Maria Sharapova, the 2008 champion, in the third round, and Barty, the highest-ranked Australian in either draw, in the fourth round. Big hitters like No. 8 Petra Kvitova and No. 11 Aryna Sabalenka are also possible quarterfinal opponents.In men’s singles, third-seeded Roger Federer, seeking a third consecutive title, was drawn into the bottom half of the draw with second-seeded Rafael Nadal. They could meet in the semifinals.Federer’s road there will not be easy. He opens against 99th-ranked Denis Istomin. He could face 14th-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth round, and sixth-seeded Marin Cilic or 10th-seeded Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals.Nadal has struggled with his durability on hardcourts, completing only one of the 12 tournaments he entered on the surface last year before withdrawing or retiring from a match. Nadal received a comfortable opening-round match; he will face 238th-ranked James Duckworth, an Australian wild card.Nadal could face fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson or ninth-seeded John Isner in the quarterfinals. Isner faces a rare challenge in his first round: an opponent taller than he is. The 6-foot-10 Isner will face Reilly Opelka, a 21-year-old from Michigan who breaks the seven-foot barrier.In the top half, top-seeded Novak Djokovic, who won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year, opens against a qualifier and could face the wild card Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. Djokovic, who is seeking his seventh Australian Open title, beat Tsonga for his first in the 2008 final. In the quarterfinals, Djokovic could face eighth-seeded Kei Nishikori, who won the ATP event in Brisbane on Sunday for his first title in three years.The only other Grand Slam champion in the top half of the draw with Djokovic is unseeded Stan Wawrinka, who opens against Ernests Gulbis and could face 16th-seeded Milos Raonic or Nick Kyrgios in the second round. Those players are in the quarter of the draw anchored by fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev, who was the champion of the year-end ATP Finals in London last year and who has yet to reach the semifinal of a Grand Slam."

"Trump Returns This Weekend to Mar-a-Lago, His Gilded Comfort Zone - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — After two months spent scorching the earth in Washington and complaining about being cooped up in the White House, President Trump is planning to return this weekend to the one place where he knows he will receive a hero’s welcome for his troubles: Mar-a-Lago, his gilded club by the sea in Palm Beach.“You would have to be insensitive not to be touched by how he has stayed there working,” said Toni Holt Kramer, the founder of Trumpettes USA, a booster group that is planning to welcome him. “I think people will have tears in their eyes because they’re so grateful that he’s come back to his home away from home.”Mr. Trump made a point of staying in Washington over the Christmas holidays — waiting, he said, for Democrats to negotiate with him on funding for a border wall — so it will be the president’s first visit to Mar-a-Lago since Thanksgiving.It will not be a complete escape — he still has no deal on the wall and a State of the Union address to give on Tuesday. But after his arrival on Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump is expected to do many of the things he always does when he is at Mar-a-Lago: dining at the owner’s table on the patio; spending the afternoon at Trump International Golf Club, about a 15-minute motorcade drive away; and never venturing anywhere in Palm Beach outside his own two properties.The first lady, Melania Trump, will travel there with him this weekend, her spokeswoman said, though Mrs. Trump tends to keep a low profile while at the resort.In the Mar-a-Lago cocoon, the president is in his most comfortable mode, friends and allies say: playing the jocular host in front of an adoring crowd.On Saturday, P.J. Schrantz, who founded Veleve, a charity that provides support for veterans, is betting on Mr. Trump to make an appearance at a $600-a-plate fund-raiser his organization is hosting in one of the club’s ballrooms. And plans for Mr. Trump’s annual Super Bowl viewing party at his golf club on Sunday evening, complete with a steak and lobster buffet, are still on.“I chose to have it there because I’ve attended galas there,” Mr. Schrantz said of his event, which will feature a George Michael tribute artist donating his time, as well as honor the astronaut Buzz Aldrin. “The members are such giving people that we could raise a couple of million dollars in an evening.”Some Mar-a-Lago members say they are already wistful about the blissful weeks without tangled traffic and increased security — a seven-minute drive from home to the club takes at least 30 minutes when Mr. Trump is in town, one said — but many will brave the roads for the chance to participate in a presidential selfie or a similar show of support.Laurence Leamer, a longtime Palm Beach resident who has known Mr. Trump since the 1990s and is the author of “Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump’s Presidential Palace,” said in an interview that even if people had an issue with the president’s policymaking, the meatloaf recipe or anything in between, they tended to keep it to themselves.“People have been trained to have like a Pavlovian reaction or something,” Mr. Leamer said. “You’re supposed to say things are great. When he asks you, ‘How are things?’ you’re not supposed to complain.”Just as the Trump International Hotel in Washington has become a safe space for the president and his supporters, Mar-a-Lago is a 20-acre oasis for those who adore all things Trump, from his zero-tolerance immigration policies to the menu items named after his children.The focus on Mr. Trump has grown to the point where some Democratic members, who have loved the club’s amenities for decades, have recently rescinded their memberships because they do not feel comfortable there anymore.“There’s a political angle to being a member now,” said Cynthia Friedman, a Democratic fund-raiser who joined the club 24 years ago and recalls playing tennis on Saturdays with Marla Maples, Mr. Trump’s second wife. “There are a lot of people who I don’t recognize. They’re not the people I used to play tennis with. Things change, and it’s time to move on.”In December, instead of sending her $1,600 in monthly dues, she joined the Beach Club, a rival members-only club, on the other side of town.But Ms. Friedman is still in the minority. Many Mar-a-Lago members book reservations weeks in advance to be in the same room with the president. And Trumpworld celebrities, like Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director; the president’s son Donald Trump Jr.; and Antonio Sabato Jr., the Trump-loving model-turned-politician, have been spotted at social events and fund-raisers in Palm Beach, serving as something of a warm-up act to the main event.Karyn Turk, a business owner and the 2016 winner of the Mrs. Florida beauty pageant, said if the walls looked like they were caving in on the president in Washington, there were only blue skies in Palm Beach.“It’s a lot of hype,” she said of the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III. “I feel like in a lot of ways, it’s still just a witch hunt.”If the “Winter White House” is a boon for the members of Mr. Trump’s exclusive club, and a respite not only for the president but also for the staff members who relocate with him, the annual decampment still raises ethical concerns.The White House has refused to release a list of those who visit the president there. And elsewhere in the Trump Organization orbit, the company said it would introduce new procedures to screen for undocumented immigrants after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump’s flagship New Jersey golf club employed people who had entered the country illegally.And ProPublica reported last summer that three Mar-a-Lago members had amassed an unusual amount of influence in the Department of Veterans Affairs, meddling in agency initiatives and participating in the review of a contract worth some $10 billion.“It certainly seems unprecedented,” said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of the ethics watchdog CREW, “and highly troubling for people to be given significant authority over government matters seemingly primarily on the basis of being paying customers of the president.”The White House has taken at least one informal step to block people who have access to the president’s properties from asking for anything that seems to go too far. Aides have long been on the alert to intercept any notes or policy proposals from overeager supporters — including one from a guest who once helpfully tried to show the president an executive order he had drafted. Mr. Trump has at times directed his aides to give those people ample listening time even if he cannot, according to someone familiar with the process and his thinking.Security around the president may have tightened since 2017, when Mr. Trump sat on the open patio, in front of hundreds of eyeballs and iPhones pointed in his direction, discussing a response to North Korea’s missile test with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. But in many ways, Mr. Trump himself has not changed from the involved club owner he has always been.He has always kept close watch over who comes and goes, and pays close attention to those in the latter category.Jeff Greene, the Palm Beach billionaire who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor of Florida, joined the club when he moved to Palm Beach in 2010. But he quit because, he said, “I have my own tennis court. I never loved going there.”Mr. Trump, he said, took his resignation personally. Sitting next to him at a charity event at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Greene recalled being confronted. “He went right at me, saying, ‘I can’t believe you quit the club.’ He’s figuring someone with plenty of money, why would they care about paying dues for a club?”"

"Brexit, William Barr, Penguins: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times
(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. British lawmakers dealt a crushing defeat to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union.The 432-to-202 vote was the biggest loss in the House of Commons in recent history for a prime minister. The turn of events thrusts Britain into further political chaos just 10 weeks before the country’s scheduled exit from the E.U. Mrs. May above center.The opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn put forward a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May, which Parliament will debate and vote on Wednesday. As things stand, the prime minister must return to Parliament by Monday to present a backup withdrawal plan.If nothing is approved by March 29, Britain will make a “no-deal” exit from the E.U., which lawmakers have warned could be chaotic and pose grave economic risks. Here are some other ways everything could shake out._____2. President Trump’s nominee for attorney general assured senators at his confirmation hearing that he would allow the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to finish the Russia investigation, and promised to withstand any political pressure from the White House.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” William Barr said of the inquiry, which is believed to be in its final stages.With Republicans firmly in control of the Senate, his confirmation to lead the Justice Department appears to be on track.Mr. Barr, who also served as attorney general under President George Bush, is known for his unusually expansive views of executive power. But during the hearing, he qualified some of his beliefs, emphasizing legal limits on the presidency and the independence of law enforcement._____3. House Democrats were a no-show at a White House lunch as both sides continue to search for a compromise to end the government shutdown.The Democrats’ absence was the latest indication that the party is still standing firm against Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Above, demonstrators at a rally organized by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.With the shutdown in its 25th day, the Federal Aviation Administration recalled thousands of furloughed workers to address air safety concerns. (They will work without pay.) And the government closings are weighing heavily on young people caught up in the impasse.From the border, our journalists sent in their latest dispatch as they drive the length of the approximately 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico frontier._____4. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning white supremacy, reflecting anger in both parties over comments by Representative Steve King of Iowa questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.Mr. King, who has a history of making racist remarks and insulting immigrants, was stripped of two House committee seats Monday, after comments he made to The Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”Mr. King, above, took to the House floor to say he would vote in support of the resolution, which called out his remarks specifically. Only one representative voted against it, saying “anything short of a censure” was shallow.Separately, a federal judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. The case will most likely reach the Supreme Court before the printing of census forms begins this summer._____5. Militants attacked a hotel and office complex in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, with a blast and heavy gunfire.At least one person was confirmed killed and 15 wounded in the assault, but the death toll was expected to rise, with some news outlets reporting seven dead. Above, after a blast at the hotel.The assailants were identified as members of the Shabab, an Islamist extremist group with ties to Al Qaeda. The attack came on the eve of a verdict in the trial of three men accused of helping the group in a deadly assault on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi more than five years ago._____6. The most incendiary accusation yet at the El Chapo trial: A witness said the former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto had taken a $100 million bribe from the infamous crime lord.The stunning testimony was delivered in a New York courtroom by Alex Cifuentes Villa, a Colombian pictured above with El Chapo. The two worked closely together from 2007 to 2013, when they were hiding from the authorities in the Sierra Madre mountains. Mr. Cifuentes said Mr. Peña Nieto had reached out around 2012, asking for $250 million to call off the manhunt.There have been hints at high-level corruption since the start of the trial in November, including payoffs from traffickers to the Mexican police and public officials — but no accusations at this level before._____7. When Andy Murray announced he planned to retire from tennis this year, the most distinct voices in the chorus praising him were female.Over more than a decade as a top-10 player, Mr. Murray has used his position to be an advocate for women in tennis in ways large and small. He became the highest-profile men’s player to hire a female coach, and he has made a point of correcting reporters when they omit women from statistics.“Your greatest impact on the world may be yet to come,” the tennis great Billie Jean King wrote on Twitter. “Your voice for equality will inspire future generations.”_____8. When Sphen and Magic became a couple, Australia had just gone through a bitter battle to legalize gay marriage. Suddenly, the country’s biggest animal celebrities were two gay penguins.And after another couple in the colony started neglecting an egg, penguin keepers at the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium figured they would give it to Sphen and Magic.Their chick — called Sphengic — hatched in October and is now waddling around its ice enclosure near the harbor.Our reporter took a look at Sphen and Magic, their courtship, parenting skills and what they mean to Australia._____9. What if the past 15 years in food had never happened?Pete Wells, our chief restaurant critic, found the new Manhattan restaurant Benno proudly out of step with the age — and excellent. Fermented vegetables, foraging and hashtags are all far from the menu. “It’s trying to be delicious,” he writes. “And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception.” Above, duck with foie gras, ras el hanout, turnips and pistachio-date brik at Benno.And the first review is in from our new California restaurant critic, Tejal Rao. She writes about Angler in San Francisco, where the chef is showing how a seafood-rich menu can adapt to the forces of climate change._____10. We end today with a farewell to one of the most recognizable presences in theater.Carol Channing, whose performances in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” and “Hello, Dolly!” made her a Broadway legend, died at the age of 97. Ms. Channing’s voice, gravel-toned and deep, was as distinctive as her appearance.Over the course of her life, and around the world, Ms. Channing played the title role of the matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi more than 5,000 times by her count.“Performing is the only excuse for my existence,” she said during her last Broadway appearance, in 1995. “What can be better than this?”Have a dazzling night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

"What to Cook Tonight - The New York Times
Good morning. There is a lot of delicious prose in the Food section of The Times that we shipped off to the printer on Tuesday, so it could slide into the blue bags we throw at subscribers’ doors in the dark early Wednesday when no one’s out but street cats and can’t-sleep joggers. Whap!Good reading: Ligaya Mishan on the business and culture of global food tours; Pete Wells on Violet, a Manhattan restaurant inspired by the food of Rhode Island; Eric Asimov on the pleasures of modern Australian wine; Sara Bonisteel on the history and preparation of Nanaimo bars, one of Canada’s most popular desserts, made entirely from packaged ingredients.And a lot of great recipes, too: among them, David Tanis’s spring vegetable stew (above), served with brown-butter couscous, and Melissa Clark’s polenta with blue cheese and crispy leeks.On Wednesdays, of course, we don’t always cook with recipes, preferring sometimes to follow the no-recipe recipe route instead, and improvise off a theme. Today’s is rice and beans, the beans of the canned variety, jazzed up with what’s sitting around your pantry and fridge. My latest: a sofrito of chopped bacon, pickled banana peppers, shallots, garlic, cilantro, cumin, salt and orange juice, all of it cooked down into a kind of syrup, with a can of black beans mixed into it, served over rice, with hot sauce, lime and buttered toast. This was an excellent dinner. (You can find more no-recipe recipes here.)Alternatively, make something where you can follow instructions and receive a treat in return: miso chicken, say, or salmon in parsley sauce.

"Brunei Hotel Boycott Gathers Steam as Anti-Gay Law Goes Into Effect - The New York Times
Celebrities and Los Angeles officials have called for a boycott against hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei, where a harsh law that makes gay sex punishable by death went into effect on Wednesday.The nine hotels are some of the most exclusive in the world and make up the Dorchester Collection, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the government. They include two where Hollywood moguls dine and entertainment glitterati are feted during awards season: the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Others include the Dorchester in London and the Hôtel Plaza Athénée in Paris.The new penal code in Brunei, a small monarchy on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia, is based on the most extreme interpretation of Shariah, an Islamic law based on the Quran and other writings. The law calls for death by stoning not only for sex between men but also for adultery. The penalty for theft is the amputation of limbs.“Every single time we stay at or take meetings at or dine at any of these nine hotels we are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens for being gay or accused of adultery,” George Clooney wrote in a column last week on the website Deadline.Mr. Clooney, an Academy Award-winning actor who has led humanitarian efforts in Darfur and Haiti, said he did not think a boycott would shame Brunei’s monarchy. “But you can shame the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them and choose to look the other way,” he wrote.Other celebrities and politicians from Los Angeles have condemned the new law and asked followers to stay away from the Sultan of Brunei’s properties. Ellen DeGeneres posted a tweet on Tuesday asking her followers to “spread the word” and “rise up.” It had been retweeted more than 70,000 times by Wednesday afternoon.The tennis legend Billie Jean King also warned about the new law on Wednesday, saying, “This atrocity begins today in #Brunei.” Last week, Elton John said he had avoided staying at Dorchester Collection hotels for years.Los Angeles politicians were equally pointed. On Tuesday, three City Council members proposed a resolution that officially condemned the government of Brunei “for adopting laws that impose extreme and inhumane penalties.” The proposal discouraged employees and residents from staying at or attending any functions at the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air unless the law was repealed.The city controller, Ron Galperin, said he was “outraged and horrified” by the law and posted photos of Hotel Bel-Air and the Beverly Hills Hotel with a red X through them.Representatives for the Dorchester Collection said in a statement on Wednesday that the company does “not tolerate any form of discrimination.”“Dorchester Collection’s Code emphasizes equality, respect and integrity in all areas of our operation, and strongly values people and cultural diversity amongst our guests and employees,” they said. “Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs.”This is not the first time Hollywood has called for a boycott of the two hotels because of Brunei’s punitive legal system. In 2014, the City Council unanimously passed a resolution urging the government of Brunei “to divest itself of the Beverly Hills Hotel” after a wave of high-profile protests in response to the country’s harsh punishments for adultery, abortion and homosexuality.But it is unclear what impact the boycott will have. Although the earlier protests resulted in a flood of cancellations, they did not move the Sultan to sell. In time, the issue faded and celebrities and their entourages returned."
"China, Honduras, Brexit: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times
(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Candida auris, a deadly fungus, preys on people with weakened immune systems and confuses doctors. It is spreading quietly across the globe, in Venezuela, Spain, Britain, India, Pakistan, South Africa and the U.S. Once the germ is present, it is hard to eradicate from a facility. Some hospitals have had to bring in special cleaning equipment and even rip out floor and ceiling tiles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently added it to a list of germs deemed “urgent threats.”Here are some basic facts about Candida auris.The problem: Fungi, just like bacteria, are evolving defenses to survive modern medicines. Even as world health leaders have pleaded for restraint in prescribing antimicrobial drugs to combat bacteria and fungi, overuse of them has continued.Risk: According to a study funded by the British government, if policies are not put in place to slow the rise of drug resistance, 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050, eclipsing the eight million expected to die that year from cancer.A smartphone app in China called Study the Great Nation is becoming a potent instrument of control for President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party.Users earn points by staying current on news about Mr. Xi, and many employers now require workers to submit daily screenshots documenting how many points they have earned.More than 100 million people have registered as users since the app was released this year, according to the state news media. That wide adoption stems, at least in part, from coercion.Related: A lurid online campaign that has targeted a Chinese activist now living in Canada appears to have the hallmarks of an attack by the Communist Party. On a monthlong trip in Honduras, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a photographer explored the rampant corruption and gang violence that is leading thousands of women to seek asylum in the U.S. Our Opinion section published their collaboration.The country is one of the world’s deadliest for women. Nine in 10 murders of women never go to court or result in a sentence. Women in one city described police responses to their domestic violence complaints: “You like getting hit, don’t you? Why don’t you resolve it between your bedsheets? Maybe you didn’t give him what he needed last night?”Women’s murders aren’t investigated or prosecuted because of a toxic stew of corruption, incompetence, and a lack of both resources and interest, the investigation found.Border news: President Trump announced that Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, is leaving her position. He has privately but regularly complained about Ms. Nielsen, blaming her for a rise in migrants entering the U.S.The World Health Organization considers asbestos a serial killer, and a 2014 report found it kills more than 107,000 people each year. Sixty countries have banned it.But for one Russian town 900 miles east of Moscow, nearly every family’s livelihood depends on the product. Many in Asbest, a top Russian producer of asbestos, reacted with glee to reports that the Environmental Protection Agency under President Trump was relaxing tight restrictions on asbestos use in the United States.Local perspective: The view of many Asbest residents is that there are so many other things to worry about in their heavily industrialized region, including a nuclear power station just a few miles away and an even nearer coal-fired power plant, that asbestos is probably the least of their worries.“Everything is potentially dangerous,” one resident said. “Why worry about asbestos so much?”In 1981, a lawmaker strolled into India’s upper house wearing a garland of onions to protest the staple’s rising price. The vegetable necklace has been a popular protest accessory ever since.Across India, onions are among the few ingredients used in almost every dish, alongside salt and potatoes, making them economically and politically important.Governments can fall when crop failures, price fixing or inflation send costs up. Such factors contributed to the demise of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government in 2014.In this year’s election, though, low prices are the problem. Onion and potato prices have plunged along with those of other foods, and the country’s 100 million farmers are suffering. That’s a big voting sector.Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress Party are offering farmers loan relief in the states they govern, and say they will have more solutions if they win in national elections. But some farmers aren’t interested in giving the B.J.P. and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, another chance.In a new book about Indian voters’ moods, “Democracy on the Road,” the investor Ruchir Sharma writes, “Lately, farmers have told us they planned to vote against their incumbent government” because of “frustration over depressed crop prices.” — Alisha Haridasani GuptaSend us feedback or questions here.Britain: Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to seek another delay to Brexit from already exasperated European leaders, who are set to meet on Wednesday. And she signaled a willingness to compromise with the Labour Party in talks over passing a departure plan, though those talks remained stalled. Rwanda: Twenty-five years since the start of the Rwandan genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 to one million people died as the Hutu majority massacred members of the Tutsi minority, President Emmanuel Macron of France said he wanted to create a national day of commemoration in France, whose handling of the genocide remains controversial.Libya: The U.S. military evacuated its small contingent of troops from Tripoli, the capital, as rival militias raced to stop the forces of an aspiring strongman, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, from taking control of the city.Snapshot: Above, a vineyard in Bordeaux, France. In a region synonymous with wine making, some are anxious about new Chinese owners who have given historic chateaus new names like “Tibetan Antelope.” Naomi Osaka: By the tennis star’s 22nd birthday in October, she will have to choose between her U.S. and Japanese citizenship. The looming deadline is raising questions about whether she can continue to represent Japan on the international tennis circuit, and adding new pressure on the Japanese government to allow dual citizenship.What we’re reading: This first-person piece in The Cut. John Schwartz, a Times climate reporter, recommends it. “Lizzie O’Leary, one of my journalism heroes, recently resurfaced this 2017 essay about the sexual harassment she’s experienced,” he says. “I’m thinking maybe I should read it at least once a year, and maybe you should, too.”Cook: This easy pie uses crumbled speculoos cookies in its crust, and a cookie butter spread on top.Listen: Khalid broke out in 2017 with “American Teen.” On his second full-length album, he suspends his demons in melodies and rhythms that take cues from R&B’s past.Watch: Did you watch the “Killing Eve” Season 2 premiere last night? Check out our mood board of the disparate places from which the show’s creators drew inspiration.Read: Twenty-five years ago, on April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain died at 27, a victim of suicide. Here’s what to read, watch and explore about the Nirvana frontman and grunge icon.Smarter Living: Our smartphones tend to occupy hours of our time, but Androids and iPhones have tools to reduce your tap tally. For executing tasks, voice assistants are pretty reliable. Set your alarm by saying “Wake me at 7:30 a.m.” Or try “Turn on the flashlight.” And saying “Do not disturb” as you enter a movie theater or a meeting is an easy way to save yourself embarrassment. We also have advice about how to deal with jerks, without being a jerk back.Latin American ministers are descending on Quito, Ecuador’s capital, today to discuss Venezuela’s migration crisis.The choice of location raises a question: When problems erupt on the continent, is there a dominant city where they’re hammered out?Not exactly.The city with the largest population is Mexico’s capital. The regional finance capital is Panama City. Brasília is the capital of Brazil, which has the continent’s biggest economy. Latin America’s exiles — from the Cubans to the Venezuelans themselves — head north to Miami, where Spanish is often more commonly spoken than English.A peace agreement with Colombia’s rebels was even hammered out in Havana, a capital that had longstanding ties to both the rebels and the Colombian government. While other parts of the world have centers of gravity — think of Beijing, Brussels and Washington — Latin America is still searching for its own."
"India, Brexit, Rwanda: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times
(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)A tenacious fungus called Candida auris, which can kill people with weakened immune systems, has appeared in countries around the world over the past five years. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed it an “urgent threat.” Hospitals and governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks, and a hushed panic is playing out. Here are some basic facts about the fungal infection.Big picture: Antibiotics are credited with saving tens of millions of lives. Health experts have long warned that their overuse was helping spawn drug-resistant bacteria, and now scientists are seeing an explosion of resistant fungi as well.Another angle: Antibiotics have never been more accessible to the world’s poor, thanks in large part to the mass production of generics in China and India. But in an impoverished community in Kenya, their cheapness and prodigious use have fueled the evolution of deadly infections like salmonella.A smartphone app in China called Study the Great Nation is becoming a potent instrument of control for President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party.Users earn points by staying current on news about Mr. Xi. More than 100 million people have registered as users since its release this year, according to the state news media.

Domestic murders are common, and many women are killed by drug cartels and gangs, often in gruesome ways intended to spread terror. Nine out of 10 murders of women never go to court or result in a sentence.Border concerns: President Trump announced that Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, is leaving her position. He has privately but regularly complained about Ms. Nielsen, blaming her for a rise in migrants entering the U.S.Another angle: The U.S. government said in court documents that it might take two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border.The housing market has cooled, and a sense of pessimism colors conversations about the economy in Australia, especially among the young. And that can seem strange, since the country is nearing 28 years without a recession. Our Upshot columnist, pondering the U.S.’s approach of 10 recession-free years, visited Australia to see whether it had lessons in resilience to offer the rest of the world.Conclusions: The idea of the “business cycle” may be a misleading way to think about economic growth. Recessions may not be inevitable or productive. Smart choices can make them rarer and less damaging.

But some farmers aren’t interested in giving the B.J.P. and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, another chance.In a new book about Indian voters’ moods, “Democracy on the Road,” the investor Ruchir Sharma writes: “Lately, farmers have told us they planned to vote against their incumbent government” because of “frustration over depressed crop prices.” — Alisha Haridasani GuptaSend us feedback or questions here.Britain: Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to seek another delay to Brexit from already exasperated European leaders, who meet on Wednesday.

"Senate Vote, Ethiopian Airlines, Pi Day: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times
(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The Senate voted to block President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the border with Mexico, setting up the first veto of his presidency.Twelve Republicans joined all 47 Democratic senators, after the House passed a similar resolution last month. The declaration would have redirected $3.6 billion from military construction projects toward building the border wall, even after Congress rejected a funding request.The bipartisan rebuke was the first time Congress has blocked a presidential emergency declaration. “It’s pure and simple: It’s a vote for border security, it’s a vote for no crime,” Mr. Trump, above, told reporters ahead of the vote.Earlier in the day, the House voted overwhelmingly to demand the public release of the special counsel’s report on the Russia investigation._____2. The captain of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines jetliner seemed calm at first. Then he sounded panicked.Minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday, his Boeing 737 Max 8 had accelerated to abnormally high speeds. “Break break, request back to home,” he urgently radioed controllers, who had seen that the jet was oscillating vertically by hundreds of feet.These details, provided to our reporter by a person who reviewed the air traffic communications, shed chilling new detail about the final minutes of the jet, which crashed, killing all 157 people aboard.Many pilots are abuzz about the strange acceleration. And some are worried their hands-on flying skills are lacking amid increased automation, in the wake of recent crashes of 737 Max 8s, above, in Indonesia and Ethiopia._____3. In other international news:Lawmakers in Britain voted to delay the country’s departure from the European Union beyond the original March 29 deadline after two years of negotiations. In a flurry of votes on several amendments, Parliament, above, also rejected holding a second referendum on Brexit.Separately, two rockets were fired at Tel Aviv from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military reported. One landed in an open area, and the other was intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system. Initial Israeli news media reports said there was no damage or casualties._____4. The relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook massacre won a major court battle over gunmakers’ liability in mass shootings.The ruling, which allows a lawsuit brought by relatives to go to trial, could force gun companies to turn over internal communications they have fought to keep private. It also validates the new strategy lawyers used to find a route around federal protections for gunmakers. Above, Bill Sherlach, whose wife was killed in the shooting, responding to the ruling.“I am thrilled and tremendously grateful,” said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, was killed in his first-grade classroom in the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. “No one has blanket immunity.”_____5. There were pole-vaulters who didn’t pole-vault. A tennis player who didn’t play a single tennis match. A long snapper who weighed 145 pounds and had stopped playing football.The largest college admissions scandal in recent history has shed new light on the role of college sports in gaining entry to the nation’s top schools.As the scandal broke, students at a school in Kansas City, Mo., who had been working for months to gain entrance into some of the same universities named in court documents called it a harsh lesson in the limits of meritocracy.We also went to the University of Southern California, one of the schools most entangled in the scandal, where four athletics officials are charged with taking bribes, more than the number named at any other school._____6. In 2020 news, Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, is running for president.Mr. O’Rourke, above in Iowa, a Democrat whose near-miss Senate run against Ted Cruz propelled him to stardom last year, announced his intention in a video on his Twitter profile. He has been criticized for not taking a strong enough stance on key Democratic issues — he has declined to call himself a progressive — and for his lack of a campaign infrastructure.We also took a look at how Texas is nearing battleground status._____7. The reputed Gambino mob boss Frank Cali was murdered outside his home on Staten Island.Until Wednesday, it had been decades since an organized crime leader had been killed in New York City. The Gambino family was once the nation’s largest and most influential Mafia group, but several of its leaders were convicted in the 1990s of crimes like murder and racketeering. Above, the scene outside Mr. Cali’s home.Mr. Cali, 53, rose to power by avoiding detection, nothing like John Gotti, the “Dapper Don” who ruled the same operation when Mr. Cali was a little boy. Here are five other high-profile mob hits in New York City from over the years._____8. Japan’s ice monsters are disappearing.Tourists from around the world travel to see the juhyo — huge, Godzilla-like creatures, naturally formed by snow and ice, encasing conifer trees spread across a mountainous landscape. Researchers have tracked a steady deterioration of the ice monsters because of warming temperatures.“I am very worried about greenhouse effects,” said a professor. “By the end of the century, the juhyo will disappear from Earth.” Above, a student collecting snow to sample for airborne contaminants.In other climate news, students in more than 100 countries are planning to skip class on Friday to demand action on climate change._____9. Hudson Yards is Manhattan’s biggest, newest, slickest gated community, according to our architecture critic, who calls it “a relic of dated 2000s thinking.”At $25 billion, the Far West Side development, above, is the largest mixed-use private real estate venture in American history. Many of its tenants were lured by lucrative tax breaks provided by New York politicians to the developers.“It is, at heart, a supersized suburban-style office park, with a shopping mall and a quasi-gated condo community targeted at the 0.1 percent,” Michael Kimmelman, our critic, writes._____10. Finally, happy Pi Day!Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, something the internet reminds us of every March 14 (or 3.14). But the famous mathematical ratio, estimated to more than 22 trillion digits (and counting), is the perfect symbol for our species’ long effort to tame infinity, one mathematician, Steven Strogatz, writes.“For some people, Pi Day is an occasion to marvel at circles, long revered as symbols of perfection, reincarnation and the cycles of nature,” writes Mr. Strogatz. “But it is the domestication of infinity that we really should be celebrating.” Above, the Children’s Museum of Houston’s celebration for Pi Day in 2011.Or if you’d rather use the unofficial holiday as an excuse to have a slice of pie, that’s O.K., too.Have a sweet night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

"Fallout From College Admissions Scandal: Arrests, Damage Control and a Scramble for Answers - The New York Times
BOSTON — Two of the colleges caught up in a sweeping admissions fraud investigation said on Wednesday that they were considering disciplining students who were connected to the scheme. And the fallout from the case was just beginning.[The college admissions scandal has raised a lot of questions. We’ve answered them here.]Colleges where coaches were accused of taking bribes were reeling. Wealthy and well-known parents charged in the case were preparing to make their first appearances in court or were free on bail. And companies were distancing themselves from executives accused of paying a consultant to use bribes and deceit to raise their children’s test scores or get them admitted to their chosen schools through athletic recruiting spots, despite their not being competitive athletes.The University of California, Los Angeles, where the former men’s soccer coach is accused of taking $200,000 in bribes to help two students gain admission, warned Wednesday that it might punish students whose applications contained misrepresentations, including by revoking their admission.“If U.C.L.A. discovers that any prospective, admitted or enrolled student has misrepresented any aspect of his/her application, or that information about the applicant has been withheld, U.C.L.A. may take a number of disciplinary actions, up to and including cancellation of admission,” the university said in a statement.The University of Southern California, where three coaches and the senior associate athletic director were charged with taking bribes, said that it would reject any current applicants who are connected to the bribery scheme.Wanda Austin, the school’s interim president, also said that current students whose parents have been charged with paying the bribes would also be investigated. It is unclear how many current or prospective U.S.C. students are implicated.These were the first indications that students themselves would face consequences in the scandal. While prosecutors have charged 33 wealthy parents, they have not charged any students. Andrew E. Lelling, the United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, described parents as “the prime movers of this fraud.”Also on Wednesday, several of the parents who were charged in the case appeared or were expected to appear in court.The actress Lori Loughlin surrendered to F.B.I. agents in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, a spokeswoman for the agency said. Ms. Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters accepted as recruits for the rowing team at the University of Southern California, even though neither took part in the sport. Mr. Giannulli was arrested on Tuesday and released on $1 million bail.Ms. Loughlin appeared in court on Wednesday afternoon. Hours before, local TV crews were lined up on the sidewalk outside the Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles. In the courtroom, wearing large glasses and a cream sweater, Ms. Loughlin looked calmly forward sitting behind a pane of glass. She glanced once at the reporters packed into the seats.She agreed to post $1 million bond secured by her home. The judge allowed her to travel the continental United States and to the province of British Columbia for work projects, through December of this year with supervision. She was expected to be released Wednesday afternoon.Other prominent parents were placed on leave from their employers or stepped down from other posts.Gordon Caplan, a co-chairman of the global law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who is accused of paying $75,000 to have someone correct his daughter’s answers on the ACT exam, was put on leave by his firm on Wednesday. Reached by phone, Mr. Caplan declined to comment.William E. McGlashan Jr., a partner at the private equity firm TPG, was also placed on leave on Tuesday by his company. On Wednesday, he stepped down from the board of STX Entertainment, the film studio that he helped found with the film producer Robert Simonds. The news was shared in an internal memo sent to STX employees and reviewed by The New York Times.STX is funded in large part by Mr. McGlashan’s firm, TPG. STX said in the internal note that TPG remained committed to the studio, whose movies include the comedy “The Edge of Seventeen.”The central figure in the case, William Singer, a college admissions consultant based in Newport Beach, Calif., pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges in Boston on Tuesday and was released on bond.The colleges where coaches were accused of taking bribes, a group that included the University of Southern California, Stanford, Yale, U.C.L.A. and Georgetown, have generally portrayed themselves as victims of the scheme. The coaches who were still employed at the schools when the charges were announced were all either fired or placed on leave.Also on Wednesday, the University of Texas at Austin announced that it had fired its men’s tennis coach, Michael Center, who was charged with taking a bribe of $100,000 from Mr. Singer in 2015 in exchange for recruiting a student who was not a competitive tennis player.In a letter sent to the university community on Tuesday, Yale’s president, Peter Salovey, wrote: “As the indictment makes clear, the Department of Justice believes that Yale has been the victim of a crime perpetrated by a former coach who no longer works at the university. We do not believe that any member of the Yale administration or staff other than the charged coach knew about the conspiracy. The university has cooperated fully in the investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case moves forward.”[Fifty people were charged in the widespread scheme to get undeserving students into colleges.]The accusations against Mr. Singer, also known as Rick Singer, pose potential problems for the organizations behind the two most widely used college admissions tests, the SAT and the ACT, which most colleges weigh in evaluating prospective students.According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer bribed test administrators and proctors to tamper with students’ answer sheets, or in some cases to take the whole test in a student’s place, to obtain the scores that were agreed in advance with the parents who paid him.The conspiracy relied on the parents getting medical documentation that would entitle their children to extra time on the test, an accommodation normally made for students with disabilities. Students who need extra time generally take the test alone, supervised only by a proctor — providing the opportunity for a bribed proctor to rig the outcome. Mr. Singer advised parents on how to get the medical documentation needed to qualify.According to court filings, in a conversation with Mr. Caplan, Mr. Singer explained that for $4,000 or $5,000, a psychologist he worked with would write a report saying Mr. Caplan’s daughter had disabilities and required special accommodations. He assured Mr. Caplan that many parents did this for their children.“What happened is, all the wealthy families that figured out that if I get my kid tested and they get extended time, they can do better on the test,” Mr. Singer said in the conversation. “So most of these kids don’t even have issues, but they’re getting time. The playing field is not fair.”Zachary Goldberg, a spokesman for the College Board, which administers the SAT, defended the extra-time policy. “The College Board considers all reasonable requests for accommodations — such as large print, Braille, or extended time — needed by students with documented disabilities,” he said.The board asks for documentation in some cases, Mr. Goldberg said, but in the “vast majority” of cases, the modifications are granted through the schools that students attend, where they are evaluated and given an individualized education program.Mr. Goldberg said that the people who administer the SAT in schools, including test-center supervisors and proctors, are recruited and assigned by the schools.“Deliberate misconduct by testing staff is rare and, if it does occur, can result in the staff member or even the school being barred from further testing,” he said.Mr. Goldberg said that the board had worked with law enforcement on this case, and that the arrests sent a message that “those who facilitate cheating on the SAT — regardless of their income or status — will be held accountable.”"
"Review: In ‘The White Devil,’ Pick Your Poison - The New York Times
If you find plausible psychology aggravating and a humane outlook just rubs you the wrong way, please meet John Webster. A playwright with a deep devotion to gore, he churned out some of the 17th-century’s most lurid tragedies and there was nothing — books, a helmet, a tennis racket, a fart — that he didn’t long to empoison. (The urchin from “Shakespeare in Love” who liked to torture mice? That’s him.) Red Bull Theater resurrects his 1612 play, “The White Devil” with mischief and raunch and sibling incest and maybe necrophilia, because hey, why not? Anyone expecting Shakespeare might see if the box office does refunds.T.S. Eliot famously credited Webster as showing the skull beneath the skin. The director Louisa Proske’s production shows some skin, too. The set thrusts impudently into the audience and the costumes, by Beth Goldenberg, look like knock-off Versace, appropriate to this sleazy imagined Padua. Here, the Duke of Brachiano (Daniel Oreskes) is infatuated with Vittoria Corombona (Lisa Birnbaum). (“The White Devil” was based on a true story. Like a lot of its characters, that basis is loose.) The snag: They’re both married to other people. The solution: Murder. In a Webster play, murders are like jelly beans. Who can stop at just one?In the play’s first half, Ms. Proske doesn’t seem to have decided how seriously she should take Webster’s mad, bad world. But in the second half, more enjoyable, she seems to have figured out that just because everyone and everything is terrible doesn’t mean we can’t party down. The play bops from one shockaroo to the next, indicting religion, politics and the patriarchy, when it’s not busy with the blood packs. Sometimes the staging is too much — there are some terrible video sequences and then some better ones — but typically it’s stylish and spry.Webster’s verse is a blunt, evocative instrument. Though Ms. Proske could have cut some of the more obscure lines, the figurative language catches the ear like a barbed hook. Characters speak of the “soft down of an insatiable bed,” of poison under “gilded pills,” of playing football with severed heads. If there had been psychoanalysts in 17th-century England, they would have had a field day with this stuff.Certainly the cast has a nice wallow. A couple of the more seasoned actors, like Jenny Bacon, who plays the duke’s not-long-for-this-world duchess; T. Ryder Smith who plays her conniving brother; and Derek Smith who plays both Vittoria’s doomed husband and then her murderer, are able to layer three or four big, distinct emotions onto each line, to meet the play’s extravagances with energy and rigor.Because if the play is incontrovertibly over-the-top, decadent and then some — I mean, the revenge plot even enlists the pope — it has its own complexities. Are the murders meant to condemn immorality or celebrate it? You tell me. And in the character of Vittoria, whom Ms. Birnbaum embodies with vigor and a high ponytail, he has created, with obvious ambivalence, a singular antiheroine. His Vittoria is both a protofeminist who outargues the men around her (“I scorn to hold my life/At yours, or any man’s entreaty, sir”) and a “strumpet,” a “whore” who meets a stabby end, unmourned.Nihilism can leave a bitter taste in your mouth, but Webster is such fun to bite into, an invitation to revel in people at their very worst, to taste depravity. If that depravity leaves you feeling a little dirty, isn’t that the point? As the cardinal says, “Dost thou imagine, thou canst slide on blood,/And not be tainted?” Exactly."

"Top Lawyer Latest to Probe Death of Teen Trapped in Minivan - The New York Times
CINCINNATI — A prominent civil rights attorney is the latest to seek answers into what happened a year ago when a Cincinnati teenager became trapped in his family's minivan near his school and died after making two heartrending appeals to 911 for rescue.Al Gerhardstein has in recent weeks made sweeping records requests to the city and police about the failed response April 10, 2018, to Kyle Plush's calls . The 16-year-old student eventually suffocated from having his chest compressed after he was apparently pinned by a foldaway rear seat when he reached for tennis gear while parked near his school.""We're investigating on behalf of the family,"" Gerhardstein said. ""That's all I can say.""He has asked for reports, recordings and other records on the 911 response. Much of that information has already been reported by The Associated Press and other news outlets, but the attorney is also trying to go deeply into any history of problems at the emergency center.The veteran Cincinnati attorney has a history of litigation against the city and police, and he represented lead plaintiff James Obergefell in the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage.The police department and city didn't respond to requests for comment about Gerhardstein's efforts.The possibility of a lawsuit is the latest development in the year since Plush's death. It led to multiple investigations and to improvements in the city's 911 system technology, staffing, training and police procedures.But the youth's parents, who started a foundation to push for nationwide reforms, have expressed dissatisfaction .Jill and Ron Plush took part repeatedly in city council meetings last year, pushing for reforms and accountability for their son's death. Using the voice-activated feature on his cellphone, he had Siri dial 911, warning: ""I'm going to die here."" He called again minutes later, this time describing his vehicle as a gold Honda Odyssey.Two police officers drove around at the boy's high school looking for him but left without getting out of their cruiser. Kyle's father found his body nearly six hours after his first 911 call. Police have blamed communication breakdowns.""I'm heartbroken,"" Police Chief Eliot Isaac told the city council late last year, adding that officers and dispatchers are ""heartbroken, as well, that they didn't get the help to this young man. But we can sit here and we can Monday morning quarterback this thing — but the reality is there were some failures and some breakdowns, and we have to be better.""There have also been questions raised about the safety of the 2004 Odyssey. Honda in 2017 recalled some 900,000 later-model Odysseys because of concerns about second-row seats tipping forward if not latched properly, but spokesman Chris Martin said there were no seat-related recalls of the 2004 model. Honda, he said, hasn't been given access to the Plush vehicle.""The bottom line is that we're still interested in inspecting the vehicle in order to learn more about what may have happened,"" Martin said in an email. ""This is the only instance of its type, and there is no pattern of similar incidents from which to draw any conclusions. Even if we could inspect, there's no guarantee that we could definitively say what happened.""Thus, this one may remain a tragic mystery,"" Martin said.Meanwhile, the Plush family has pledged to memorialize him by continuing to push for 911 reforms across the nation and supporting emergency communications employees through a foundation in Kyle's name.""He would have wanted us to make changes, and to overcome obstacles to make changes to save lives so that this doesn't happen again,"" Jill Plush said recently at the Hancock County 911 Center, among visits the family and foundation volunteers made to several Indianapolis area centers, according to the Greenfield Daily Reporter newspaper.___"
"‘So Disheartening’: At Colleges Embroiled in Scandal, a Sense of Outrage and Sadness - The New York Times
Rarely is there a single conversation that dominates the college campuses of America, a back-and-forth that extends from Palo Alto, Calif., to Winston-Salem, N.C., and from New Haven, Conn., to Los Angeles.There was one this week.In classrooms and dining halls, on quads and in bars, there was a similar sense of astonishment. How could they? Can you believe it? United by an admissions scandal that touched so many of their campuses, students seethed in unison. They railed against privilege and greed. They worried that their diplomas might have been tarnished even before they were handed to them on stage.Two Stanford University students channeled their fury into a class-action lawsuit that claims they wasted their money when they applied to schools that were ultimately linked to what the Justice Department called its largest ever college admissions prosecution.At Yale, a 20-year-old junior said she felt vindicated because her stellar grades had earned her acceptance — not cheating or kickbacks.At Georgetown, arguments erupted between students in classes and others offered their loan applications to each other as satirical proof that their parents had not wielded their wallets to gain them a spot.“When the rich, famous and influential game a system already susceptible to corruption, it perpetuates who remains in power,” said Jessica Wolfrom, a graduate student at Georgetown. “And, really, what does it mean when the system itself is so competitive that the people with the most privilege and wealth feel they have to cheat and lie and pay people off to get their kids ahead? Where does that leave everyone else?”[Read about the completely legal and largely unregulated world of private college consulting.]At the University of California, Los Angeles — among the campuses ensnared in the shocking scheme — students like Ayesha Haleem said she and her classmates were both heartbroken and fuming.“The higher education system has always benefited people who come from privileged backgrounds,” said Ms. Haleem, a Pakistani 23-year-old senior. “Students of color have it so much harder to even get to these places.”The issue of race-based admissions dominated conversations at the University of Texas at Austin, which was party to a landmark affirmative action case several years ago and has a student body that is now 41 percent white, down from 62.7 percent in 2000.The university’s men’s tennis coach, Michael Center, was fired Wednesday after he was accused of taking a $100,000 bribe in exchange for recruiting a well-off student who was not a competitive tennis player.“This is a big story not just because of possible corruption, but also because there is an obvious rift this has exposed on campus,” said Forrest Milburn, a 23-year-old senior who is the managing editor of The Daily Texan, the campus newspaper. “People are thinking it’s affirmative action when really it’s just wealth and privilege that gets you in the door.”[Read more on how the admissions scandal has been a harsh reminder of racial disparities.]The scandal’s legal fallout is most likely only beginning, and it has already spread beyond the criminal indictments that federal prosecutors made public this week.On Wednesday, just one day after prosecutors announced the charges in the so-called Operation Varsity Blues, two Stanford University students brought a class-action complaint in a federal court in California, and accused college after college of negligence. Although the suit was amended on Thursday — dropping one of the students but adding other plaintiffs without ties to Stanford — the case was an example of the exasperation on campuses.The plaintiffs in the case alleged that they had wasted money when they applied to schools that were ultimately ensnared in the scheme and that every “qualified, rejected” student had also been hurt by the coast-to-coast fraud.Many of the universities, though, have moved swiftly to fire coaches implicated in the scheme. Parents have made first appearances in court. And companies have distanced themselves from executives accused of paying William Singer, a college admissions consultant, to use bribes and deceit to raise their children’s test scores or get them admitted to their chosen schools through athletic recruiting spots, despite the fact that they were not competitive athletes.In a brief court appearance on Friday, a Vancouver businessman who is accused of paying Mr. Singer at least $200,000 between 2011 and 2013 to have a hired test administrator take the SAT in place of each of his two sons, and a Canadian high school graduation exam for his older son, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.The businessman, David Sidoo, was released on $1.5 million bail, under conditions including that he was not to travel beyond the United States or Canada. He was the first parent to enter a plea.[Learn more about how families who have legally hired college admissions consultants view the ethics of their choices.]U.C.L.A. warned this week that it might punish students who were connected to the scheme, including those already admitted or enrolled, “up to and including cancellation of admission,” the university said in a statement.Wake Forest said that a student who had been admitted after $100,000 in payments were routed through the volleyball coach was still enrolled on the campus in Winston-Salem, N.C., adding that it had no reason to believe that the student had been aware of the scheme.And Stanford said the two prospective students caught up in the case were never admitted; one did not even apply. Still, students at the Palo Alto, Calif., campus said they were deeply disappointed that their university was enmeshed in the scandal.“I worked so hard to get admitted into the school,” said Hailee Hoffman, a 22-year-old senior who is on the gymnastics team. In addition to taking advanced placement classes, she said she also trained more than 30 hours a week while in high school. “To find that someone had exploited the system and tried to buy their way in was so disheartening.”[Read more about how the authorities say the scheme worked, from bribes to doctored photos.]About a year ago, federal prosecutors working on a securities fraud case were tipped off to the elaborate scheme by a suspect who hoped to be granted leniency for his cooperation. The suspect, identified by The Wall Street Journal as Morrie Tobin, who attended Yale University and is now a Los Angeles financial executive, reportedly told investigators that the college’s soccer coach had sought a bribe in exchange for getting his daughter into the school.This week, the campus was mostly quiet because of Spring Break. But students were still abuzz about the scandal. Britton O’Daly, the editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, which has published three stories about the university’s connection, said he was spending the week in silence at a French monastery. But he could not stop himself from “sneaking away from monks to check my phone because of all this.”Students whose parents were charged in the case could not be reached for comment this week. But Jack Buckingham, whose mother, Jane Buckingham, is accused of paying $50,000 for an ACT proctor to take the test in his place, told The Hollywood Reporter that he was unknowingly involved in a plot that gave those “who may not work as hard as others an advantage over those who truly deserve those spots.”“For that I am sorry,” he told the publication, adding that this might “finally cut down on money and wealth being such a heavy factor in college admissions.”Olivia Jade Giannulli, a 19-year-old social media influencer whose celebrity parents were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes for her and her sister to be falsely recruited to U.S.C.’s rowing team, has remained silent. But she was dropped from a sponsorship with a makeup company and her Instagram account has been the target of vitriol.This week, as the scandal unfolded and her parents were arrested, Ms. Giannulli was celebrating Spring Break on a yacht owned by a U.S.C. Board of Trustees member. On Thursday, TMZ reported that she and her sister, also a U.S.C. student, decided to drop out over fears of being bullied and would not return to campus next week.Still, there was also a measure of sympathy for those unwittingly caught in their parents’ alleged deception.“I know that I would feel pretty ashamed if my parents were embroiled in a scandal of this magnitude,” Ms. Wolfrom said. “If I were in their position, I am not sure I’d show up to class again anytime soon.”"
"Muguruza Retains Monterrey Title as Injured Azarenka Retires - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Spain's Garbine Muguruza successfully defended her Monterrey Open title on Sunday when Victoria Azarenka retired injured from her first WTA singles final in three years. Second seed Muguruza was leading the match between the two former world number ones 6-1 3-1 when Azarenka decided she was unable to continue because of an injury to her right leg.""It's unfortunate I couldn't give my best today, but I tried my hardest,"" a tearful Azarenka, who had not previously reached final since the birth of her first child in December 2016, said at the presentation.""I want to say thank you to my son Leo, who is not with me here. I would love him to be here to share this with me because it is special.""The crowd responded with a chant of ""Vika! Vika! Vika!"". Muguruza's victory never looked in doubt and ensured that the record run of different women winning WTA titles this season would be extended to 16 tournaments.The former French Open and Wimbledon champion broke the pained Belarusian three times in the first set and again in the fourth game of the second.""It's a great feeling to come back and defend a title,"" Muguruza said in a courtside interview. ""It's never easy.""Azarenka received treatment on her leg during a medical time-out between sets, but it became apparent as the second set began that her movement had become significantly hampered.Azarenka was grimacing and stretching after nearly every point and, after Muguruza broke for a 3-1 lead, the two-time Australian Open champion decided to call it quits.The Belarusian had entered the final full of hope after surprising top seed Angelique Kerber 6-4 4-6 6-1 in Saturday's semi-finals.Azarenka had won her only previous meeting with Muguruza in the round of 16 at the Miami Open in April 2016, when she went on to win the title in her most recent final before Sunday.

"Keys Defeats Wozniacki for First Time to Claim Charleston Title - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Madison Keys overpowered Caroline Wozniacki 7-6(5) 6-3 to win the Charleston Open and defeat the former world number one for the first time on Sunday.The win, her first on clay court, broke a nearly two-year drought for the eighth seeded American, who claimed her fourth career title.Her previous two losses to Denmark's Wozniacki had been on hard courts when Keys failed to win a set.""I think I served really well today, said Keys, who had predicted on Saturday that playing on clay would be beneficial in her bid to defeat Wozniacki.""I also felt I kept a lot of pressure on her, making a lot of returns and keeping rallies going and not going for things too early,"" said the world number 18, who won 76 percent of points on her first serve, and fired six aces.""More than anything I really trusted my game and went for my shots.""That was most evident late in the first set and the tiebreak. The big-serving Keys trailed 5-6 in the opening set before forcing the tiebreak, which remained close until 4-3 when the fifth-seeded Wozniacki double faulted.Keys won the next point but twice had backhand errors to allow Wozniacki to pull within 6-5.A backhand down the line enabled Keys to finally claim the set.""I just knew the games I was losing in the first set I was just being too tentative and not really trusting my shot,"" said the 24-year-old American.""I knew I had to go for it. I think that's how I have to play... 100 percent believing in my game."" Keys broke Wozniacki in the sixth game of the second set to go up 4-2 and when she made it 5-2 that all but clinched the match.""It's definitely been a really great week for me, especially after having some really tough losses the last couple of weeks,"" Keys said. ""It definitely is a very good springboard for heading over to Europe."" (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"

"Wait — Is Qai Qai America’s Most Important Doll? - The New York Times
“Wait —” is a weekly newsletter in which Caity Weaver investigates an unanswered (and possibly unasked) question in the news and pop culture. See last week’s inaugural edition and sign up here to receive it in your inbox going forward.One spring evening in 1901, a doctor in Massachusetts laid a tuberculosis-stricken man on a wooden platform so that the doctor could watch him die, and hopefully calculate the weight of his soul. For three hours and 40 minutes, Duncan MacDougall recalibrated his scales by fractions of ounces as the dying man’s nose and mouth dried out, and his last sweat evaporated off his skin. At the moment of the patient’s death (9:10 p.m.), Dr. MacDougall recorded that the scales registered an abrupt, inexplicable weight loss of three-fourths of an ounce. (To be certain this was not the effect of all the man’s breath leaving his body, the doctor then climbed onto the bed and breathed deeply; this did not affect the scales.) This incident gave rise to a notion that the human soul weighs roughly 21 grams; however, the doctor’s subsequent experiments, including a frantic attempt to document the weight of a woman dying of a diabetic coma, failed to achieve identical results. (Dr. MacDougall complained that that effort was thwarted by “a good deal of interference by people opposed to our work,” perhaps medical staff attempting to save a woman dying of a diabetic coma, a circumstance that need not be fatal.) A century later, Dr. MacDougall’s hypothesis has been largely rejected. But we do now possess the technology to know what a celebrity’s daughter’s doll is thinking.Qai Qai is a baby doll with brown plastic skin, wrinkled newborn feet, a blithe countenance and over 90,000 Instagram followers at most recent tally. She is the plaything of Olympia Ohanian, the daughter of the tennis star Serena Williams and her tech entrepreneur husband, Alexis Ohanian. Qai Qai is apparently also the direct descendant of Olympia Ohanian; text on her riveting (and verified) Instagram account, @RealQaiQai, identifies her as the “granddaughter” of Ms. Williams and Mr. Ohanian. It’s pronounced “kway kway.”Qai Qai takes several (known) forms: She is a doll; an Instagram user; a Twitter user; an animated representation of a doll superimposed onto digital photos; and an imagined Gremlin-like character wreaking pretend havoc on the hypothetical lives of Olympia Ohanian and her family. Qai Qai appears to have entered our collective consciousness early last August, when Ms. Williams uploaded a video of the doll lying in tricycle wreckage, explaining off-camera that she was documenting the scene “for Olympia’s insurance.” (She also accused Qai Qai of “vandalism.”) On Aug. 14, Ms. Williams told reporters at a post-match news conference that she was “kind of having to take care of Qai Qai now” because her infant daughter wanted “to live her life.” That day, a Twitter account called @RealQaiQai posted its first tweet. The following week, the @RealQaiQai Instagram account shared its first post. Earlier this week, an ESPN2 graphic from the Australian Open reminded viewers that Ms. Williams’s daughter’s doll had twice as many Twitter followers as Ms. Williams’s current opponent, who lost the match.Why?Because Qai Qai is something increasingly rare and prized in modern online society: mildly entertaining.The earliest Qai Qai content was wordless, evocative imagery of abandonment: the doll lying facedown on hardwood floor and on private jet tarmac; stuffed behind a hotel suite cushion; jammed headfirst into a sandbox at a resort where Ms. Williams was participating in a tennis exhibition. For reasons never explained, her limbs were frequently set in plastic doll casts. Sometimes she was pictured with tiny crutches.The posts evolved. Some of the changes have enhanced the enjoyment of Qai Qai; the visual juxtaposition of the cherubic doll with new world-weary captions written from Qai Qai’s point of view could be genuinely funny, as when a slide show revealed Qai Qai emerging from behind a kitchen island to ask the world, “What y’all mad about today?” (Neither Ms. Williams nor Mr. Ohanian have claimed authorship.) It is pleasant to view drone footage of Qai Qai alone on a yacht uploaded by Mr. Ohanian. Other additions, like an animated graphic Qai Qai digitally imposed on extant photos that Ms. Williams and Mr. Ohanian interact with across social platforms, are less welcome.It’s not known how Olympia came to possess Qai Qai. The doll may have been quasi-anonymously forged in the opaque fires of e-commerce hell, because it is a nearly exact match to an out-of-stock toy sold on Amazon under the brand name Dolls to Play. (Luckily, I ordered one.)Dolls to Play appears to exist solely on Amazon; a Google search of the label leads to a random product repository website that redirects to multiple different, yet seemingly identical, random product repository websites, all of which appear to blindly scrape information from Amazon. Dolls to Play toys are sold by an Amazon storefront called “Number 1 in Service,” which stocks thousands of unrelated products (orders fulfilled by Amazon). The same bedroom stock image pictured in the Amazon listing for the doll also appears spliced with a bedding set on Wayfair, and empty on a spam blog of house decorating keywords interspersed with the phrase “in Nigeria.”The doll I received was not the doll pictured, which wore pink; it is an exact Qai Qai copy, dressed in white. The box says “MADE IN NANJING, CHINA” and also “BROOKLYN LOLLIPOPS” — a company that lists a Brooklyn address, at a co-working space. Brooklyn Lollipops has its own Amazon listing for the same doll, also available for purchase from Walmart.com (online only).Yet it is possible that the sensational Qai Qai found her way to Olympia Ohanian from a realm even weirder than the bowels of the internet: in real life. Qai Qai’s Twitter account recently shared an image of a store shelf stocked with multiple races of Qai Qai, which appear to cycle through the inventories of various discount department stores.If you would like to see more Qai Qai, many videos of the doll initially posted to Ms. Williams’s social media accounts can be found combined into odd YouTube compilations with unrelated real estate footage by an account called Hestia Olympia’ Celebrity, Lifestyle & Culture, the avatar of which is a French oil painting that has been a part of Russia’s State Hermitage Museum collection since it was acquired in 1764 by Catherine the Great as part a lot of hundreds of paintings “of uneven quality.”The combined weight of the doll named Qai Qai plus her stroller is approximately 1,293 grams: roughly 61-and-a-half souls."

"Opinion | Shambles - The New York Times
This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.I’m a fan of ranked-choice voting. I think it’s a fairer way to decide elections than the more common method, in which each person can vote for only a first choice. The 2000 presidential election highlighted the problem with this first-choice system. That year, more Floridians preferred Al Gore to George W. Bush. But Bush won, because some of the people who preferred Gore to Bush voted for Ralph Nader as their first choice. In ranked-choice voting, people can list multiple candidates, in order of preference. If your first choice isn’t among the top two vote-getters, your later choices start to matter. And the method has been catching on in recent years. Australia, Britain, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand all use it for some elections. The state of Maine has also started using it, and a congressional race last year turned on voters’ second choices. Now there is another way in which ranked choice could be useful: Solving the Brexit mess.Brexit is at a standstill because none of the options has the support of a majority of Parliament (or, it seems, of the British people). Yesterday, Parliament voted on eight different proposals under which Britain could leave the European Union. None got a majority. Prime Minister Theresa May has even offered to resign if Parliament passes her plan, knowing that would appeal to many members of Parliament. In previous votes, the May plan hasn’t come close to passing.So some observers have begun calling for a ranked-choice solution. In effect, it would winnow down the options to the two most popular and then force Parliament to choose between them. “The great virtue of this voting system,” Partha Dasgupta, a Cambridge University economist, writes in The Financial Times, “is that it results in an outcome that is truly the majority winner.” Part of the idea, as Ian Dunt, the editor of politics.co.uk, has written, is “creating a process where tolerable compromises can be found.”Notably, one of the only proposals that came closest to passing yesterday was a kind of meta option, calling for the British people to get an up-or-down vote on any plan Parliament ultimately passed. It’s a sign of how far Parliament remains from agreeing on the substance of Brexit.I’ll confess to being torn about my hopes here. On the one hand, I think ranked-choice voting is a fair way for Parliament to find the most acceptable version of Brexit. On the other, I wouldn’t mind if Parliament were to find any acceptable version and then put the entire matter before the British public for a re-vote.Related: On the latest episode of “The Argument” podcast, Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and I talk about how to replace the Electoral College, and one option is a national popular vote with ranked choice. We also debate the meaning of the Mueller investigation — and who should be feeling vindicated by it.College diversity, on filmFor anyone interested in economic diversity in higher education — as I am — I recommend a new film that follows three high school students in Brooklyn as they try to navigate the application process. It’s called “Personal Statement” and is directed by Juliane Dressner. It’s available for renting on Amazon or iTunes. The film feels particularly timely in the wake of the college admissions scandal. The experiences of the three students in “Personal Statement” are much closer to the American norm than the elite world of, say, the Georgetown tennis team.One of the film’s students, Enoch Jemmott, who’s now a senior at Queens College, has an Op-Ed in The Times this morning. In it, he describes the hurdles that lower-income students face, from the lack of a single college counselor at many high schools to the byzantine misery of financial aid forms."
"Time and Federer March On as Swiss Claims 101st Career Win - The New York Times
(Reuters) - After Roger Federer racked up career title 101 with a clinical 6-1 6-4 dissection of John Isner at the Miami Open on Sunday, the American defending champion seemed as keen as the crowd for the Swiss to carry on competing for titles.""We all want you to keep playing and never retire,"" gushed Isner after being brushed aside in 63 minutes by the fourth-seeded Swiss.This seems an odd statement from a player who has now been beaten six times by Federer in eight career meetings.A more honest response might have been, ""Roger you have won enough please go away"".Federer has already amassed a record 20 Grand Slam trophies and Miami was his 101st career title leaving him just eight shy of matching Jimmy Connors' all-time mark.The Swiss has said he is not yet thinking about the record and neither is he contemplating retirement.At 37, the retirement question is one that comes up for Federer before every event and after it - win or lose -- as it did in Miami. His answer is always the same, ""Why should I?""The evergreen Federer is healthy, happy and winning. With Sunday's triumph - his fourth in Miami - he is the only player on the ATP or WTA Tour to capture two titles this season.MARVELOUS MARCHIt has been a marvelous March for Federer, starting with a win in Dubai and ending with victory in Miami. It could have been even better with a runner-up spot at Indian Wells having been sandwiched between the two titles.""This is why I am still playing to hopefully win big titles like here in Miami,"" said Federer in a post-match interview. ""It just shows me the process I am going through is the right one. ""I am still able to prioritize all the things in my life the right way.""Federer has discovered the secret to career longevity that other members of the Big Four have not quite figured out.World number one Novak Djokovic, who failed to make the quarter-finals at Miami or Indian Wells, is struggling with off-court issues, Rafa Nadal is again battling knee problems, while Andy Murray is recovering from hip surgery that may have sent him into retirement.And Federer? The Swiss maestro just keeps ticking along like one of his country's famous time pieces.""I am really excited about the transition I was able to make,"" he said. ""With an older body maybe you move differently, you see it with Rafa too, he doesn't chase down the balls the same way he used to so you adjust to that.""Federer listens closely to what his body is saying and after reaching three consecutive finals it is telling him that it is time for a rest before he tackles the European claycourt season for the first time in three years.""The clay is going to be a really interesting challenge for me,"" said the Swiss, who will take four or five weeks off before returning in Madrid.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — For an NFL stadium, it will be a different kind of Sunday showdown: Roger Federer against John Isner.Both won Friday and advanced to the final of the Miami Open, which moved this year to the Dolphins' complex from its longtime Key Biscayne home.Federer dominated a semifinal battle of the ages, beating 19-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov 6-2, 6-4. Defending champion Isner also bested a Canadian teenager, 18-year-old qualifier Felix Auger-Aliassime, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4).Both finalists give the new tournament site a thumbs-up, partly because they've done so well the past week.""The venue is absolutely fantastic,"" said Isner, a big football fan. ""To play in the stadium — the Super Bowl will be here next year — it's pretty amazing.""The atmosphere was lively for both matches, and each time experience triumphed. The age gap with Shapovalov was the largest of the 37-year-old Federer's career, and he used a wide array of shotmaking to take control with two early breaks.""It was a tactical match by me,"" Federer said. ""I'm happy I was able to play with variations.""Seeded No. 4, Federer improved to 17-2 this year. He lost in this month's Indian Wells final to Dominic Thiem and now seeks his fourth Miami Open title.Federer is 5-2 against Isner, but they haven't played each other since 2015.Isner, now 33, won his only ATP Masters title a year ago on Key Biscayne.""It's amazing — I said before the tournament the chances were I would not defend my title,"" Isner said. ""I'm very, very happy.""The 6-foot-10 American hit 21 aces in the semifinal and has 98 in five tournament matches. Federer laughingly said he'll brace for a barrage.""I know what to expect,"" Federer said. ""On Sunday I'll be the goalie and try my very best.""The women's final Saturday will match No. 5 Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic against No. 12 Ashleigh Barty of Australia.The largest stadium crowd of the tournament watched Federer deploy his full repertoire against Shapovalov. That included a lunging stab volley for a winner, a half-volley drop shot for another winner, and a nifty chipped return while Federer held the racket like a flag, strings in front of his face.""He's got every shot mastered,"" said Shapovalov, who considers Federer his idol. ""When he needs a shot, he's going to go for it and he's going to make it. I don't think he has any weaknesses.""Shapovalov will climb to a career-best No. 20 in the rankings despite his defeat.""Denis is a great player,"" Federer said, ""and he will be even better in the future.""Like Shapovalov, Auger-Aliassime came up short in a bid for his first ATP Masters 1000 final. He served for both sets, but Isner broke each time by taking advantage of double-faults, and then used his big serve to control the tiebreakers.Nine of his 10 sets in the tournament have gone to a tiebreaker, and he has won each one. But Auger-Aliassime figured neither set should have gotten to that point.""It's a chance you can't miss, serving two times for the set,"" he said. ""Just terrible.""Auger-Aliassime, 5-0 previously against top 20 opponents, was the youngest male semifinalist in the tournament's 35-year history. He'll jump to a career-best No. 33 in next week's rankings.But he'll need steadier play at pivotal moments to fulfill his potential as a future Grand Slam champion.Isner lost serve for only the third time in the tournament to fall behind early. Auger-Aliassime served at 5-4 but double-faulted into the net three times, including on break point.There was a repeat in the second set. Auger-Aliassime served at 5-3, double-faulted once and then hit a swinging volley into the net on break point.The teenager blamed nerves.""It's like I caught a virus or something,"" he said. ""I couldn't put a second serve in anymore. That's just very tough to swallow.""Each lapse led to a tiebreaker, where Isner has been unbeatable of late after arriving at Miami with a modest 7-10 record in tiebreakers this year.He finished strong against Auger-Aliassime, whacking three aces in the final tiebreaker, the last on a 140 mph serve that was his fastest of the match.""I'm playing well,"" Isner said. ""Keep it up and see what happens.""___"
"Czech Pliskova and Aussie Barty to Meet in Miami Final - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Karolina Pliskova reached the Miami Open final with an emphatic 7-5 6-1 win over second seed Simona Halep in soggy south Florida on Thursday night.The Czech fifth seed will meet Ashleigh Barty in Saturday's final, after the 12th seeded Australian beat Estonia's Anett Kontaveit 6-3 6-3 in the other semi-final on a day that tested the patience with a seemingly endless number of rain delays.Pliskova and Romanian Halep played a tight first set, which Pliskova eventually clinched with some outstanding court coverage as she used her long reach to chase down a series of shots by Halep that would have been winners against many a player.Suitably buoyed, Pliskova raced through the second set and was on the brink of victory, up 5-0 when another shower sent the players to the locker room as the clock struck midnight.They eventually returned an hour later for Pliskova to close it out in a near-empty arena.Earlier, Barty was forced to wait out an hour-long rain delay before her match and when it started she and 21st seed Kontaveit were only on the court for about five minutes before weather halted play again.They returned about two-and-a-half hours later to play one more game and then headed back to the locker room for a third rain delay, this time for two hours.Barty finally secured the win with an ace on her second match point, six-and-a-half hours after the original scheduled start. ""I have been here for 12 hours today, but really happy with the way I was able to come out after the rain delays and kind of get on the front foot pretty early,"" said Barty, 22, who has three career titles.""I did the best with what I had and was able to get out of some tight service games at crucial times and get a bit of a roll on.""

"Federer Downs Injured Isner in Miami for 101st Career Title - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Roger Federer defeated a hobbling John Isner 6-1 6-4 for his 101th career title at the Miami Open on Sunday.Holder Isner struggled to continue late in the second set, hampered by pain in his left foot. Federer, who won his fourth Miami title, broke Isner three times in a blazing opening set.""It was a dream start, relaxing my nerves,"" the Swiss, 37, said in a courtside interview.But the American fought back in the second, leveling the set at 3-3 and 4-4 before the pain made it difficult to continue. Federer took the final two games for the victory. ""What a week its been for me,"" said the fourth seed. ""I'm just so happy right now. It's unbelievable. I played here in 1999 for the first time and here I am in 2019. It means a lot to me.""Only American Jimmy Connors, with 109, has more career singles titles than Federer.Isner began to feel pain in the first set.""I started feeling some pain on the top of my foot, and it didn't go away. It only kept getting worse,"" he said. ""I have never had anything like this before, ever.""MASTER FEDEREREven before the injury slowed the seventh-seeded American, Federer was the master, tempering Isner's big serves and winning 32 of 35 points on his own serve""Roger was too good,"" Isner said. ""In the first five games, I was fine. Nothing was bothering me. He was all over me.""Federer elected to receive to open the match and the strategy paid off as he broke Isner.The American held on the third game but Federer took the next four.Isner played much better in the second set but in the end the pain became too much, even with a medical examination after the seventh game.""I knew at 3-4, whatever, I knew I wasn't going to win. I can tell you that much,"" said Isner.""Which is a weird feeling, you know, being on serve in the finals of a match and knowing that I wasn't going to win.""Federer also sensed the American was in trouble.""I knew it was going to be something that was not right. The way he was moving was not well,"" Federer said.""But at the same time I have got to make him work hard, keep doing my things."" The title was Federer's second of the year, coming after his historic 100th win in Doha in February. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Ken Ferris)"
"Robert Kraft’s Other Problem: Soccer - The New York Times
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Robert K. Kraft’s New England Patriots are a very good football team, having won six Super Bowl championships the past 19 years. They are 33-5 against the A.F.C. East division rival Buffalo Bills during that span.In a cruel twist of fate, Robert Kraft’s other team that plays at Gillette Stadium, the New England Revolution, might as well be the Buffalo Bills of Major League Soccer. There was a run of dominance — four M.L.S. Cup Finals appearances in six years — without a championship, and a mostly fallow period now going on a decade. The team is below .500 (125-148-89) since 2008, the year after it went to its third straight M.L.S. Cup Finals.Kraft has bigger concerns at the moment than the Revolution. He is facing two misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. (Kraft denies illegal activity.) Kraft most likely won’t face jail time, but the charges could result in a fine or a suspension or both from the National Football League, where he has become one of the most powerful owners, and from Major League Soccer, where he also enjoys a long, close relationship with the commissioner.If his attention turns back to his soccer team, he is likely to find a house in the middle of a major overhaul.“One of our strategies last year was to instill a new culture at the club,” said Brad Friedel, the former United States national team goalkeeper hired to turn around the team last year. He said a tear-down had been necessary. “We felt that there needed to be a completely different work ethic.”Friedel spoke before the Revolution’s home opener last weekend, a 2-0 loss to the Columbus Crew. He praised his team’s recent signings, but he didn’t hesitate to criticize the team he took over. “We needed leaders,” he said. “We didn’t have a lot of leaders last year.”There is no Tom Brady here.The Revolution began play in 1996, as one of Major League Soccer’s 10 original teams. Kraft, alongside Lamar Hunt and Philip Anschutz, recruited Don Garber from the N.F.L. to be the league’s commissioner, and that tight group helped keep M.L.S. afloat in the early 2000s, when it was on the verge of collapse.But while Kraft has been able to master the N.F.L., the soccer revolution in America has mostly passed him by.The Revolution are one of three M.L.S. teams that still play in cavernous football stadiums. The others, Atlanta United and the Seattle Sounders, justify it by drawing the largest average attendance figures in the league, but only 13,808 fans showed up for the Revolution’s home opener last weekend. The Revolution will draw better when there isn’t snow on the ground, of course, but last year’s average attendance ranked 16th in the league.The team has been trying to build a soccer-specific stadium somewhere in the Boston area since 2006. In the 13 years since, sites have been proposed, millions have been spent on architectural renderings, and plots of land have almost been purchased, all to eventually collapse for one reason or another. A new multimillion-dollar training center will open this season, but that too will be in Foxborough, even as the Boston stadium search goes on.“It’s about getting into a stadium that will transform soccer in our region,” the team president, Brian Bilello, said. “With that in mind, we have been patient, probably to a fault, to try and get the right project done.”In Garber’s mind, most of the Revolution’s problems would be fixed by a new stadium. “My view is their economic model is challenging in Gillette,” he said. “It has not been able to tap into the young, millennial sports fan in the Boston metropolitan area because it is further away.”The couple hundred die-hard Revolution fans tailgating in the parking lot before the home opener weren’t so sure. The stadium search has gone on for so long that they rarely get their hopes up anymore. A number of them said that it feels as if the Revolution are a distant priority for the Krafts.Bilello and Garber deny that is the case. Still, the N.F.L. is a $15 billion-a-year league, and a social, financial and cultural presence far bigger than M.L.S. Kraft sits on some of the N.F.L.’s most powerful committees. His son, Jonathan Kraft, holds those roles on M.L.S. committees and seems to handle most of the team’s day-to-day business.Last year, the Krafts spent $20 million to buy their third team, the Boston Uprising, an e-sports team that competes in the Overwatch League. The sardonic joke among some Revolution supporters is that now they’re not even the neglected second child, but something even worse: the ignored middle child.The team declined to make either Robert or Jonathan Kraft available for this article.Over the years, the Revolution have dabbled in signing higher-priced players, but none has proved a particularly large draw or game-changing addition on the field. The team now wants to give young homegrown players, like Isaac Angking, Nicolas Firmino and Justin Rennicks, a real pathway to first team minutes and success.This off-season, the team also acquired Carles Gil, a Spanish midfielder Friedel hopes will jump-start the attack, along with other players who figure to make an impact, like Edgar Castillo and Juan Fernando Caicedo. Bilello said that the team’s spending on players had been ramping up and that the Krafts were giving the team all the money it needed to compete; both Bilello and Friedel promised that another designated player — the league’s highest salary classification — would arrive in either May or July, once contractual issues could be worked out. They would not reveal the player’s identity.The team is also building a new $35 million training center adjacent to Gillette Stadium that will house both the first team and the academy. The center will feature a number of grass and artificial turf training pitches — the team’s current training pitch is covered in snow, so it has been practicing at Gillette Stadium — and the state-of-the-art facilities that, team officials hope, will help persuade new players to join.Soccer is soccer, though, and building a winning team is mostly the same the world over. The thing that makes M.L.S. unique, according to Friedel, who spent nearly two decades playing in England and other top European leagues, is that it is constantly evolving.“Whether there is a new rule, a new stadium, a new training ground, other new designated players, a new club, a new franchise, a new second division, a new third division,” he said, ticking off the list of possibilities, “all these things happened in this country because the league is growing.”The last four M.L.S. Cups have been won by teams that weren’t original league members, and the last few years have witnessed a steady expansion of the league. When M.L.S. fans think of the most exciting teams now, they are often thinking of bright new teams with bright new stadiums with bright young stars, clubs like Atlanta United and Los Angeles F.C.“At times it is easier to be new, and it is easier to be a new and improved, than it is to be a legacy business,” Garber said.In New England, they know how true this is."
"Finding Fraternity and Politics in Algerian Soccer - The New York Times
Arms raised high. Crowds united in song. Riot police armed with batons. These images could have been taken at political rallies or protests. But they weren’t. They were from soccer matches in northwestern Algeria.The sport is so popular in the North African nation and the region, that it’s been given the Marxist treatment: “We call it the opium of the people,” Fethi Sahraoui said. Since 2015, Mr. Sahraoui has photographed roughly 30 games in his hometown, Mascara, and in neighboring Relizane. The result is “Stadiumphilia.”During soccer season — which runs from late August until the end of May — young men storm stadiums to watch local teams face off in biweekly matches. Unlike those fans, Mr. Sahraoui isn’t concerned with the athletes. He turns his lens toward the surrounding commotion, the fervent faces in the stands.The atmosphere is electric, to say the least. Algerian law prohibits anyone under 18 to enter the stadiums without a guardian, Mr. Sahraoui said. But that doesn’t stop young boys from trying to jump over fences to see the action.On the surface, the takeaway is that Algerians are soccer fanatics. But Mr. Sahraoui sees beyond the entertainment. He says the stadiums have become platforms for young men to find a sense of brotherhood and to escape the pressures of daily life. After spending years among those crowds, he adds, he can’t help but link the energy of those games to current protests.In February, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced that he would run for a fifth term. Algerians had been living under his rule for 20 years, and they had had enough. Thousands of demonstrators have been taking to the streets demanding his resignation, citing problems like corruption and stifling unemployment.Life is particularly rough for Algerian youth. According to the International Monetary Fund, the unemployment rate among Algerians between the ages of 15 and 24 is more than 28 percent. And a third of youth are either unemployed or not in school. “We need to admit that what’s happening in Algeria, this popular movement or popular uprising, it’s orchestrated mainly by youth,” Mr. Sahraoui said.He feels that before the protests, young Algerians took out their frustrations in the soccer stadiums. Their songs and chants were highly political and socially conscious: They would imagine better lives or call for local politicians to step down. Some would sing tribute songs to friends who had perished trying to cross the Mediterranean, Mr. Sahroui said.Politics has long been intertwined with the sport. In one image, a boy peers out from behind a poster of Zougari Taher, a man who died during the Algerian war for independence from France in the 1950s and ’60s. Locals herald Mr. Taher as a martyr, and the stadium in Relizane is named after him.With the recent protests, Algerians have turned to the streets. “I’m happy for them because it’s a larger space and a lot of people are hearing them and paying attention to them,” Mr. Sahraoui said. The streets also allows for more unity. Women have openly taken part in the demonstrations, while soccer has always been a “manly” sport in the country, Mr. Sahraoui said. He wanted this essay to focus on young fans, and most if not all of those happened to be boys.Mr. Sahraoui couldn’t exactly see himself in those youngsters. Growing up, his family thought the games were dangerous and prohibited him from going. “Working on this project, it was like a delayed exploration of this universe,” he said. “I went there as a photographer, but there was the young child who was inside me.”Fun fact: These images — and all of his personal projects — were taken with smartphones. But he says if no one notices, “it’s a good sign.” He feels at ease with the device. Plus, carrying a larger digital camera would have drawn the curiosity of riot police, while a phone helped him blend in with the crowds.“I think that a photographer will remain a photographer,” he said. “Even with an iPhone.”Follow @nytimesphoto and @_SaraAridi on Twitter.

"In Soccer’s Biggest Elections, Accusations Are Common but Challengers Are Not - The New York Times
Soccer officials from one of FIFA’s largest confederations have gathered this week in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to elect a president. The balloting will take place at the end of a long day of speeches, motions and reports, but at least the setting — the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel — promises to be comfortable.Before the vote is held, the incumbent, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, will have the opportunity to make a speech outlining his qualifications. His opponent will not.That is because, as usual, there is no opponent.For the third time in less than a year — the fourth will come in June — one of soccer’s largest and most powerful governing bodies will rubber-stamp the election of its leader in a one-candidate election. South America’s governing body, Conmebol, went first last May, when it granted President Alejandro Domínguez an unopposed second term, and Europe’s governing body, UEFA, followed suit in February by re-electing Aleksandr Ceferin. In June, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, will retain his post in yet another walkover.“There has always seemed to be a great deal of fear around challenging the incumbent and because of the potential for retribution built into the system,” said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. For that reason, she said, regular uncontested elections are “not all that surprising.”Wrage previously advised FIFA on corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization’s most vocal critics.In Asia, Sheikh Salman had been challenged — briefly — by opponents from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, two countries at the center of a broad political dispute that has spilled into soccer in a variety of ways, but both dropped out of the race late last month after a series of behind-the-scenes meetings in the Gulf.Sheikh Salman’s presidency has been marred by controversy since he was elected in 2013 to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam, a wealthy Qatari businessman who was banned for life in the wake of a corruption investigation. His connections to Bahrain’s royal family, for example, have led to Sheikh Salman’s recusing himself from a role in some of the Asian Football Confederation’s most sensitive decisions, such as in the highly publicized case of Hakeem al-Araibi, a soccer player who fled to Australia after claiming he had been tortured by the Bahraini government during pro-democracy demonstrations there in 2011.Salman also did not take part in discussions over how to deal with the pirating of the A.F.C.’s Qatari broadcast partner’s programing by an illegal operation based in Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is among the countries backing the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar.The re-election of incumbents, routinely without opposition, is common in soccer, where the power structures remain closely held despite a sprawling investigation in 2015 by the United States Department of Justice that exposed corruption schemes at the highest levels of the sport dating back decades.The American case largely avoided implicating officials in Asia, but by then regional soccer leaders had already faced a reckoning after a series of internal investigations into the conduct of Sheikh Salman’s predecessor, Bin Hammam, and his leadership team. Those reports, including one by the former F.B.I. chief Louis Freeh, exposed a series of unexplained payments made to soccer officials throughout Asia and Africa.The reports, three in total, which have been reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of payments made on behalf of Bin Hammam by the A.F.C.’s longtime media partner, World Sports Group, and specifically its regional head, the Lebanese businessman Pierre Kakhia. The payments included legal fees for an official from Tahiti who was facing an ethics ban, and money to a consulting firm hired to promote Bin Hammam’s bid for the FIFA presidency.Despite his links to Bin Hammam, Kakhia remains a trusted consultant to the A.F.C., currently responsible for handling millions of dollars worth of sponsorship contracts, even though he last worked for W.S.G.’s parent company in 2016.The A.F.C. declined to say why it had retained the services of Kakhia.As well as Sheikh Salman’s re-election, delegates at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur will pick candidates for coveted places on global soccer’s ruling body, the FIFA Council. That contest, featuring eight candidates vying for six places, has proved to be contentious.South Korean officials have complained to the A.F.C. over perceived double standards in ethics rules after their country was barred from inviting soccer officials to Seoul to attend an exhibition game last month, a prohibition that was not extended to Qatar, which wrote to officials inviting them on an all-expenses paid trip to attend two matches there. Both South Korea and Qatar have candidates in the election, as does the Philippines, whose candidate, the South Koreans contend, has been using a private jet owned by a Qatari official to travel across the region during his campaign.“We urgently request you to review this matter in relation to any violation against the relevant regulations in force,” the Korean soccer federation president, Chong Mong-gyu, wrote in a letter to the A.F.C. The A.F.C., which confirmed it had received the South Koreans’ complaint, declined to say why it had not issued the same warning to Qatar.Sheikh Salman’s challengers dropped out of the presidential race after a series of decisions by the A.F.C., including the surprising move to break an exclusive television contract with the A.F.C.’s broadcast partner, the Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports, in order to allow games to be broadcast in Saudi Arabia, where games have been broadcast illegally for almost two years. BeIN said it planned to sue the A.F.C. over the decision.Until that decision, Saudi Arabia had been supporting an Emirati candidate, Mohammad Khalfan al-Rumaithi. Rumaithi withdrew his candidacy shortly after the television agreement was struck. The third candidate, Saoud al-Mohannadi of Qatar, soon followed suit."
"U.S. Soccer Invites South American Teams for Rich New Tournament in 2020 - The New York Times
U.S. Soccer has invited South America’s 10 soccer federations to bring their national teams to the United States in 2020 for a new intercontinental championship that would run concurrently with that summer’s European Championship.The offer, a package that includes almost $200 million in guarantees to the invited teams and their governing bodies, was made Tuesday in a letter from U.S. Soccer’s president, Carlos Cordeiro, to his counterparts at the 10 South American federations. For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents, but with no agreement in sight, U.S. Soccer, eager to fill a gap in the global soccer calendar and bearing an enticing nine-figure offer, is now proposing to establish its own.In the letter, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation — and both confederations — millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Cordeiro has invited the South Americans to a meeting to discuss the proposal next week in Miami.The proposed 16-team tournament would resemble, in structure though most likely not in name, the 2016 Copa América Centenario. That tournament, a relocated version of the South American championship — expanded to celebrate the event’s 100th anniversary — brought the 10 members of the South American confederation, Conmebol, to the United States for a month to face off not only against one another, but also a half-dozen opponents from Concacaf, the regional confederation made up of North and Central America and the Caribbean.That tournament was considered a sporting and — perhaps more important — a financial success, and was won by Chile, which beat Argentina in a penalty-kick shootout in the final in East Rutherford, N.J. The new event would take place in June and July next year.The proposed 2020 tournament would again include all 10 South American teams, plus six from Concacaf, and would most likely feature a group stage and then a knockout round to determine a champion. U.S. Soccer’s role in the offer, and Concacaf’s consent, would be critical to making the event happen, since both would have to approve any plans to hold such an event in the United States.Concacaf released a statement Tuesday night acknowledging receipt of Cordeiro’s overture and expressing support for its broad strokes: “We view this opportunity positively as it is not intended to replace or substitute any future editions of the Concacaf Gold Cup and it complements our vision to continue providing opportunities for our Member Associations to play competitive football at the highest level.”In his letter, a draft of which was seen by The New York Times, Cordeiro took pains to emphasize that the new event would be a singular tournament, and not meant to replace existing events like the Copa América or the Gold Cup, which would continue separately. Conmebol, which will contest this year’s Copa in June and July in Brazil, said last year that it was planning to shift the Copa América to a quadrennial schedule starting in 2020, to coincide with UEFA’s European Championship. Concacaf holds its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, in odd-numbered years; this year’s Gold Cup matches will be played in the United States, Costa Rica and at least one Caribbean nation.For next summer, though, Cordeiro is proposing a larger, intercontinental event in the United States. The event could fill a gap in the global soccer calendar — at the moment, the Euros are the only major championship scheduled for that summer — but despite the millions being offered, it is unclear how South American and Conmebol officials will react to a tournament that would conflict with their Copa América plans.The Copa América has included guest teams for years; Mexico and the United States have participated in it several times, and this year it will include Japan and Qatar.For the United States, though, the event could have several positives. FIFA is expected to choose the dozen or so host cities for the 2026 World Cup in the next two years, so the tournament could be a chance for the 17 finalists to make their case for inclusion. It also would offer meaningful competition for the United States men’s national team as it heads into qualifying for the 2022 World Cup; that process began later than hoped because the search for the team’s head coach, Gregg Berhalter, was delayed, first by the World Cup bid and then by the search for a general manager to run the national team program. Hired in December, Berhalter has coached only two friendlies to date as he prepares for this summer’s Gold Cup.If the proposed tournament with Conmebol does not come to fruition, U.S. Soccer could still press ahead with a new event, possibly a scaled-down tournament involving teams from other continents."
"Hacker Who Leaked Soccer’s Secrets Loses Extradition Hearing - The New York Times
A computer hacker who for years published the innermost secrets of the global soccer industry — revelations that have shed light on questionable behavior by some of the sport’s most influential figures and top clubs — was told on Tuesday that he would be extradited to Portugal, where he faces charges linked to his activities.Lawyers for the man, Rui Pinto, 30, immediately said they planned to appeal the decision made by a court in Budapest, where he was arrested in January. They argued that his whistle-blowing activities far outweighed any crimes he might have committed in securing the documents. In Portugal, Mr. Pinto is charged with an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.The leaks first emerged in 2015, on a website called Football Leaks, before Mr. Pinto, a year later, joined with the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and a group of other European news media organizations to slowly disseminate related news articles. They painted an unflattering picture of an industry troubled by questionable efforts to avoid millions of dollars in tax, flagrant rule breaking by some top clubs and an alleged sexual assault by one of soccer’s biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo.While the Portuguese authorities want to put Mr. Pinto on trial, their counterparts in France and Belgium have said they want to work with him, to gain access to the enormous database he has compiled as they continue investigations into figures in the soccer world. The ruling in Hungary makes that difficult, said Francisco Teixeira da Mota, who is part of a legal team that includes William Bourdon, a French lawyer who previously represented the national security whistle-blower Edward Snowden.Hungarian officials seized all of Mr. Pinto’s computer equipment, including hard drives containing the soccer industry data, when he was arrested. The Hungarian judge ruled that all of that can be sent to Portuguese authorities. That will chill efforts by the authorities in other countries, and make it impossible for further revelations to emerge, Mr. Teixeira da Mota said.“We think if he’s extradited to Portugal it would put a stop to all that,” he said, adding that the Portuguese case is limited to Mr. Pinto’s conduct in relation to the investment fund Doyen Sports and the soccer team Sporting Clube de Portugal.It is not clear how much of the data Der Spiegel possesses and how much of it the news weekly is prepared to share with investigators.While being hailed as a whistle-blower by many, Mr. Pinto’s past conduct has raised questions about his motives. He reached an out-of-court settlement with the Caledonian Bank after being accused of hacking into its systems and transferring thousands of dollars from one of its client accounts. Mr. Pinto denies he stole any of the money, but citing a nondisclosure agreement, he has declined to provide further details.As he awaits his fate, news media groups with access to his data continue to publish new revelations. As recently as last weekend, details emerged of an apparent effort by the Premier League giant Manchester City to circumvent fiscal rules set by European soccer’s governing body by disguising sponsorship payments, and another alleged scheme by the same club to run an off-the-books player recruitment fund.Mr. Pinto’s appeal is likely to take up to two weeks to be settled, his lawyer said."

MYSLENICE, Poland — The dark, uneven soil at Wisla Krakow’s training facility in this village 40 minutes south of Poland’s second largest city was frozen solid last month as a few hundred supporters trudged through the snow to greet Jakub Blaszczykowski.Blaszczykowski, a 33-year-old midfielder, has played in some of soccer’s biggest matches, including the 2013 Champions League final as a member of Borussia Dortmund, two European championships, and a World Cup with Poland’s national team.But on this January afternoon, Blaszczykowski was a long way from those moments. Instead, he was about to play his first exhibition game since rejoining Wisla Krakow, one of Poland’s most decorated teams. Wisla is the club Blaszczykowski made his name with, and the team he had promised to someday return to when he signed with Dortmund in 2007.He was not returning to ease into retirement, though, or for a final payday. In fact, the opposite was true: Blaszczykowski, known as Kuba, had come home in an unusual deal in which he agreed to take virtually no money to play and to join with two Polish investors to lend the club 1.33 million zloty (about $350,000) to cover his new teammates’ unpaid wages.The Wisla Krakow he rejoined, he knew, was in dire straits, its proud history besmirched after a series of disastrous events involving a hooligan takeover, missing money and a mysterious foreign investor who offered himself as a savior, collected the club’s ownership certificates and then — without producing even a single zloty — disappeared.Wisla Krakow’s problems were years in the making. But they started to accelerate in 2016, when the team’s longtime owner, Boguslaw Cupial, decided to sell the club.Cupial had been one of Poland’s postcommunist success stories, earning millions through his cable company, Tele-Fonika. In 1997, he invested some of his fortune in Wisla, transforming the club into an eight-time league champion under his stewardship. But Cupial took a big hit in the 2008 global financial crisis and in 2016 sold the money-losing club to a local buyer.That buyer promptly flipped the club to TS Wisla, a supporter-friendly umbrella organization that already controlled Wisla Krakow’s other sports teams. The businessman, it turned out, had no money, said Michal Trela, a reporter for Przeglad Sportowy, a Polish sports daily. “After one month,” Trela said, “the supporters bought the club back for 1 zloty” — around 25 cents.In an age of superrich foreign owners in soccer, a sale that actually gave fans a say in the running of their club should have been refreshing. But at Wisla, the purchase appeared to hand control to a group of soccer hooligans called the Sharks.“Almost every club in Poland has a problem with hooligans,” said Szymon Jadczak, an investigative reporter for the Polish television network TVN. “But in Wisla, the hooligans were the club.”The Sharks have a loud, intimidating presence at Wisla’s stadium and in 2015 a group of them made headlines when they were photographed giving the Nazi salute while in Rome to watch Roma play Lazio. Now they were calling the shots at Wisla Krakow, under the leadership of Pawel Michalski, who had served more than six years in prison for throwing a knife from the stands at an Italian player during a UEFA Cup match. Through TS Wisla, Michalski was able to ensure that two people with close connections to the Sharks were put in charge of the club, and contracts for everything from cleaning the stadium to printing the match-day programs were signed with friends and associates at what were viewed as inflated rates. The club, Jadczak said, became a “sort of cash machine” for people connected to the Sharks’ leadership.When questions were raised, the Wisla president installed after the Sharks’ takeover, Marzena Sarapata, held a news conference to dismiss the claims that the hooligan group effectively controlled the club. But a few months later, an arrest warrant was issued for Michalski, whom the police charged with heading a criminal group and with having involvement in the drug trade. Shortly afterward, Poland’s Central Bureau of Investigation undertook a series of raids in which they arrested dozens of hooligans. Michalski left Poland.Jadczak’s televised investigation about the takeover and mismanagement at Wisla — broadcast by TVN in September — was the last straw; the club’s top officials resigned, and the city of Krakow persuaded Poland’s soccer authorities to send any money owed to the club to the city instead, to cover unpaid rent at a city-owned stadium. Michalski was eventually arrested in Italy; he will stand trial later this year.  Sarapata did not respond to phone calls or messages from The New York Times but did give an interview to a website owned by the same Polish betting company that sponsors Wisla and denied all the allegations. Meanwhile, the video clips of hooligans being arrested and of searches at TS Wisla’s headquarters made finding a new investor for the club difficult. And the unpaid players merely fell into line with the other debtors. Wisla needed a savior.In December, it thought it had found one. A French-Cambodian businessman named Vanna Ly, who claimed to have extensive investments in soccer clubs around the world, announced he would be purchasing 60 percent of Wisla Krakow. The rest would be owned by Noble Capital Partners, a British investment firm represented by a Swedish businessman, Mats Hartling. The deal was reported to be for 12 million zloty ($3.2 million).Ly arrived in Krakow to watch a game and began to meet people connected to the club. Invariably, they knew little about him beyond his name and his promise to invest. “I met Vanna Ly, he’s real, he exists,” said Rafal Wislocki, one of the few team officials untainted by association with the Sharks. “He has ID. I saw this ID. French ID.”Ly, Wislocki and other club officials took in a 1-0 league defeat against Lech Poznan on Dec. 21. It was the last game before the winter break, and Wisla Krakow, despite the crisis, sat a creditable eighth in the 16-team Polish league. Ly made clear that he was not impressed with the standard of play, Wislocki said, but at least sounded as if he knew how to run a soccer club. “He knew the answer when I asked difficult questions,” Wislocki said.The purchase contract was signed, though in hindsight, team officials said, even then something was awry: Despite claiming to control millions of dollars, Ly arrived in Krakow on a budget airline, and when he was spotted leaving Krakow’s city hall after a meeting, he attempted to hide from reporters under a black umbrella. The bulk of the money to pay off the team’s debts was due a few days later, but it never arrived. At first, Ly told Wisla officials that his phone had been stolen, preventing him from sending the cash. Later, they were told that Ly had had a heart attack on his private jet as it flew to New York.Ly was never heard from again. Despite repeated attempts by The Times to contact him by email and by phone, he did not respond. After initially hanging up the phone, Hartling emailed a one-line reply: “Ly is a criminal who will be pursued accordingly.”Asked about Ly in a text message, Adam Pietrowski, the player agent who had brought Hartling to Wisla and was briefly club president, replied with an emoji: a sad face with a Pinocchio nose.By then, Wisla Krakow had bigger problems than a missing investor. European soccer’s midseason transfer window would open Jan. 1, and with the club’s license to play suspended because of its grim financial state, and with its unpaid players likely to depart, Wisla had only a few weeks to stabilize its affairs.Wislocki, who had successfully run the team’s youth academy, was appointed club president. Blaszczykowski, out of favor at his German club, Wolfsburg, suggested he would consider a return. In January, he and the two investors he had joined forces with delivered a vital infusion of cash to cover the team’s back wages. Still, he delayed his full commitment to play until the restoration of Wisla’s license was assured.In the end, Wisla sold eight members of its squad in January, but the payment from Blaszczykowski, as well as the promise of playing alongside a player revered in Poland, stemmed the hemorrhaging of talent.“Kuba gives us belief that we can make this club great again,” Wislocki said.A few days after his first exhibition match, Blaszczykowski trotted onto the freezing field in Myslenice again as a large crowd sung his name. If anything, it was even colder. Again Wisla lost, again by 3-2, and again a crowd gathered by the entrance to the training ground in hopes of taking a photograph with Kuba.As the second half of that game began, word arrived that Wisla’s most urgent crisis was over: The league had restored the team’s license, allowing it to sell tickets to its remaining games. Wislocki announced that the club was selling 5 percent of its shares to fans; in less than 24 hours, the offer raised 4 million zloty (a little more than $1 million). Blaszczykowski eventually signed his contract, although league rules prevented him from playing for free. Instead, he’ll donate his 500 zloty minimum wage ($130) to a local children’s home. And he finally made his league debut in a 2-0 defeat against Gornik Zabrze last week. A new owner still needs to be found — without one, said Trela, the journalist, “it will be impossible to get a new license for next season” — but Wisla is breathing a little easier.Its coach, the former Poland international Maciej Stolarczyk, who took the job last summer, has known only chaos and financial crisis at the club. He, too, had met Ly, whose bold promises, he said, had been magnified by the Polish news media. “They said we will be another Manchester City in Poland!” Stolarczyk said, laughing. “But I want to say the team didn’t believe everything they were told.”His only concern now is the second half of the season. Having one of Poland’s best players is a bonus, he said, but he is acutely aware of the weight that Blaszczykowski carries. “Everyone will be looking at him, everyone will be talking about him, and also all the rivals will try to stop him,” Stolarczyk said. “So our task is to try and protect him.”Long after the final whistle of his first game back, Blaszczykowski did not seem to need protection. He was standing stone-faced as he signed every shirt that was handed to him and posed for every selfie. He was why parents had brought their children out in the biting cold to press against the fence, to squint into the low winter sun. He was why Wisla fans had hope again.“We love Kuba,” one man said. “Kuba is our hero.”"
"Players Say Soccer Chief Sexually Abused Them for Years. He May Still Win. - The New York Times
KABUL, Afghanistan — He was their nightmare, the young, female Afghan soccer players say: a menacing 57-year-old with two wives who locked the door to his back office with a biometric keypad that only he could open.Many of those young soccer players, members of the women’s national team, lined up to accuse the man, the president of Afghan soccer, Keramuddin Keram, of sexually assaulting them in a bed he kept in that room, and elsewhere, charges they made both in public statements and to Afghan prosecutors. Women who rebuffed his advances were labeled lesbians and expelled from the team, according to eight former players who said that had happened to them.Three months later, however, the investigation into sexual abuse in Afghan soccer is stalled, amid fears it will never proceed. It has yet to result in any criminal charges.One of Mr. Keram’s accusers, the soccer player Khalida Popal, said he had actively pursued women who testified against him in Afghanistan, warning them to withdraw the charges. And witnesses like her who live in exile have not been interviewed in person by Afghan investigators, as required by law, because so far the investigators have not been able to get visas.Mr. Keram remains the president of the Afghanistan Football Federation, which is in charge of men’s and women’s soccer, the country’s most popular sport, although he is suspended by order of the attorney general. And FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, has just extended Mr. Keram’s ban from participating in national and international soccer for three more months, as its own investigation, nearly a year old, grinds on.Neither FIFA nor Mr. Keram responded to requests for comment.Despite public support from President Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan investigation has run into a powerful lobby made up of supporters of Mr. Keram from Panjshir, a politically dominant province in northern Afghanistan. Once a local warlord and later governor of the province, Mr. Keram remains well connected with the Jamiat-i-Islami party, the major political force in the north.Prosecutors have the power to arrest Mr. Keram but have not done so, though they have blocked him from leaving the country. “If the investigative committee thinks they need to arrest him, they will do so,” said Jamshid Rasooli, the attorney general’s spokesman.Mr. Rasooli confirmed a report by ToloNews, an Afghan television news program, that two of the attorney general’s investigators had not yet obtained visas to interview witnesses in Europe, which has led to speculation that the visas were denied for fear that the investigators would claim asylum themselves. He said they had been waiting for the visas for more than a month.Ms. Popal, 31, reached by telephone in Denmark, said she had heard from at least three soccer players in the past two months who withdrew their charges against Mr. Keram after they received direct, personal threats from him.Two of the women answered calls from someone they knew, who then handed the phone to Mr. Keram. In the third case, the woman was walking to soccer practice in Kabul near the football federation offices when she was forced into a car with blacked-out windows, finding Mr. Keram inside, Ms. Popal was told.“He told them, ‘I know you have been to the attorney general’s office and given testimony against us,’ ” Ms. Popal said. “ ‘Go and take back the testimony. You know I am a powerful person. Nobody will put me in jail. I will win this case. It’ll take some time, but then what will happen to you? Think about your future and what will happen to you and your family.’ ”Ms. Popal said the three women, whom she declined to identify for their safety, had gone into hiding and were no longer willing to testify against Mr. Keram.Mr. Keram did not respond to repeated efforts to contact him for comment. A spokesman for the Afghan federation, Shafi Shadab, who had earlier spoken on behalf of Mr. Keram, said Saturday that the attorney general had ordered him to have no further contact with the soccer chief. The federation’s Facebook page has posted a statement denying all of the charges.Ms. Popal was one of the founders of women’s soccer in Afghanistan and remained active with the team after fleeing to Denmark, where she claimed asylum in 2011. She accused Mr. Keram of the rape and sexual assault of other players and claimed to have evidence that she had reported those claims to the federation early last year with no response.“The president of A.F.F. and some trainers are raping and sexually harassing female players,” she said in a December interview. She earlier made similar claims in an interview with The Guardian.In addition to Mr. Keram, four other members of the federation were suspended and banned from travel. The ban on one of them, the federation’s deputy president, Yosuf Kargar, was lifted in January after the attorney general’s office said it had found no evidence against him.Mr. Keram appealed his suspension by FIFA but was denied.Earlier, the sponsor of the Afghan national women’s team, the Danish sportswear manufacturer Hummel, withdrew its financial support over what it called “strong allegations of severe mental, physical, sexual and equal rights abuse of the female players by male A.F.F. officials.”Last month, Kelly Lindsey, the American coach of the Afghan women’s team, urged FIFA to step in and take more concrete action. It could, for instance, ban the Afghan teams from competition.“I think FIFA really needs to stand up here. They are the governing body of football and if they allow this to happen in their culture, then it’s easy for it to be pushed under the rug,” she said in an interview with Reuters.FIFA has defended its actions, noting that it suspended Mr. Keram and is investigating the allegations. It added that it had “zero tolerance” for sexual abuse. Last week, FIFA said the head of its investigation had requested that Mr. Keram’s ban be extended for 90 days, and that the organization had agreed.“During this time, Mr. Karim will continue to be banned from all football-related activities at both national and international level,” it said, using an alternative transliteration of Mr. Keram’s name.Human Rights Watch weighed in last month, urging both FIFA and the Afghan authorities to move more decisively on their investigations. “FIFA, which said it began investigating these allegations last April, should share information with Afghan investigators and maintain a ban on accused officials,” the rights group said.Mr. Rasooli said the Afghan attorney general was determined to fully pursue the case against Mr. Keram and the others accused. They have not been arrested, he said, because under Afghan law that would limit the time the authorities had to conduct their investigation.“This is a complicated case,” he said. “We have interviewed 30 witnesses inside Afghanistan and that part of the case is almost completed.”He added that the authorities still hoped to obtain European visas for investigators.Ms. Popal said she was still hopeful that the investigation of Mr. Keram and his colleagues would succeed.“I really respect and trust the committee in the attorney general’s office working on this case,” she said. “At the same time, I don’t know how powerful they are once the case is out of their hands. And he is a powerful guy, with so much influence inside the government.”"
"Conmebol Rejects U.S. Soccer’s Offer for New Tournament - The New York Times
South America’s top soccer official on Thursday rejected an invitation to take part in a proposed intercontinental tournament hosted and financed by U.S. Soccer in the summer of 2020, saying the continent’s governing body preferred to maintain the primacy of its own continental championship, the Copa América.U.S. Soccer President Carlos Cordeiro had made the offer for a combined tournament featuring South America’s 10 teams and six from the region comprising North and Central America and the Caribbean in a letter earlier this week. U.S. Soccer’s offer would have been worth tens of millions of dollars for the South American teams, their regional rivals who took part, and the two confederations governing soccer in the Americas.But in a letter to Cordeiro dated Wednesday, first reported by the Brazilian news outlet Globo, the president of the South American federation, Alejandro Dominguez, categorically rejected the invitation to a proposed Continental Cup in 2020. Dominguez’s letter cited a lack of FIFA approval for the new event, but also a preference to prioritize the Copa América, which is the oldest international soccer championship in the world.Last year, officials from the South American confederation, Conmebol, announced plans to shift the Copa América to a quadrennial schedule starting in the summer of 2020.But U.S. Soccer, frustrated by a lack of progress in talks for a combined international tournament, invited South America’s 10 soccer federations to take part in a 16-team championship held in the United States. The framework of the new tournament would have been similar to the 2016 Copa América Centenario, a one-time tournament celebrating the event’s 100th anniversary that was a financial and sporting success. U.S. Soccer sweetened its offer for 2020 with nearly $200 million in guarantees to the visiting teams and their confederations.In his letter inviting the South Americans, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation — and both confederations — millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Conmebol and its northern neighbor, Concacaf, would receive $50 million each to go along. Cordeiro invited Conmebol officials to a meeting in Miami next week to discuss the proposal.U.S. Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Conmebol’s decision to decline the offer.For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents. The Copa América will take place as planned this summer in Brazil, with Japan and Qatar filling the two guest spots often reserved for teams from Concacaf. Concacaf will hold its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, at the same time.If the offer to Conmebol is not revived, U.S. Soccer is expected to press ahead with plans for a scaled-down tournament featuring national teams from other continents, potentially including Africa and Asia."
"A Soccer Pro at 13? Olivia Moultrie Will Give It a Try - The New York Times
Two years ago — in a move that delighted some in women’s sports and shocked others — Olivia Moultrie announced that she had accepted a scholarship offer to play college soccer at the University of North Carolina. She was 11 years old.On Monday, Moultrie, the youngest girls’ soccer player to publicly accept an academic scholarship offer, became the youngest girls’ soccer player to then officially forgo her college athletic eligibility. Now 13, Moultrie announced that she had signed, in short order, a representation deal with the Wasserman Media Group, a sports agency, and a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike. In taking those two actions, Moultrie formally began her professional career.Moultrie’s agent, Spencer Wadsworth, declined to disclose the terms of the Nike deal, except to say that it was worth more financially than a four-year scholarship at a top university, which is generally valued at about $300,000.“It’s just a shift in women’s sports,” Wadsworth said. “You see it more and more now where women’s soccer is catching up to the men’s side, and there’s more opportunities for them.”Moultrie has already drawn worldwide attention for her prodigious technical skills and her family’s nontraditional approach to her nascent career. She has long played with older girls on the United States youth national team and with boys’ clubs near her family’s home in Canyon Country, Calif.Last year, Moultrie made multiple trips to Europe to meet and train with some of the continent’s biggest clubs: Olympique Lyon and Paris St.-Germain in France, and Bayern Munich in Germany. And with the help of her father, K.C., she has maintained an active presence on social media, often posting highlight clips to more than 87,000 followers on Instagram.“I feel for literally almost every kid in girls’ soccer, you should go to college; there’s not a million dollars at the end of the rainbow,” K.C. Moultrie said in an interview with The New York Times last year. “I think if you’re truly, truly elite, if your goal is to be a world-class player and a pro and, in Olivia’s case, to be the best player in the world, there’s no way it’s better to play college than it is to play full time.”Moultrie’s next step is unclear. A move to Europe is most likely impossible for several years; FIFA rules, with certain exceptions, generally prevent youth prospects from signing with foreign clubs before they turn 18.A far more likely prospect would involve Moultrie’s latching on as a developmental player with a team in the top United States league, the N.W.S.L. But that path has its own obstacles; before she could ever sign a professional contract, the league would essentially have to create new allocation rules to deal with her unique situation. In addition, a player currently must be 18 to play in the N.W.S.L.Moultrie has been on her unconventional path for years. She began intense, soccer-specific training when she was 7 years old, started home schooling as a fifth grader to free her schedule for more soccer, and eventually became the first girl to play for a boys’ club team in the United States Development Academy system. She was 10 when she began attending college showcase camps, and at 11 she accepted a full scholarship offer from North Carolina.That she gave up the scholarship was not a huge surprise. For one thing, sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas had long had Moultrie in their sights. Last year, when she was still an amateur, Nike featured her in a local promotional campaign for one of the company’s soccer cleats. On Sunday night, Moultrie appeared briefly near the end of a Nike commercial that aired during the Academy Awards.Nike, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its deal with Moultrie.Anson Dorrance, the longtime coach at North Carolina who had offered Moultrie a scholarship, said in an interview on Monday that he was pleased Moultrie had signed a deal for what he presumed was a significant amount of money, noting that the vast majority of women’s soccer players still struggle to make a steady living as professionals. He said Moultrie’s deal was a good development for the women’s game.“We knew what was in the water, and we have no issue with this,” Dorrance said about Moultrie’s decision. “We lost a great player to the professional ranks, and we totally support that, if the financial incentives are good.”Though it has long been common for boys in the United States to skip college to pursue soccer careers, it is a move that has so far made sense for only a few girls.Just two members of the current United States women’s national team, for instance, have walked away from college scholarship offers for professional opportunities. Mallory Pugh was 19 when she did it two years ago, joining the N.W.S.L.’s Washington Spirit before ever suiting up for U.C.L.A. In 2012, Lindsey Horan joined P.S.G. at 18 after having accepted a scholarship offer from North Carolina.But in doing so at 13, Moultrie has become an extreme outlier, even if — in all likelihood — it will be years before she has an opportunity to prove herself before a wide audience.Dorrance said her skills were more than sufficient for her to thrive. The one, big question that remained, he said, was how much more she would mature physically.“That’s the risk for any young kid whose ambition is to play at a high level,” Dorrance said, “or for a shoe company that is signing them young or a professional team that is signing them young.”"

"Soccer Pioneers, Priced Out by Progress - The New York Times
ROSSINGTON, England — Over the years, Sheila Edmunds has done pretty much everything for the Doncaster Belles. Half a century ago, she was among the group of friends who founded the club. For 25 years, she wore the team’s No. 8 jersey and, for a while, its captain’s armband.When she retired, she filled in wherever required: welfare officer, first-aid practitioner, physiotherapist. Now her official title is president and general manager. If that sounds like an executive role, an honorary sinecure, it is not.An hour or so before a game at the windswept stadium that the Belles now call home, Edmunds can be found in the simple wooden cabin that passes for a ticket office. At her back is an electric heater, on futile full blast to stave off the bitter cold. She welcomes fans handing over the £5 entrance fee warmly, as if each one is an old friend.In quiet moments, she might help out at the trestle table that serves as the Belles’ merchandising arm. After kickoff, she keeps one eye on the game as she totals up the day’s takings; it is easier this way, she says. She is the one, after all, who will have to enter it all into the club’s accounts later.There is more money in women’s soccer in England than there has ever been. Last summer, the country’s highest tier — the Women’s Super League (W.S.L.) — became, for the first time, fully professional, with a broadcasting arrangement with the BBC. England’s biggest clubs, including Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, all have invested heavily in their women’s teams in recent years, spending not just on homegrown players but for high-profile imports, too. Manchester United, even, has finally joined the fray: It launched its women’s team, in the second-tier Championship, last year, and immediately set about recruiting an all-star roster.The effect has been seismic, not just in terms of results — Manchester City reached the Champions League semifinals the last two seasons and England’s national team finished third in the 2015 Women’s World Cup — but in terms of interest, too. More than 45,000 people attended last season’s women’s F.A. Cup final, and two million more watched it live on television.Little or none of that growth, though, has found its way to Doncaster; or, more accurately, Rossington, a small village on the outskirts of the town, where Doncaster Rovers Belles play their home games in the third tier of English women’s soccer.Crowds rarely number much more than a hundred here. There are no television cameras. Last summer, the club’s biggest sponsor walked away; its income now does not stretch far beyond the cash Edmunds sifts through in front of that electric heater.And yet this is the team that has, arguably, done more for women’s soccer in England than any other, a club that was synonymous with the sport for decades. In the 1980s and early 1990s, long before the professional clubs showed any interest in women’s soccer, the Belles were its pre-eminent force.Between 1983 and 1994, the Belles reached 11 of 12 women’s F.A. Cup finals, and won the trophy six times. The team won the first ever women’s national league title, in 1992, and regained the crown in 1994; it would finish as runners-up seven times in the following years.Back then, its players formed the backbone of the English national team. “At one point, we had seven or eight players in the squad,” said Gillian Coultard, who spent 21 years playing for the Belles in the team’s heyday, and picked up 119 appearances for England. For a long time, she was one of five players to have made a century of appearances for her country. The others were Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Peter Shilton and Billy Wright. “It was a good quiz question,” she said.Doncaster, of course, was proud of the Belles: A small, tight-knit town on the edge of the South Yorkshire coalfield, it is not a place that attracts much national attention, or frequently enjoys much sporting success. The Belles changed that. “We won so much,” Coultard said. “The cup finals were on television. We felt like we represented Doncaster, and South Yorkshire. We kept the town at the pinnacle.”Edmunds remembers the club being asked to send representatives to have “afternoon tea with the Queen and Prince Philip” when they visited Doncaster. The players were guests of honor at the town’s Mansion House, the ornate Georgian home of the local authorities, on several occasions.“We never had any sexist stuff,” she said. “South Yorkshire people aren’t like that. It’s the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do. They get behind you. There was a real pride at what we achieved.”There was broader, cultural recognition, too. The writer Pete Davies spent a year with the team in the early 1990s; his subsequent book, “I Lost My Heart to the Belles,” coupled with the club’s success, made the name famous. The playwright Kay Mellor used the book as source material for “Playing the Field,” a BBC drama that ran for five seasons in the 1990s.To many, at a time when women’s soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention, the Belles were the sport’s most prominent face. “They were the epitome of women’s football,” said Mike Blackham. Like most of the people who go to watch the Belles now, Blackham and his wife, Jane, have a personal connection to the club: A friend plays for the first team.That is testament to how the club’s horizons have retracted in recent years. As the fortunes of women’s soccer have risen, those of the Belles have ebbed. “The women’s game has changed,” Edmunds said. “It is more financially driven. We have been left behind a little bit.”In 2013, when the Football Association, the sport’s governing body in Britain, expanded the Women’s Super League to two divisions, Doncaster Belles were demoted to the second tier and Manchester City’s women’s team — far younger but, crucially, aligned with a Premier League behemoth — were promoted in their stead. Vic Akers, then the manager of Arsenal Ladies, described the decision as “morally scandalous.”Doncaster was promoted back to the top flight in 2015, but lasted only a season before being relegated again. It won the second division last year, its first trophy since 1994, but did not take up its place in the top tier: The F.A. had changed the licensing criteria, and the Belles — lacking a headline sponsor and a major men’s team to bankroll the club — could not meet the new requirements. “Financially, we could not do it,” Edmunds said.All but two members of the championship-winning side departed, many for Manchester United’s new women’s team. Neil Redfearn, the manager, left for Liverpool. The Belles decided against using the Keepmoat Stadium, the neat, modern venue that is home to Doncaster Rovers, the men’s team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance, and set up instead in Rossington, where the two stands are little more than a few steps covered by a roof. Smaller surroundings, Edmunds said, would not be as “daunting” for the young players that now comprised the team.In Doncaster, the Belles’ fame endures, and so does the affection and esteem in which they are held. Edmunds, for example, is well-known enough in the town that, a few years ago, when she was awarded an honor in London for her contribution to sport, the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade: It referred to her by only her first name.Blackham, who coaches a local junior team, finds that while young boys dream of Premier League stardom, the girls tend to have a different ambition. “They don’t talk about playing for Manchester City or Chelsea or Arsenal,” he said. “They want to play for the Belles.”There is some regret at the club’s diminished status — “the demise of it is very sad, because it was so unique,” said Coultard — but there is no resentment of the game’s authorities, no lingering anger at the Football Association for failing to curate the most famous women’s team of all. “That era has gone,” Edmunds said. “We do not want people to forget that history, because so many people put so much into it, but we do not dwell on it.”Instead, she said, she takes satisfaction in seeing all of the players who came through the club’s ranks who have gone on to play professionally, to play in Europe, to play for their country.The golden age of the Belles may have come and gone, Edmunds said, but the club still has a role to play. “You look at those players and think we must be doing something right,” she said. “We still contribute. There is real pride in that.”Those Belles may be wearing different jerseys now, playing for different clubs, but they still bear the stamp of the club she helped to create. They all add a little more sheen to the legacy. In Edmunds’s eyes, they are still Belles. “That’s what we have always said,” she said, turning back to the day’s takings. “Once a Belle, always a Belle.”"
"Video Shows Undersea Wreck of Plane that Carried Soccer Star Emiliano Sala - The New York Times
LONDON — The wreckage of the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer striker Emiliano Sala and his pilot, David Ibbotson, has been found on the seabed in the English Channel, a shipwreck hunter said on Sunday, days after parts of the aircraft’s seat cushions were discovered on a French beach.The plane was found using an underwater drone that recorded video of the wreckage, including the body of one of the victims, the British government said on Monday. The video showed the aircraft registration number on the fuselage, confirming that it was the missing plane.“The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by police,” David Mearns, the shipwreck hunter whose team had been searching for the Piper Malibu plane, said on Twitter.The single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft  disappeared over the English Channel after departing Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Jan. 21, headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales.Mr. Mearns, a maritime scientist, told the British broadcaster Sky News on Sunday evening that the vessel “was located earlier this morning by my crew onboard the Morven,” referring to the search ship FPV Morven. Mr. Mearns’s company, Blue Water Recoveries, had been collaborating with the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or A.A.I.B., scanning the sea floor using sonar.A ship commissioned by the air accidents agency, the Geo Ocean III, launched a remotely operated vehicle, or R.O.V., to view the discovery at close range, the agency said in a statement on Monday.“Based on analysis of R.O.V. video footage, the A.A.I.B. investigators on board the vessel concluded that the object is wreckage from the missing Piper Malibu aircraft, registration N264DB,” it said. The underwater drone “carried out a further search of the area overnight, but did not identify any additional pieces of wreckage.”“Tragically, in video footage from the R.O.V., one occupant is visible amidst the wreckage,” the agency added, but it did not specify whether the body was Mr. Sala’s or Mr. Ibbotson’s. “The A.A.I.B. is now considering the next steps, in consultation with the families of the pilot and passenger, and the police.”Mr. Sala’s family had commissioned a private search after the authorities ended their search of the Channel’s surface and small islands on Jan. 24. David Barker, the harbormaster of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement at the time, “The chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote.”Mr. Sala, 28, a prolific goal scorer for Nantes in the French league, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City and was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day.The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart.After the authorities ended their search, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala’s sister, pleaded with the authorities not to call it off.“Please, please, please don’t stop the search,” Ms. Sala said at a news conference in Cardiff, fighting back tears.She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.A Facebook message to Mr. Sala’s sister seeking comment was not immediately answered on Sunday night.People from all over the world — including soccer stars like Kylian Mbappé, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year — chipped in to help the family’s search.Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Jan. 25 that by Sunday evening had raised more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000.Geo Ocean III departed Ostend, a coastal city in Belgium, on Sunday morning to begin a three-day underwater search, the A.A.I.B. tweeted. The search area was to cover about four square miles, according to the BBC.On Sunday evening, after the wreckage was discovered in the English Channel, Mr. Mearns told Sky News: “This is about the best result we could’ve hoped for the families, but tonight they’ve heard devastating news.”"
"Soccer: Equal Pay Still a Stretch for French Women - The New York Times
CLAIREFONTAINE, France — Women's soccer has been developing rapidly in France but Frenchwomen do not believe they are in a position to ask for the same financial treatment as the men even though their American counterparts have filed an equal pay lawsuit.France, fourth in the FIFA women's world rankings, are among the favorites for this year's World Cup on home soil, but they are still trailing the U.S., the three-times world champions.""The guys have a huge exposure, they have results and a lot of people following them,"" 21-year-old midfielder Grace Geyoro told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of a friendly game against Japan.While the U.S. men's team failed to qualify for last year's World Cup, Didier Deschamps's French side emerged triumphant in Russia.""The bonuses will depend on our performances, on how things are going to pan out, on what kind of exposure we will get,"" added Geyoro.""We would like to get a little bit more. Maybe not as much as the men but a bit more would be great,"" striker Valerie Gauvin, who plays at Montpellier, told Reuters.The 22-year-old is hoping that the World Cup will boost the sport's visibility and consequently, its financial attractiveness.""I hope it won't take too long even if it has been going in the right direction and maybe after this summer things will evolve faster and the World Cup will draw more media and more sponsors.""Deschamps's men earned 300,000 euros ($336,000) each after beating Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final and French media reported that the women will receive a 15,000-euro bonus each if they lift the trophy in Lyon on July 7.Paris St Germain player Geyoro explained that women's soccer has a higher profile in the U.S. due to the team's success at multiple World Cups.""In the U.S., women's soccer is growing faster,"" she said. ""Now it is up to us to increase our exposure."" One of the ways to increase exposure to the media and the fans would be for women to play in the same stadiums as the men.Last week, 39,000 supporters turned up for a women's game between Juventus and Fiorentina at Turin's Allianz Stadium.""We have played some games at the Parc des Princes for big events and obviously playing in bigger stadiums would attract more people,"" said Geyoro.Women playing in one of France's top clubs (Lyon, PSG, Marseille, Montpellier) earn an average 4,000 euros a month, according to French federation figures - a far cry from the reported 3 million euros a month earned by PSG's Neymar.However, it is not all doom and gloom for the women. ""There are less barriers with the fans, a lot of people can come and see us. There are more and more young girls coming to the stadium to see the training sessions for the games,"" said Gauvin, who managed to complete a marketing and communications course while playing football.($1 = 0.8925 euros) (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"Women's Soccer Gets Another Boost With Huge Crowd in Italy - The New York Times
MILAN — The setting was a major European soccer stadium, the actors on the grassy stage were playing themselves, and the scene was an Italian league women's match — one like never before.More than 39,000 people packed into the Allianz Stadium to watch Juventus Women beat Fiorentina Women 1-0 on a sunny Sunday afternoon, a record attendance in Italy that far eclipsed the old mark of 14,000.This was no Hollywood movie, though, this was another shining example of the exceptional growth of women's soccer.""You come out in those three seconds, you look around and you say to yourself, 'What is this, a cartoon?' But no, it's reality. And that's the beauty,"" Juventus coach Rita Guarino said. ""We need experience, we need to make it become the norm.""It was the first time the Juventus Women played at the same stadium that the men's team calls home, and tickets were free. But besides the huge crowd, one of the biggest ever for a European club match, it also drew more than 1 million unique viewers on television — nearly double the previous record for a women's soccer game on Sky in Italy.On March 17, there were 60,739 people at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium to watch Barcelona beat host Atletico Madrid 2-0 in a women's game. That followed a match in January which Athletic Bilbao said at the time was a European club record when 48,121 attended a Spanish Cup match against Atletico at San Mames Stadium.The match in Turin was another leap forward in the quest for wider acceptance.""When these numbers become ordinary, then it will be extraordinary,"" Fiorentina coach Antonio Cincotta said. ""This has to be a starting point, not a point of arrival.""The record attendance for any women's match was set at the 1999 World Cup when 90,185 people watched the United States beat China in the final at the Rose Bowl. But interest in women's soccer has seen its share of highs and lows.The Juventus players will surely notice a drop in adrenaline when they play their next home match against Tavagnacco on April 13. That game will be played club's training center in Vinovo, which has a capacity of only 500.That is among the lowest in the league, but no women's Serie A team plays in a stadium with a capacity of more than 4,000.""I don't think it's necessary to play in the same stadiums as the men play,"" AC Milan midfielder Lisa Alborghetti told The Associated Press. ""It's necessary that there are facilities able to hold a big number of fans and that can give the women what they need, simply that.""Besides several recent instances of big attendance numbers, women's soccer has been making gains in other areas as well.In the United States, the women's national team filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation over equal treatment and pay. The players said they were subjected to ""institutionalized gender discrimination"" that includes unequal pay with their counterparts on the men's national team.And in Denmark two years ago, the women's national team signed a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the federation to end a dispute that saw the cancellation of a World Cup qualifier.Video review is also expected to be used at this year's Women's World Cup in France, like it was at the men's tournament last year in Russia, while artificial surfaces for the competition have been ruled out.At the club level, the Women's Super League in England will receive record levels of investment after securing a sponsorship deal reportedly worth more than 10 million pounds ($13.2 million) over the next three seasons.Italy is a different story altogether, however, because women's teams are classified as amateur. But the growth still has been impressive to many.""When we played, if there were 100 fans that was a lot,"" said Barbara Garbagnati, a former player who attended the match in Turin because she is friends with Juventus goalkeeper Laura Giuliani.The fans inside the stadium made a day of it, too, cheering and chanting throughout the match while creating a relaxed atmosphere that made it a perfect opportunity for a family outing.Sofie Pedersen, who scored the lone goal against Fiorentina, was already impressed with the positive attitude in Italy even before the match started.""I think there is a lot of attention around women's football, more than I've (experienced) in other countries,"" said Pedersen, who has previously played for clubs in her home country of Denmark as well as in Sweden and Spain. ""I really feel that people have respect. They respect us and that's really amazing to feel that.""Alborghetti, now 25 years old and a member of Italy's World Cup-bound national team, has seen the ""incredible growth"" of women's soccer in Italy firsthand, starting from the days when she was the only girl on her local team.""Sometimes it was difficult, but above all because of the judgments, the people who would say, 'Oh, that team has a girl.' But then at the end of the match they would say, 'Well done, you have a girl.'""It happened almost all the time, all the matches,"" she said. ""The opposing teams would come on the field and be like, 'You have a girl,' and laugh. But at the end of the match they weren't laughing anymore.""___"
"German Soccer President Grindel Steps Down After Criticism - The New York Times
BERLIN — German soccer federation president Reinhard Grindel resigned Tuesday, bowing to increasing pressure following allegations of undeclared earnings, the receipt of a luxury watch and general discontent with his leadership.Grindel, who promised greater transparency after taking over in April 2016, apologized for accepting a watch worth about 6,000 euros ($6,700) from Ukrainian oligarch Grigoriy Surkis - a UEFA vice president and executive committee member at the time.""Everyone who knows me knows that I am not greedy and have been dealing with compliance issues for years,"" Grindel said in a statement issued by the federation. ""Mr. Surkis had no financial interest in the DFB (German federation). He never asked me for any support, then or after. It was clear at the time that he would not run again for UEFA's ExCo, to which he no longer belongs. There was and is no conflict of interest for me.""The federation said vice presidents Rainer Koch and Reinhard Rauball would take over on an interim basis until September. Koch and Rauball also took over after Grindel's predecessor, Wolfgang Niersbach, stepped down in November 2015 amid the fall out from allegations that Germany's bid to host the World Cup in 2006 was helped by bribery. Niersbach's predecessor, Theo Zwanziger, stepped down in 2012.Grindel's tenure as president was the shortest in the 114 years of the federation.On Monday, the 47-year-old Grindel avoided the red carpet at the opening of the German soccer museum in Dortmund.Grindel was accused by German weekly magazine Der Spiegel last week of failing to declare additional income of 78,000 euros ($87,000) for being chairman of the federation's subsidiary media management company in 2016 and 2017 - on top of his regular salary as president.The federation issued a statement to reject the accusations, saying Grindel took on the position with its subsidiary company only after he became president, and so was not obliged to declare the earnings at the time.But criticism of Grindel was growing louder.""When you're in such a position and such things come to light, you should at last have arguments to put them aside as soon as possible,"" former West Germany midfielder Lothar Matthaeus said. ""The DFB has been on shaky ground before.""Grindel was already under fire for his clumsy attempts to engage with fans while increasing the commercial appeal of German soccer. Monday night games, late kickoff times, and a ban on pyrotechnics have all proved unpopular with fans, who frequently display banners at games criticizing the federation.The former federation treasurer also emerged badly from his ham-fisted attempts to handle the controversy of national team players Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan posing for photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before the 2018 World Cup.Ozil quit after the tournament, saying he was being made a scapegoat for the team's poor performance and a target for racist abuse - and he was particularly scathing of Grindel, who subsequently expressed his regret over his handling of the matter.Grindel was criticized for agreeing to a hasty contract extension with Germany coach Joachim Loew after the tournament, while he recently complained about Loew's decision to drop Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller from the team - before doubling back.Grindel was also embarrassed in 2017 when a scheme to allow China's under-20 team to play against fourth-division clubs was abandoned because of protests from supporters displaying Tibetan flags.Andreas Rettig, managing director of second-division club St. Pauli, said at the opening of the new soccer museum that Grindel would not get a place in its hall of fame.""The DFB's appearance,"" Rettig said, ""has long been in need of improvement.""___"
"Swedish Female Soccer Players Call for Unity to Tackle Inequality - The New York Times
STOCKHOLM — With 30,000 tickets sold for their friendly against Germany in Stockholm on Saturday, Sweden's female players have called for unity to tackle inequalities between men and women in soccer, especially when it comes to money.Huge crowds have attended women's games in England, Italy and Spain recently and defender Nilla Fischer told Reuters that fans, players, sponsors and governing bodies would all have to work together to ensure better pay for female players.""I know that if I'd played in the (German men's) Bundesliga for six years, I wouldn't have any financial worries,"" Fischer said at the team hotel in Stockholm. ""In terms of percentages, you can't really compare. What they maybe make in an hour, I make in a year,"" the 34-year-old VfL Wolfsburg player added.The comments come after the U.S. women's team, the world champions, launched a lawsuit against their own federation last month alleging gender discrimination, which includes complaints about wages.Goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who plays for English club Chelsea, said players campaigning for equality in the women's game would continue to do so once they've hung up their boots. ""When we one day quit, we will fill places in these (soccer) organizations and keep the fight going forward. I do think it needs to be a kind of a public pressure, that we don't accept the way it is now,"" Lindahl told Reuters after a training session at the Friends Arena. ""I do however see the difficulties with these big organizations, FIFA especially, because it's their members that vote. I think we have to tackle big issues on the world stage in order for it to really change,"" she added.Fischer, who gave a fiery speech on the issue when receiving the Diamond Ball as Sweden's best female player in 2018, added that everyone in the game has a role to play. ""I think it's about the whole - I don't think it's about one organization or one clique or one part that is responsible,"" she said.Sweden are one of the 24 teams set to compete at the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7.

"No Verdict on Commander in 1989 Hillsborough Soccer Tragedy - The New York Times
PRESTON, England — A British jury failed to reach a decision Wednesday on whether the man in control of police operations at the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium tragedy that left 96 people dead is guilty of gross negligence manslaughter.Jurors at Preston Crown Court in northern England deliberated for eight days in the case of David Duckenfield, 74, who has denied 95 counts. The victims, all Liverpool fans, died in a crush in the stadium during a soccer match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.There can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries.A former official of Sheffield Wednesday soccer club, Graham Mackrell, 69, was found guilty of failing to discharge his duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The club's home ground was Hillsborough.Mackrell is to be sentenced on May 13. He faces a maximum sentence of an unlimited fine.Prosecutors said they will seek a retrial for Duckenfield.""I recognize that these developments will be difficult for the families affected by the Hillsborough disaster,"" said Sue Hemming, director of legal services for the Crown Prosecution Service.The original verdicts of accidental death for the victims were overturned in 2012 after documents uncovered mistakes by authorities and a cover-up by police, following a long campaign by families of the victims of Britain's worst sports disaster.Liverpool reacted to the decision reached by the jurors by saying the soccer club ""can empathize with the frustration shared by everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy that the outcome was not definitive.""___"
"A 20-0 Soccer Game in Italy Was Men Against Boys - The New York Times
For the most part, Sunday’s results from Serie C, the third level of Italian soccer, look like those of any other league around the world: Albissola 1, Arezzo 2. Alessandria 0, Arzachena 1. Cuneo 20, Pro Piacenza 0.Wait, what?That eye-popping score, and it’s not a typo, is part of a larger tale. Pro Piacenza 1919 is a venerable team from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. But the team has run into financial troubles, and most of its players and staff members, sick of not getting paid, walked out weeks ago.The team was penalized 8 points by the federation, dropping it to the rock bottom of the standings, and forfeited three straight matches.One more forfeit and the team could be disqualified from the league.So for Sunday’s visit to Cuneo, it was imperative that some kind of team be produced. Pro Piacenza, known as the Rossoneri, or Redblacks, scrambled. It mustered up some teenagers from the youth team, and a team masseur, for a total of eight players. The masseur’s number was hastily added to his uniform with tape. One of the youngsters, Nicola Cirigliano, was appointed the player-manager.Unfortunately one of the players, identified by the Italian press as Isufi, had forgotten his ID card and could not suit up, leaving the team with just seven players, the minimum allowed before an automatic forfeit.The game progressed as you would expect with seven inexperienced players going against 11. Cuneo passed at will, dribbled at will, and more or less scored at will. A highlight video is great viewing if you enjoy discouraged players trudging back to the center circle after yet another goal. Cuneo went into the break up by 16-0.Good news for Pro Piacenza: Isufi’s father retrieved his identifying documents, allowing him to join the game. Bad news for Pro Piacenza: the masseur had to leave the game with a cramp.In the end, Cuneo let up a bit, leading to the 20-0 final score.Hicham Kanis wound up with six goals, Edoardo Defendi had five, and hat tricks by Francesco De Stefano and Michele Emmausso were almost unnoticed.To be clear, although Serie C is a far cry from Juventus, the Milan giants and the high-quality play of Serie A, it is still a fully organized soccer league.Pisa, in the same division as Pro Piacenza, draws an average of 5,000 fans a game. The winner of the division will head up to Serie B, only a level below the likes of Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Ciro Immobile.But several teams at this level have struggled financially, among them Cuneo, the winning team Sunday. Matera has missed four matches and been disqualified.The Italian press did not like what it saw.La Gazzetta dello Sport called the match grotesque, “one of the saddest and surreal pages of Italian professional football.”Even a player on the winning side was embarrassed. “I feel only shame for those who made all this possible,” Fabiano Santacroce said.Francesco Ghirelli, the Serie C president, told Radio Rai that a game like that “must never happen again.”And on Monday he made sure it wouldn’t: Lega Pro, the governing body for Serie C, announced on Monday that Pro Piacenza had been kicked out of the league."
"Film in His Blood, a Soccer Revolution in His Plans - The New York Times
The trick, with Aurelio De Laurentiis, is to sit and to wait. He tends to take the scenic route through a conversation; his answers come wrapped in anecdotes and parables, laced with riddles and rhetorical questions.There are times when you wonder if he has taken one detour too many, become so distracted by his own tangents that he has lost his thread. Listening back, it is hard to pinpoint how, exactly, a question about the Champions League’s revenue distribution leads to a brief but powerful homily about the dangers of the ‘Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, but it does.It is, though, no great ordeal. De Laurentiis might be most famous now as owner of S.S.C. Napoli, the Italian soccer team he rescued from oblivion and painstakingly restored to Europe’s head table, but he is still, at heart, a film producer, a showman. He knows how to weave together a story, how to craft a compelling pitch. And when he gets to his destination, as he always does, it is invariably worth it.De Laurentiis is, after all, never knowingly short of ideas on how to revolutionize soccer, never without a sacred cow to slaughter, never without a tradition to overhaul. He has, at various times in the recent past, suggested cutting games from 90 minutes to 60 and advocated the effective abolition of UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, instead handing power directly to Europe’s biggest clubs.He is also never lacking an adversary, some villain standing in the way of progress, holding the game back through lack of imagination. His list has previously included not only UEFA but FIFA, Adidas, Nike, collective television deals and the Italian political establishment, among others. Many others.He does all this with a relish and a frequency befitting the scion of one of Italy’s great cinematic dynasties. In his eyes, soccer (and life, most likely) is entertainment. Creating a stir comes naturally. It is all part of the show.Sitting in a hotel in Liverpool, England, in December, on the eve of what would turn out to be Napoli’s final Champions League game this season, he did not require a vast amount of assistance, then, to land upon his current bête noire.He would like, he said, to change the way prize money is handed out by the major leagues. He thinks underperformance should not be rewarded. Rather, he thinks it should be punished. “You finish first, you get €100 million, for example,” he says. “You finish second, you earn €50 million, and so on. But if you finish last, you pay a fine.”This has been a recurrent theme for De Laurentiis this season. He has singled out Frosinone — a minor team from a town between Rome and Naples, promoted to Italy’s top league, Serie A, for only the second time in its history last year — as an example of a club that arrives in the top flight “already relegated.”Clubs like Frosinone do not draw fans, or interest, or broadcasters to the league, De Laurentiis says. They come up, they do not try to compete, and they go back down, except with their coffers stuffed by what he sees as an unwarranted share of the division’s television revenue.“The problem is the small teams have the same rights as the big ones,” he said, adding, with a reference to a type of bread: “Why should Frosinone have a season in Serie A, be given a slice of the pagnotta and then be relegated back to the third division? If they cannot compete, if they finish last, they should have to pay a fine. They shouldn’t be given money for failing.”After yet another tangent in which he dismisses an overmatched club in a major league as a mere “sparring partner,” he quickly builds up a head of steam. “Promotion and relegation is the biggest idiocy in soccer,” De Laurentiis says. “Especially when you also have UEFA trying to force clubs to comply with financial fair play rules. Clubs should be structured geographically, so they can all be self-sufficient. If they cannot survive financially, if they cannot be self-sufficient, they should be booted out.”It would be easy to listen to De Laurentiis’s words, to hear the many and varied ways in which he feels soccer has gotten things wrong, and to assume that he holds it in contempt, that he has wearied of the sport in the 15 years or so since he bought up what remained of Napoli — “just the name,” he has said previously — and set about reinvigorating it.His actions, though, are rather different. De Laurentiis is not distancing himself from soccer; rather, he is embedding himself more deeply in it. He has, for several years, been seeking to add another club to his portfolio; ideally, he would have liked one in London. “We never found the occasion,” he said.He switched his attentions to the United States, investigating an offer to buy an expansion franchise in Major League Soccer. He spent months examining proposals in Baltimore, Detroit and Las Vegas, he said, but was put off by the cost of a team — more than $150 million, plus the cost of a new stadium, in the last expansion round.Then, in August, De Laurentiis received a phone call from the mayor of Bari, a port city in Apulia, down near Italy’s boot heel. The local club, which played in Serie A as recently as 2011, had been declared bankrupt and had been relegated to the fourth tier of Italian soccer. The mayor offered De Laurentiis the chance to buy it.“I was surprised,” he said. “I don’t know anyone in Bari. I have barely ever been there.”More surprising still, however, is that De Laurentiis eventually said yes. Napoli and Bari are, strictly speaking, rivals, but suddenly the same family owned them: the older De Laurentiis in charge of the former, and his son, Luigi, given control of the latter.It was not, needless to say, a universally popular move. Though Bari’s fans were broadly welcoming — “They saw we were serious people,” Aurelio De Laurentiis said — there was dissent in Naples. “Get out of our city,” read one banner, slung from railings in the city the night the Bari purchase was announced.De Laurentiis insists that owning another team will not draw his focus from his first love. “Napoli is Napoli, Bari is Bari,” he said. His son, meanwhile, is adamant that the expertise he and his father have gleaned on the Tyrrhenian coast now can be applied on the Adriatic.“We started from zero,” Luigi said of Bari. “We had to create the brand, starting with a new crest, and then do all of the things necessary for a team: a season-ticket campaign, a website, the marketing, the social media, the jerseys, finding sponsors.”The rationale, the younger De Laurentiis said, is obvious. “Bari has a national appeal; we are the only team in our division being broadcast nationally,” he said, the result of a partnership with the streaming service DAZN. Apulia itself has seen a boom in tourism in recent years; the opportunity, the younger De Laurentiis said, was too good to ignore.The plan, needless to say, is to restore Bari to the top flight, even if that would create a battle with the game’s authorities over whether two teams in the same competition can have the same ownership.“Bari is a recognizable brand,” Luigi said. “It is not Frosinone. It has played in Serie A. It has a long list of famous former players.”It is not the sort of team, in other words, that Aurelio De Laurentiis would denounce as a sparring partner, a club whose only purpose is to pad out the standings and to pick up a paycheck. De Laurentiis might compulsively court controversy. He might prod and poke and provoke his rivals, and soccer’s authorities. He might do it all in the name of entertainment. He is, though, as good as his word. Bari is putting his money where his mouth is. He thinks soccer needs to change. So he is trying to change it."
"Morrison Looks to Revive Soccer Career at Quirky Ostersund - The New York Times
OSTERSUND, Sweden — From the Italian capital to western Mexico to a club located 200 miles from the Arctic Circle, a player who Alex Ferguson said ""possessed as much natural talent as any youngster"" at Manchester United is going to great lengths to revive his career.And be sure, Ravel Morrison really will be out of his comfort zone at Swedish team Ostersund.Forget the climate, which sees temperatures typically dip below minus-20 degrees C (minus-4 degrees F) in winter. Forget the sleepy nature of this small city in the middle of Sweden, which is known more for its winter sports than its soccer.Morrison, once regarded as the top English soccer talent of his generation, has taken on perhaps his biggest challenge yet because Ostersund might just be the most quirky and unconventional team around.The club prides itself on developing its players as people before sportsmen. Through what it calls its ""Culture Academy,"" players are faced with challenges to their mental process, their decision-making under pressure.""We have to do a stand-up comedy show at the end of this season,"" Ostersund coach Ian Burchnall said. ""We'll have to do comedy sketches and stuff. Every player and member of staff. It will be like a two-hour performance (in the city theater).""One year, they performed Swan Lake in front of the city's inhabitants. Last year, Burchnall was dressed up as one of the Sex Pistols, singing songs as part of an end-of-season musical production.""It's in all of our contracts, we are all in on it,"" Burchnall said. ""Ravel will do it, everyone will.""Quite simply, Ostersund has to do things differently, and that encompasses its transfer policy, too. To keep pace with the richer clubs from southern Sweden, Ostersund — which was in the country's fourth division as recently as 2011 — has become renowned for targeting players who have been rejected, made mistakes in their younger years, and who have failed to reach their potential for whatever reason.Morrison fits that bill.As a youngster a decade ago at United, Morrison was so good that Rio Ferdinand, a senior player at the time, described him as a ""superhero"" in a youth team that contained Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard. Ferdinand recalls him and Wayne Rooney being called over by Ferguson, who said of Morrison: ""This is the best kid you will ever see.""He only made three appearances — at the age of 17 — for United's senior team, however, as concerns grew about his attitude and the company he was keeping off the field.He ""kept getting into trouble,"" Ferguson wrote in his autobiography, and Morrison was sold to West Ham in 2012. There, and in later loan spells at Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff, he only showed flashes of his talent. In 2015, he moved to Italian club Lazio but was barely used, and he had a brief but enjoyable loan stint at Mexican side Atlas, in Guadalajara, in the 2017-18 season.Now, he is in Ostersund, the most northerly and remote team in Sweden's top division, and will make his league debut on Sunday against AIK on the first weekend of the season.""I've come here to rebuild myself,"" said the 26-year-old Morrison, who described himself as ""just a young, humble person from Manchester.""""I want to enjoy it and enjoy football again,"" he said.Martin Johansson, Ostersund's chief executive, said the club had no concerns about signing Morrison.""We've previously had players who have been convicted, had a history and been, you know, labeled as a trouble-maker in the media,"" Johansson said. ""I think the climate and the culture we have at the club probably appeals to him, in a sense where he can perhaps enjoy his football again.""In one of the team's last practice sessions before the AIK game, Morrison showed the touch and vision that got pundits and coaches so excited when he was young. Dropping deep, spraying the ball to either flank, flicking neat layoffs, Morrison was a cut above his teammates.""He had a great training session then, didn't he?"" said Burchnall, a twinkle in his eye.Burchnall knows all about Morrison from his time as a youth coach in northern England when his teams played against United.""He was a fantastic talent, and still is,"" Burchnall said. ""I think it's so easy for people to say he hasn't fulfilled his potential. But he is still young really, he still has years ahead of him.""Morrison signed a 4½-month contract with Ostersund, taking him to the Swedish summer and the midway point of the season. He will then have to decide whether he wants to extend his deal, or perhaps return fitter and fresher to England.Whatever happens, it will be an interesting ride.""It's a big move for him,"" Johansson said. ""As you know, it's a very cold place, it's a different climate to almost everywhere in Europe. We are just enjoying having him now. Let's see what the future holds.""______"
"At Yale, a Once Respected Soccer Coach Becomes an Enigma - The New York Times
As Rudy Meredith was inducted into the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame in January to honor his 24-year run as Yale women’s soccer coach, he sprinkled his hallmark humor and humility throughout his remarks.He recounted how his wife was on the opposite sideline for the University of Hartford when they met in the early 2000s. And he saluted several people in the audience while repeatedly expressing “thankfulness,” recalled Bill Duffy, a middle school principal and soccer lifer who served as master of ceremonies.There was nothing in Mr. Meredith’s words, Mr. Duffy said, “that would refer to anything that was going on.”Despite Mr. Meredith’s placid demeanor, people who knew him best had recently begun to detect changes in his behavior. He seemed to be more anxious. He appeared less enthusiastic about soccer, even before he resigned as Yale’s coach in November. He paid little attention to recruiting. He played poorly in pickleball, a paddle sport he usually excelled at.In hindsight, those hints of stress and fatigue coincided with revelations that Mr. Meredith, 51, had been the linchpin of a sprawling federal investigation into corrupt college admissions schemes that exploded into public view this week.At the heart of the scandal was a consultant, William Singer, who took $25 million to help fix exam scores or fraudulently misclassify prospective students as recruited athletes to boost their chances of being admitted to elite colleges. But the person who led federal authorities to Mr. Singer, according to court papers filed on Tuesday, was Mr. Meredith.In a Boston hotel on April 12, 2018, Mr. Meredith solicited a $450,000 bribe from the parent of a prospective college student in exchange for saving a Yale soccer recruitment spot for his daughter. Mr. Meredith took $2,000 from the parent, and directed the parent to wire future payments to a bank account in Connecticut. But the F.B.I. was secretly recording the conversation, the charging documents said. Then six days later, the parent, who was working with the authorities, wired $4,000 to Mr. Meredith from a bank account in Boston that the F.B.I. controlled, giving the government evidence of wire fraud.With the authorities on to Mr. Meredith, he told them about a deal he had struck in November 2017, when Mr. Singer had introduced him to a man who wanted his daughter to attend Yale. Mr. Singer helped doctor the application to make it seem as though she was the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California, even though she did not play at that level, according to the government documents. But Mr. Meredith told the admissions office he wanted to recruit her, and after she was admitted, Mr. Singer paid the coach $400,000.Late Friday, Yale released a statement in which it said one student involved in the scheme was admitted and is attending now, while the other was denied admission. In the statement, Peter Salovey, the university president, called the criminal actions “an affront to our community’s deeply held values of fairness, inclusion and honesty.” Mr. Salovey said the university was starting an internal investigation into its admissions process.Prosecutors said on Tuesday that Mr. Meredith had agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud, honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.Mr. Meredith did not respond to a request for comment. Paul Thomas, Mr. Meredith’s lawyer, who works at a New Haven firm founded by Felice Duffy, a former Yale soccer coach who later became a federal prosecutor and lawyer, declined to comment.It was a dramatic fall for a man considered to be a Yale institution. Mr. Meredith started as an assistant coach in 1992, rose to head coach in 1995 and led the team to its first unshared Ivy League title in 2005.The charges blindsided virtually everyone who knew Mr. Meredith, according to interviews with more than a dozen former players and others connected to Yale or soccer. Mr. Meredith was generous and well liked, and did not appear to have any health, financial or personal problems.“I’m both appalled and sympathetic — I would never have thought that he was capable of doing this,” said Sharon Eisen, a veterinarian who became friendly with the Merediths in recent years through pickleball, in which Mr. Meredith is a national-level player and coach. “On the one hand, I know them and like them personally. But on the other hand, I’ve lost all respect. So greedy. So immoral.”Mr. Meredith grew up modestly in the Rockville, Md., area, and was an all-state soccer player at Richard Montgomery High School. But he failed classes while at Montgomery College, and almost quit school. After undergoing tests at the urging of his coach and being found to have a learning disability, he turned his life around, and ultimately transferred to Southern Connecticut State. The university’s men’s soccer program was then a Division II powerhouse. Mr. Meredith played on the 1990 N.C.A.A. championship team, then embarked on a career coaching soccer and teaching physical education.Robert Kehoe, director of college programs for the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, said he first met Mr. Meredith in 1996 and worked closely with the Yale women’s team for the next several years as part of a development workshop he used to conduct.“He had a lot of credibility because he was a very good player in his own right,” Mr. Kehoe said.Mr. Meredith quickly fostered an energetic atmosphere. He required players to wear costumes for Halloween practice. He bought bagels and extra food on his own dime for long bus rides to away games, while good-naturedly enduring the film “Dirty Dancing” at his players’ behest.Yale enjoyed success in the mid-2000s, with the 2005 team reaching the third round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, knocking out third-seeded Duke in the process. Mr. Meredith coached several Ivy League players of the year and an all-American second-teamer who was profiled by ESPN. Meredith Speck, class of 2015, was the first Yale player in the National Women’s Soccer League, according to Yale's alumni magazine.“The thing I remember is how professionally he treated us,” said Theryn Gibbons, who was a member of Meredith’s first recruiting class in 1996 and now ranks third on Yale’s scoring list. “Refs were calling me Babe, and Rudy was never like that — we were athletes. He was very respectful, very sensitive.”If anything, Ms. Gibbons said, Mr. Meredith sometimes seemed intimidated by the aura of Yale, and tried hard to be liked.“He’s not sophisticated by any means, and I know he would defer to people who he thought were smarter,” said Ms. Gibbons, who later became a federal prosecutor. “He’s very trusting, and gullible for sure.”She added, “I’m not condoning what is alleged, but he’s family, and you stand by family.”Mr. Meredith’s wife, Eva Bergsten Meredith, was also a familiar presence at Yale soccer events. A former national team player for Sweden, she is the longtime women’s soccer coach at Wesleyan, and has also run, with her husband, Bulldog Cardinal soccer camp for many years.In 2013, in what former players said was an unusual move, the Yale women’s coaching position itself was endowed in Mr. Meredith’s name, thanks to an anonymous donation: For a time, Rudy Meredith was the Rudolph L. Meredith Head Coach of Women’s Soccer. Even after Mr. Meredith’s resignation in November, the name stuck: When Brendan Flaherty was hired as Mr. Meredith’s replacement the next month, it was as the Loring Family and Rudolph L. Meredith Head Coach of Women’s Soccer.Now, Mr. Flaherty is listed on Yale’s website as simply the Loring Family coach. It was not immediately clear when or why Yale made the change. A university spokesman said Mr. Meredith was not involved in funding and naming the position.In recent years, Yale’s teams did not perform as well as they had in the 2000s, and players and friends began to suspect that Mr. Meredith was no longer as gung-ho about soccer.Adele Jackson-Gibson, a Yale goalkeeper who graduated in 2013 and is now a freelance writer in Brooklyn, said she “could feel people become more defeated over time.” She added, “People seem tired and a little bit checked out.”Some players, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to be ensnared in the investigation, also began to notice a player or two, every couple of years, who did not belong on a Division I team, based on their skill level. Some of those players came from wealthy families, prompting speculation that their parents had donated money in exchange for coveted recruiting spots.In August 2017, the Merediths purchased a vacation home in Fernandina Beach, Fla., for $125,000, and took out a construction loan for $359,250, records show. The next month, Mr. Meredith was badly shaken, friends say, by the unexpected death of Fritz Rodriguez, a longtime assistant coach who had been Mr. Meredith’s roommate and teammate in college. So his resignation in November 2018 did not come as a complete surprise to some.What few knew, of course, was that he had been cooperating with federal authorities for roughly half a year.A Yale spokesman said the university learned about the scheme and the federal investigation only after the announcement that he was leaving.Mr. Duffy, the M.C. at the Hall of Fame ceremony, summed up the feelings of many people close to Mr. Meredith when he said that he was still processing the gravity of the scandal.“In the soccer community, we’re saddened by Rudy’s personal involvement, whatever that may be,” he said. “I think more people are angry that more deserving players were overlooked.”"
"Fiery Deaths of 10 Boys Exposes Brutality of Brazil’s Soccer Mills - The New York Times
RIO DE JANEIRO — Even in death the haggling went on.Christian Esmério was going to be the one — his family had been sure of it.He was 15 and towering, a soccer player with an easy smile that belied his prowess between the goal posts. Already there was talk of contracts, and of buying a home for his parents, who had poured all their savings into the dream that their son might be the next great Brazilian soccer export — the next Ronaldo, Ronaldinho or Neymar.Now, his father stood in a daze of grief outside a Rio office building, surrounded by lawyers. Just days earlier, Christian had burned to death in a fire at the youth academy of one of South America’s most famous soccer clubs, Flamengo. He was one of 10 players killed.The deaths lifted the veil over international soccer’s biggest production line, and raised sweeping questions about a brutal apparatus that chews up untold numbers of young Brazilian boys for every star it mints.But for the moment, as lawyers sparred over how much money families of the players killed in the blaze should get, there was just one simple question: What was Christian worth?“Dreams.”The word hung in the air as Rafael Stival let out a sigh.Mr. Stival’s for-profit talent scouting operation had posted a note on Facebook mourning three of its graduates who had died in the fire at Flamengo. Since then, the messages had been pouring in.They were not condolences. The Facebook post had inadvertently acted as an advertisement — a signal to ambitious parents that Mr. Stival’s organization could get their boys into not just any club, but the great Flamengo. They wanted Mr. Stival to give their boys a chance.The soccer world in Brazil is populated by a variety of actors, some drawn by glory, but almost all attracted by the chance of breaking out of poverty, maybe even striking it rich.There are the boys, of course, and their families. There are the investors and the middlemen like Mr. Stival, who trawl the continent-size country in search of prospects as young as 9. And there are the teams, many in a state of such financial disarray that only the sale of the latest star keeps them afloat.The profits from investing wisely, and early, in even a single player can run into the tens of millions of dollars.To many in the game, the industry has grown out of control. It has morphed from a system intended to develop promising players into an international market whose value is $7 billion a year, according to soccer’s global governing body, FIFA. In this speculative environment, talented young athletes — some of them children — are bought and sold like any other raw material. In Brazil, the best ones are even referred to that way: as “gems.”No one knows for sure how many boys are in Brazil’s youth soccer system.There are no official figures. Estimates range from 12,000 to 15,000, but that is hard to corroborate. The Brazilian soccer federation makes no effort to track players until they turn 16 and become professionals.But one thing is known: On the night of the Flamengo fire, Feb. 8, more than two dozen boys — most from poor families, and all hoping to achieve a dream — were asleep in a club dormitory.In a country obsessed with soccer, Flamengo prides itself on being the most popular team, with wealth that is the envy of rivals across South America. But that adoration and power, it appears, may have allowed Flamengo to escape for years any real censure for the treatment of boys in its care.In 2015, Rio state prosecutors sued Flamengo over the conditions at its training center. The prosecutors cited child-protection failures, declaring the conditions to be “even worse than those currently offered to juvenile delinquents.”City officials issued an order closing the facility in 2017, but never carried it out, limiting their sanctions to dozens of fines.In recent years, Flamengo spent millions to upgrade its youth academy. Last year, club officials boasted that the new facilities would be the best in Brazil.But the dormitory holding 26 sleeping boys on the night of the fire was a makeshift structure, consisting of six steel containers fused together. It had never been inspected, according to local authorities.Interviews with survivors of the fire and officials who investigated it suggest that a series of failures may have contributed to the boys’ deaths:— Federal regulations require at least one caretaker for every 10 boys, but there was no adult present at the time of the fire.— Survivors said the only exit from the dorm was at its far end. Some of the boys may have been in beds farther away from the exit than the 33-feet limit required by the regulations.— The rooms had sliding doors, another violation because they can jam.— And while each room had a window, the openings were covered with grates.One boy who was in Christian’s room told investigators their door had stuck when he tried to get out. The boy managed to slide through the window grates. But Christian, a strapping 6-foot-3 goalkeeper, could not. When rescuers got to him, his body was so badly charred he could be identified only through dental records.Flamengo officials did not respond to interview requests. But in February, its president, Rodolfo Landim, denied knowing about any irregularities when he spoke at a news conference after the fire.“Our goal is to solve this problem as quickly as possible,” he said.Soccer is hardly the only industry to attract Brazil’s desperate.Sergio Rangel, a journalist who has covered the sport for three decades, says the youth-training system reminds him of the giant gold mine in Serra Pelada. The horrific conditions there were immortalized by the photographer Sebastião Salgado in the 1980s.Desperately poor men from all over the country swarmed the mine’s open pit, turning over rocks in the hope of finding the nugget that would change their lives.Soccer has also been a fool’s gold of sorts for many families. Some of them move hundreds, even thousands of miles to enroll their sons in training programs that will sort, scrutinize and, more often than not, reject their child as worthless.“Pick one up, turn it over, and throw it away if it’s no good,” Mr. Rangel said.The young men are not just disposable. To those who run the industry, they are often indistinguishable.That much was clear at a memorial for the 10 players who died at Flamengo. Midway through the service, a team official rushed to cover a large montage of photos of the boys: someone had realized that a player who survived had been mistakenly included.The streets of Xerém, about 50 kilometers outside Rio, teem with boys of various ages in red, green and white jerseys — the colors of the Fluminense soccer club.Until the team built its training complex there, Xerém was little more than a swamp, locals say. But now, despite the humid heat that tops 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is home to players and families whose lives revolve around the club.Among them earlier this year was an 11-year-old nicknamed Maradoninha, for his resemblance to the former Argentine great Diego Maradona. Even in this hotly competitive town, Maradoninha was attracting attention.Two years ago, a talent scout from Fluminense saw the boy, whose real name is Leandro Gomes Feitosa, play in a local tournament and approached his family. The boy was only 9, and Brazilian law does not allow soccer clubs to house children under 14. But if the family could get to Rio, the scout said, Fluminense would train him. A group of local businessmen put up the money — for a cut of future proceeds — and the family moved more than 1,200 miles, from the town of Palmas to Xerém, to pursue the dream.Almost all the families living in their community of 26 rowhouses have a similar story, Maradoninha’s father, Evandro Feitosa, said.Maradoninha may not be old enough for high school, but he knows his family’s future is tied to his skills with a soccer ball. “God willing,” he said, “I’ll become a big player to help my family in Palmas, my family here and those in need.”The chances of making it are slim. Fewer than 5 percent of the soccer prospects in Brazil will ever make it as professionals, by most estimates. Fewer still will earn a decent wage in the game. A study published by the Brazilian soccer federation in 2016 found that 82 percent of soccer players in the country earned less than 1,000 reais ($265) each month.And for Maradoninha and his family, the odds recently got even slimmer: Fluminense released him.Whatever the odds, whatever the hardship, there are enough soccer success stories to feed the hopes of young boys and families who have little else to aspire to.There is Neymar, so successful he is more international brand than player. He is the product of a humble neighborhood on the outskirts of São Paulo. There are Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Romário, three former Brazilian World Cup winners, all awarded the title of best player in the world in their time by FIFA.And most recently, there is Vinicius Junior, a flashy forward who rose out of Flamengo’s youth ranks. He once trained on the same fields as the 10 boys killed in the fire, and then he began living the dream: in 2017, when he was 16, Spain’s Real Madrid agreed to pay 45 million euros (just over $50 million) for his rights after he played just 11 minutes in his debut game.All of those players, and hundreds more, have emerged from the Brazil’s soccer mill to ply their trade on the world’s biggest stages.In his early days in the sport, Christian’s parents used all they had — and borrowed from friends and neighbors — to finance his soccer dream.He seemed to be getting closer to his own version of the soccer success story. On March 5, the day he turned 16, he was expected to sign his first professional contract at Flamengo. His dream, years in the making, was in reach.He died four weeks before that birthday.Days after his death, his father, Cristiano Esmério, was standing outside an office tower in downtown Rio where public defenders were meeting with officials from Flamengo. He was with a group of lawyers. One turned to him.When it came to compensation, the lawyer said, it would be unfair if Christian's family was treated the same as the others. After all, he said, some of the dead boys had been recent arrivals to the club. But Christian was different: He had been called up to one of Brazil’s youth national teams. Clearly he was worth more than the rest.Esmério nodded silently. He and his son had discussed money, too.“Dad, let’s look for a house,” he recalls Christian saying when he got word that he was closing in on a professional contract. “My first paycheck, I want to pay for a house for my mom, so she doesn’t have to suffer because she doesn’t have water or electricity.”A week before he died, the boy posted a tribute to his family on Facebook. Above two pictures of father and son taken a decade apart, he made a promise:“All the sacrifice will be compensated, my old man.”"
"Women Finally Get Their Own World Cup Soccer Style - The New York Times
The United States women’s soccer team has been fighting for gender parity not just in the courts — suing the United States Soccer Federation last week for discrimination — but also in their uniforms, known as kits. And at least when it comes to the clothes and the Women’s World Cup, they have won.On Monday, at a global event in Paris, Nike revealed the new home and away uniforms for 14 out of 24 competing teams, and for the first time since the brand began working with the WWC tournament in 1995, each one of them was made specifically for the women’s teams, not as derivations or extensions of kits made for men. Three days before, to coincide with International Women’s Day, Adidas released its new designs for four WWC teams.In the larger picture of gender issues and sports, this may not seem like a big deal. But the clothes athletes wear speak loudly about identity and allegiance, and have the power to help instill confidence. Clothes are also the easiest way for fans to assert their own allegiance, aspiration and personal connection. They are, above all, symbols. And now they are finally symbols of parity.“We are shifting more resources to women,” said Amy Montagne, the vice president for global categories at Nike — and not just because this is the largest number of teams the company has worked with. (It outfitted 11 clubs for the 2015 Women’s World Cup.) But because, Mark Parker, the chief executive, said, “We believe this summer can be another turning point for the growth of women’s football.”Certainly, given Nike’s current emphasis on women’s sports — the Dream Crazier campaign, a series of new initiatives designed to support women’s coaching and engage more girls — as well as its own experience with Serena Williams and the current focus on female dress in the competitive arena, it would have been fairly hypocritical for the company to treat its women’s soccer kit as in any way secondary to men’s. (Especially given Nike’s own somewhat uncomfortable internal history with gender issues.)Yet it wasn’t until 2015 that Nike began making women’s soccer jerseys in men’s sizes so that more male fans could buy them. And it wasn’t until the players really spoke up that things began to change.“Three years ago they said, ‘We want our own thing,’” Cassie Looker, the senior apparel product manager for global football, said in a call from France. “Their own thing” refers to both fit and to the design of the uniforms, which Nike refers to as the “storytelling.”According to Ms. Looker, the fit took three years and multiple four-dimensional body mapping sessions of professional athletes to adjust. “They are shaped differently than the standard body type,” she said. “They generate most of their power from their lower body.”While male soccer players like a slimmer fit — “It makes them feel more powerful, like superheroes,” Ms. Looker said — women are more interested in comfort and “looking professional.” This meant a lot of focus on the length of the sleeve (the athletes did not want to expose too much of their upper arms) and the neckline, which ended up halfway between a V-neck and a crew neck, with enough give to be easily pulled over a ponytail. “They want zero distractions,” she said.Most of this may be lost on the armchair soccer fan, though the storytelling implicit in the design will not. (In any case, the kits are available in two fits: athlete and “stadium,” or looser, for the weekend fan.) Though the kits rely on the color palettes of national flags, the difference is often in the pixelated details. “Chile, France, U.S.A. — they are all red, white and blue,” Ms. Looker said, which can make them hard to distinguish. “We bring it up all the time internally.”What to expect? The United States jerseys have a throwback patriotism with (in the home kit) direct references to the jerseys worn by the 1999 team that transformed the profile of women’s soccer in America: white, with red and blue stripes on the sleeves. The names of the 50 states are printed in gray on the back, and three stars over the crest nod to the three championships the United States has won. The away kit has tonal abstractions of stars and stripes on red (though they read a little blotchy from afar).Also tonal are the roses and assorted other florals on the four burgundy-red quadrants of the England jerseys, which is why France’s hexagonal blue polka dots on white stand out, as does the Norwegian snowflake pattern that fades from red to blue, giving their home jersey an Empire-waist effect and uniting the shorts and top.By athlete request Chile, Nigeria, South Africa and Korea have the same pattern that the men’s teams wore in the 2018 World Cup, though the fit has been customized for the women. (At least in Nigeria’s case, the look was so successful that you can kind of understand why they didn’t want to mess with a good thing.)And then there’s Australia. Of all 14 Nike team looks, this will likely be the most controversial; a canvas of forest green, mustardy gold and white slashes and splotches that looks sort of like animal print meets modern art landscape painting. Together with the Sweden kit, by Adidas, which features the faces of female role models chosen by the players embedded in the numbers on the back of each jersey, it makes a statement that, on the pitch or the street, will be impossible to miss.

"U.S. Women's Soccer Team Says Lawsuit About More Than Money - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — Members of the United States women's soccer squad (USWNT) have told Reuters their lawsuit against the national federation alleging gender discrimination is not just about wages but also improving the sport for women participating in it at all levels. All 28 members of the squad were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court last month and says the women are not paid the same as their male counterparts.While the U.S. men's team have voiced their support, the U.S. Soccer Federation has said it was surprised by the lawsuit, with its president, Carlos Cordeiro, saying it strives for equal pay and has boosted its investment in female player development programs.Midfielder Megan Rapinoe told Reuters in an interview timed with Equal Pay Day on April 2 that they were also pushing for systematic change. ""For us it is really important to really look at the bigger picture of the compensation piece,"" she said. ""I don't think you can talk about compensation articulately or intelligently until you have a conversation about funding across the board,"" she said. ""So whether that is youth teams or staffing for each team or promotion and sponsorship, you know, advertising for both teams, I don't think that that is equal yet,"" she said. ""So yes we are fighting for equal compensation but we are also fighting for this larger picture of investment in both programs equally.""Since the lawsuit was filed, some companies have stepped in to help close the pay gap. Nutrition snack company Luna Bar on Tuesday announced that it would give each member of the squad competing at the Women's World Cup a one-time payment of $31,250 -- the difference in the bonus paid to the men's World Cup squad.Sportswear company Adidas has also said that if the USWNT win the Women's World Cup this year its sponsored players would receive the same performance bonus payments as their male counterparts.'FLAWED SYSTEM'The players said change was also needed outside the United States. ""We are hopeful that FIFA is doing things to put more women in executive positions and more women within FIFA in general,"" striker Alex Morgan told Reuters. ""We still feel like they are very behind on the trend and we are hopeful that what we are doing today and the continual fight that we have will help FIFA proactively change the inner workings of the system that is very flawed within them as well.""Morgan said the team hoped to improve the lives of the next generation of female athletes. ""I think we realize the opportunity we have and the resources we have are due to the generation before us and we hope to increase those opportunities and resources available for the generation after us,"" she said.""We might not see equal pay among athletes within our generation but the hope is that the future generations will.""The women said the lawsuit would not distract them from their efforts to win back-to-back World Cups, and a fourth title overall, when they compete in France in June.""Success for us is very simple and it is very clear from the first second that you get on the team, whether it is like a passing pattern or a small-sided game or a friendly or a World Cup final -- it's winning,"" Rapinoe said. ""It's competing to the best of your ability, it's trying to be the absolute best that you can so for us the expectation is always the same, success for us looks like winning,"" she said.

"Soccer: Australia Captain Kerr Shelves Friendships Before U.S. Warmup - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Australia captain Sam Kerr will line up against familiar faces when the 'Matildas' take on FIFA's top-ranked side the United States on Thursday but the prolific striker says all friendships will be put on hold for the World Cup warmup in Denver.The 25-year-old has starred in the National Women's Soccer League since its establishment in 2013, claiming a second 'Golden Boot' award as the top scorer in 2018 after netting 16 times in 19 matches for Chicago Red Stars.The U.S. squad features a number of her Chicago team mates, including midfielder Julie Ertz and defender Tierna Davidson, and other former colleagues at other clubs.""It's a different experience ... In the change-room at Chicago there was a bit of banter going,"" said Kerr after the Matildas' final training on Wednesday.""But there will be no friends tomorrow when we cross that line.""And I guess if there is, you go harder on your friends than anyone else.""Australia, quarter-finalists at the last World Cup in Canada, are keen to benchmark their progress against the defending champions in the friendly ahead of the global showpiece in France starting in June.The United States have a dominant winning record over the Australians but have been troubled by them in recent matches.They were upset 1-0 by the Matildas at the 2017 Tournament of Nations and were held 1-1 in the same tournament last year.Kerr said Australia had traditionally been guilty of worrying about the U.S. game more than their own, and that the team were more focused on developing for the World Cup rather than getting a result in Denver.""It is a good benchmark but at the end of the day this is preparation for the World Cup,"" she said.""We're going to be focusing on ourselves. We hope that we can win but the most important thing is continuing the journey to improve to get to the World Cup."" (Writing by Ian Ransom in Melbourne; Editing by Peter Rutherford)"
"Ex-Coach of Yale Women's Soccer Pleads Guilty in Admissions Scandal - The New York Times
BOSTON — The former head coach of women's soccer at Yale University admitted on Thursday that he accepted bribes to help parents get their children into the Ivy League school, becoming the third person to plead guilty in the U.S. college admissions scandal.Rudolph ""Rudy"" Meredith, whose decision to cooperate helped investigators discover the mastermind of the wide-ranging scheme, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to conspiracy and wire fraud charges.He is among 50 people, including the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, charged with participating in the scheme, headed by college admissions counseling service operator Rick Singer.Prosecutors said the consultant charged wealthy parents hefty sums and then used bribes and cheating to illegally secure admission for their children to universities including Yale, the University of Southern California and Georgetown University.Some $25 million in bribes were paid to coaches including Meredith who helped Singer's clients secure spots for their children as fake athletic prospects, prosecutors said.Singer also facilitated cheating on college entrance exams, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty on March 12 to charges including racketeering conspiracy and is cooperating with investigators.Prosecutors said Meredith agreed beginning in 2015 with Singer to accept bribes to designate applicants as recruits to the Yale women's soccer team regardless of their athletic abilities.In one instance, prosecutors alleged that Meredith in 2017 accepted a $400,000 payment to designate the daughter of a Los Angeles-based financial advisor as a soccer recruit even though she did not play competitive soccer.Singer sent Meredith a fabricated athletic ""profile"" for the student that claimed she was co-captain of a prominent California club soccer team, prosecutors said.In total, Meredith received more than $860,000 from Singer, prosecutors said.Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen said in court the scheme was uncovered during an investigation into an unrelated ""pump-and-dump"" stock market scheme involving a California man, who told prosecutors he was engaged in a bribery scheme with Meredith.The California man, father of a Yale applicant, was Morrie Tobin, who pleaded guilty on Feb. 27 to conspiracy and securities fraud charges, a person familiar with the matter said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, after receiving the tip, secretly recorded a meeting in which Meredith sought $450,000 in exchange for designating Tobin's daughter as a soccer recruit, according the person and court records.Rosen said investigators learned about Singer during that meeting. He said Meredith subsequently agreed to record phone calls with Singer, helping prosecutors build their case against him. (Reporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio)"
"It’s an Anti-Fascist Thing: How an Obscure German Soccer Team Gained a Brooklyn Cult - The New York Times
In a dive bar underneath the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, fans of an obscure soccer team gathered after an entire workday of information blackout. They spent their Tuesday avoiding calls from family members and social media in its entirety because they didn’t want to spoil the outcome of a match that technically ended long ago, halfway across the world in Germany.When their team scored what would be their only goal of the game, the supporters chanted raucously for “the boys in brown,” thrusting their pints in the air, none the wiser that it was, as it frequently has been, already a lost cause.“One of the biggest crimes you could commit with this group is to mention you know the outcome,” said Karl Paranya, who lives in the neighborhood and has been watching the matches since he first stumbled into East River Bar about seven years back. “It can be a bit awkward because our cries don’t do anything for a team that finished eight hours ago, but it feels the same for us.”The team they follow is F.C. St. Pauli, a tiny club whose games no cable soccer package broadcasts live; it would be like expecting to find an Orlando Solar Bears hockey game on ESPN.But what draws Mr. Paranya and the rest of the supporters here is the team’s unusual politics: F.C. St. Pauli is an avowed anti-fascist soccer team based in Hamburg that plays in Germany’s second division and hasn’t won the title in more than 40 years, though it runs a kindergarten inside the stadium, which displays signs proclaiming “no person is illegal.” The club has a worldwide, international fandom that defines itself in opposition to the racism and violence that characterizes European football hooliganism.The East River Pirates, as they’re known, are still only maybe one of 10 supporters’ groups in North America, and the only official one in the city. As such, East River Bar has become an unlikely spiritual home for German tourists, as well as a set of extremely devoted American fans who are far more interested in the team for their politics than whether or not they’re in possession of the ball at any given time.“It’s not like we’re that invested in the game play or the results,” said Shawn Roggenkamp, age 32, who helps coordinate the loose gathering of fans. “But it is a reason for us to get together every week and bring this group of people together who maybe wouldn’t have found each other any other way.”East River Bar, which began as paint factory and was also a biker hangout in a previous life, was purchased about 15 years ago by Marek Gregorski, a Polish expatriate. His intention was originally to serve food, though he said the money for that part of the business fell through. The cheap drinks, cavernous space, and location next to the Williamsburg Bridge soon attracted a specific clientele, which Mr. Gregorski happily catered to. “At some point we started to get some bike messengers, more and more of them, and we became a staple for hosting messengers and their parties,” Mr. Gregorski said. “They get off work, and this is their first stop to get a beer and relax a little bit.”The Pirates, who celebrated their 10th anniversary this past November, were initially regarded as oddballs at East River, which is decidedly not a sports bar, unless you count billiards or biking. Out front, there’s a sign featuring an enormous gear and a vending machine selling spare inner tubes. The backyard has communal grills for customer barbecues in warm weather. The inside is sparsely decorated, and being a classic dive, contains only a couple of tiny televisions that are always on but no one pays much attention to. A regular game day will bring a mix of bike punks, New York soccer heads, and Germans on a pilgrimage to watch St. Pauli on a giant projector screen instead.Ms. Roggenkamp, who works for the auction house Christie’s, was introduced to the cult of St. Pauli about five years ago when she was studying German through a private program. A classmate took her to watch a game at East River. Over the next year and a half, she slowly started to take on a leadership role in the supporters’ club. In keeping with the team’s philosophy, that typically involves passing a collection cup for charity during halftime. The ritual takes on an air of communion — a characterization that Ms. Roggenkamp agrees with.“I was having a conversation about it with one of my friends the other day,” she said. “And he was like, ‘You talk about this as if it’s your church group.’”Jah Jah Brown, half of the Brooklyn-based rap duo known as Ninjasonik, has been coming to watch games at East River Bar for the past six years because he’s enamored with the team’s politics. He said that German tourists regularly walk into the bar, which is typically full of bicycles, and have to ask, “Are we in the right spot?”In fact, the bar is a bridge between the two nations. Mr. Paranya remembered being with a Turkish friend years ago and lamenting that he didn’t have a geographical allegiance to a soccer team as an American. The friend immediately pegged him as a would-be St. Pauli fan, though the comment was initially forgotten. Years later, he and his wife popped into East River Bar for a beer, where a game happened to be screening. After about five minutes, he realized who was playing. “I remembered that I was supposed to like these guys,” Mr. Paranya said. “By the end of the game I was singing all the songs and had purchased a T-shirt.” A few years later, he took a trip to Germany, which he described as a pretense to visit St. Pauli’s stadium. He wore his supporters shirt and made about “20 new best friends,” some of which he now sees occasionally when they come to visit the United States and make their obligatory trip to Williamsburg.With about 10 minutes left in the game that Tuesday, the other team scored, though not many fans seemed to notice. When they sunk another goal and things seemed good and over, one of the Pirates’ organizers, Sören Thode, switched the broadcast to a YouTube video of the German entertainer Hans Albers’s ode about the Reeperbahn — the red-light district district of working-class Hamburg. People finished their beers and said their goodbyes until the next match on Monday afternoon, though they, of course, wouldn’t be watching until nightfall."
"Take Your Best Shot: Life Lessons With Soccer Star Alex Morgan - The New York Times
NEW YORK — Everyone has a dream of making it to the top, but what happens when you actually get there? Only a handful of people even know what that is like.One of them is Alex Morgan, the soccer phenom and forward for the U.S. women's national soccer team - ranked #1 on the planet, by the way - heading into the World Cup in France starting this June.For the latest in Reuters' ""Life Lessons"" series, the 29-year-old idol for young girls worldwide reminisces about how she dribbled her way to global stardom - and talks about what will come after the final whistle.Q: Did you have a backup career in mind, in case soccer didn't work out?A: I had a dream that I wrote down on a yellow sticky note when I was seven years old. It said, 'Dear mom, my dream is to be a professional soccer player. Love, Ali.' My mom kept that for years.At the time there wasn't even a professional league, and I had never even seen the women’s national team play. So I never even thought about a Plan B, even though I went on to study political economy in college.Q: When you did make it as a pro, how did you handle fame and wealth?A: For two years after I started on the national team, I couldn't receive any checks because I was playing for the NCAA. They have very strict rules about that. So my bank account in college was pretty grim, and my diet involved ramen noodles or finding the cheapest takeout.Since I was a student-athlete, they did let me eat at the university cafes, so I would usually be there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A lot of times I would be down to a few bucks, wondering how to get through the next couple of days before my food card was replenished.So when I did become a professional player and started getting paid, that was a nice change. Nowadays I manage to save around 70 percent of what I make.Q: What have you learned about managing money?A: As a professional athlete, your income isn’t steady. Sometimes you get big checks and then sometimes you don’t get much for a couple of months. Lump sums come in randomly, since a lot of what I make is through partnerships with sponsors. So it’s been a learning curve for me to navigate that.Q: You have started numerous side ventures, so what lessons about entrepreneurship can you share?A: For me, with my book series and the movie I did for Nickelodeon, I like to take chances when the pressure is on. When I control things as much as possible, that is when I want to bet big, because I have a good sense of what I am able to do. So how I act in the business world is quite similar to how I act on the soccer pitch. I am happy betting on myself, and I tend to achieve more when my back is against the wall.Q: Where do you spend your philanthropic time and money?A: The main focus is kids and animals. I do a lot of work with Boys & Girls Clubs, and I’m an ambassador for UNICEF. I also support the ASPCA, because I am passionate about giving animals a voice. I even adopted a vegan diet, because it didn’t feel fair to have a dog I adore, and yet eat meat all the time.Q: Have you envisioned what your retirement from soccer is going to look like?A: I would love to start a family, and live in southern California, maybe in San Diego. My husband (LA Galaxy midfielder Servando Carrasco) definitely wants to stay in the soccer world, and I am enjoying dipping my toes into new areas, like books and movies. It is an exciting time.Q: For that future family, what life lessons would you like to pass along?A: Something I would want for my kids is to be confident and dream big, regardless of what obstacles are in the way. That is what I did when I was seven, not even knowing that professional soccer was a possibility. I would love for that message to hit home with them. (Editing by Beth Pinsker and G Crosse)"
"Soccer: Australia to Receive World Cup Progress Report Against U.S. - The New York Times
(Reuters) - The Australian women's soccer team will get an early indication of their World Cup prospects when they face defending champions the United States in a friendly in Denver on Thursday.The Matildas, under new boss Ante Milicic, made short work of New Zealand, South Korea and Argentina to win the inaugural Cup of Nations on home soil last month but will be keen to see how they stack up against the top-ranked side in the world.""It’s a fairly daunting task to be involved in your first camp and be playing the number one ranked team in the world but we’re playing with a fabulous group of players,"" rookie defender Liz Ralston said.""There’s a really big emphasis on every drill, every session, making sure you make the most of it.""Ranked sixth in the world and boasting one of the world's top strikers in captain Sam Kerr, the Matildas have a much better chance of winning the World Cup than Australian men's team, who are ranked 42nd and were eliminated in the group phase at the global showpiece in Russia last year.The Matildas reached the quarter-finals at the 2015 tournament in Canada, their best result, and have only grown in confidence since.However, their preparations for the June 7-July 7 World Cup in France were thrown into chaos with the abrupt sacking of long-serving coach Alen Stajcic in January.Stajcic was dismissed for what the governing Football Federation Australia said was a ""poor culture"" around the team, rather than for failing to produce results.Milicic, appointed as a caretaker to steer the team through the World Cup, has proved a popular replacement and returned calm to a squad that was distracted by reports of dressing room disharmony.Milicic is keen to give fringe players a chance to shine at their camp in Colorado and has made five changes to his Cup of Nations squad, including the uncapped duo of UCLA goalkeeper Teagan Micah and Sydney FC defender Ralston. Experienced midfielder Katrina Gorry and Washington Spirit attacker Chloe Logarzo return after injuries, with 16-year-old striker Mary Fowler lured back after snubbing an international call-up by Stajcic last year.While more than half the squad play for U.S. teams, a large Australia-based contingent have had to get used to the freezing cold in Colorado quickly after traveling from balmy conditions back home.""(It's) something we're not used to, we’re not used to the chill and it’s a different climate and a different atmosphere here but it’s been nice,"" said Melbourne-based forward Emily Gielnik.Following the friendly against Jill Ellis-coached United States, Australia switch to warmer climes in Turkey for a pre-World Cup camp before heading to France where they meet Italy, Brazil and Jamaica in Group C.

"European Soccer Players Back Italian Following Racial Abuse - The New York Times
MILAN — A black player for Italy's most popular soccer club won support from other European players Wednesday, a day after he was subjected to a torrent of racist abuse from an opposing team's fans.Juventus forward Moise Kean scored his team's second goal against Cagliari late in the 2-0 victory Tuesday and stood in front of the home fans with his arms outstretched. That seemed to trigger a furious and openly racist outcry from the fans.One of his teammates, Leonardo Bonucci, added fuel to the fire by saying Kean was partly to blame for the angry response. That prompted players on other teams to rush to Kean's defense.Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling, who is black, ridiculed the remark: ""Leonardo Bonucci ... All you can do now is laugh."" He also posted a screenshot on Twitter.""I support every fight against racism, we're all equal,"" Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba wrote in an Instagram post of Kean celebrating his goal. The Frenchman, who used to play for Juventus, then added, in Italian: ""Good Italians wake up, you can't let a small group of racists talk for you.""Kean, a 19-year-old Italian whose parents are from Ivory Coast, was insulted by home fans during much of Tuesday's game in Cagliari. He received a yellow card for faking an injury in the first half.His goal and ensuing celebration seemed to push the home fans over the edge.Cagliari captain Luca Ceppitelli tried to protect Kean, rushing to his side and pleading with the fans to stop. Instead, Ceppitelli was almost hit on the head by a bottle thrown from the stands.In his comments partially blaming Kean, Bonucci said: ""There were racist boos after Kean's celebration and (Blaise) Matuidi got angry but I think the blame is 50-50.""He added: ""Kean made a mistake and the fans made a mistake.""Matuidi, who is also black and won the World Cup with France last year, was subjected to racist abuse in Cagliari last year.The incident involving Kean is but the latest example of racism in soccer this season. Last week, several England players were targeted with monkey chants during the team's 5-1 victory in Montenegro.Former Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, a four-time African player of the year from Ivory Coast, said players who are being targeted should walk off the field.""Yeah, let's do this,"" Toure said at a UEFA conference on diversity in soccer. ""When something like that happens we have to send a strong message.""As criticism mounted Wednesday, Bonucci posted a photo on an Instagram story of him and Kean embracing.""Regardless of everything, in any case... NO TO RACISM,"" Bonucci wrote.Another teammate from both Juventus and Italy's national team, Giorgio Chiellini, defended Kean in a story posted on the club's website, calling him ""a positive figure of Italian football.""""The only thing he did wrong today was the simulation (faking injury), that he surely won't repeat, but he's here to learn,"" Chiellini said. ""He's a very positive figure and he certainly didn't deserve the insults he received.""Kean, who scored in both of Italy's qualifying matches for the 2020 European Championship, also won backing from Mario Balotelli — another black Italian born to African parents and who played for the country's national team.""And tell Bonucci that his luck is that I wasn't there,"" Balotelli wrote on Instagram. ""Instead of defending you he does this? I'm shocked I swear. I love you brother!""Kean hasn't spoken publicly about the incident, but posted a photo of his goal celebration on Instagram.""The best way to respond to racism,"" Kean wrote, ""#notoracism.""___"
"Dorm Fire Kills 10 Young Players in Brazil, Sending Shudder Through Soccer World - The New York Times
RIO DE JANEIRO — Fire consumed a dormitory early Friday at a Brazilian training center for teenage soccer players run by one of South America’s most prominent teams, killing at least 10 in a disaster that reverberated through the soccer world and beyond.The fire in the dormitory, which may have been constructed improperly on what was intended to be a parking lot, was the latest in a string of seemingly preventable tragedies that have convulsed Brazil over the past two weeks.It struck the training center of the Flamengo club in Rio de Janeiro, breaking out in the early morning when many youth players, ages 14 to 17, were asleep. Three others were injured, one seriously, and were taken to a hospital.Officials would not confirm the identities of the dead. But Globoesporte, a Brazilian sports news website, said all were players. The dorm housed 26 players and 13 escaped unharmed, the website said.“The location was completely consumed in flames,” Douglas Henaut, a lieutenant with firefighters, told journalists at the scene. “Unfortunately, we weren’t able to rescue anyone inside. As much as we tried to enter and locate the victims, it wasn’t possible. The bodies were found totally charred.”Flamengo is one of Brazil’s most popular soccer clubs and is considered a symbol of the country’s global dominance in the training and development of young athletes who aspire to join professional soccer.Some of Brazil’s biggest stars have played with Flamengo, among them Romário, Ronaldinho and Zico, who represented the country in World Cups, and many others who have played for high-profile teams abroad.The club’s training center, known as Ninho do Urubu, or Vulture’s Nest, in the western part of the city, had recently undergone renovations. Rio officials confirmed local news reports that the dormitory had been erected in what was supposed to be a parking lot, with no permits for construction, and was going to be torn down after the occupants moved into a new dorm.“The fire was in my room,” Felipe Cardoso, 15, who plays for the Flamengo youth team, wrote on Twitter. “I have only God to thank for managing to wake up and escape death, may God comfort my brothers.”For players accepted to the youth team, it was the Brazilian equivalent of joining the Dallas Cowboys. A video posted by a team member who was away when the fire erupted showed their exuberant camaraderie in the dorm.President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who is hospitalized after intestinal surgery, posted a condolence message on social media: “This morning we were made aware of the sad tragedy in the Flamengo training center, taking the young lives of those who were beginning the path toward the realization of their professional dreams.”Firefighters said they were alerted to the blaze at 5:17 a.m. local time, and Rio de Janeiro prosecutors said they had created a task force to investigate the cause.The fire comes two weeks after a dam broke in the most lethal mining disaster in Brazil’s history, and just two days after a powerful summer storm in Rio de Janeiro set off flooding and mudslides, killing six.The disasters have shocked and saddened Brazilians and have highlighted the country’s shoddy infrastructure and poor emergency response.“We are seeing a succession of avoidable, preventable facts and disasters, and we must pay attention to them so that the institutions of control, enforcement and punishment really work in Brazil,” the country’s prosecutor general, Raquel Dodge, said in Brasília, the capital, after news of the fire spread.The blaze also focused attention on living conditions for young Brazilian soccer players, many of whom come from underprivileged backgrounds and live in dormitories like Flamengo’s across the vast country.“It’s hard to imagine what Flamengo means for these boys,” said Juca Kfouri, a Brazilian sports columnist and author. “In Brazil, there are only two legal paths to social improvement for them: entertainment and soccer. Otherwise it’s a life of crime.”Mr. Kfouri said he was not familiar with the dormitory at the Flamengo training ground, but he said that living conditions at soccer clubs in Brazil historically were atrocious — including a case in which boys were housed in one dormitory built underneath the stands and another infested with rats.“Training at Flamengo is realizing your life’s goal,” Mr. Kfouri said. “But now it’s a dream turned into a nightmare.”He added that the death toll in the fire was most likely lower than it could have been because training had been suspended after the widespread flooding in Rio, and some boys had gone home.Zico, one of Brazil’s soccer legends, sent reporters a video lamenting the tragedy. He said he had met some of the boys who died in the fire. “We ended up getting close to them,” he said. “Boys with dreams, goals, a lot of them trying to help their families.”Rival clubs expressed sympathy on social media. The messages included one from Chapecoense, which suffered its own tragedy just over two years ago when a plane carrying team members to an international competition ran out of fuel and crashed, killing nearly all of the 77 people on board.One of soccer’s most recent breakout stars, the Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior, who was developed in Flamengo’s youth ranks and lived at the academy, took to Twitter to express his horror at the fire. He wrote that he was in shock and called for prayers.While Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, is known for its exports of meat, metal and coffee, nothing garners as much attention as the soccer players it dispatches at a rate unmatched anywhere.Brazilian players form the backbone of soccer’s $7 billion player trading industry. Last year alone 832 players left on overseas adventures, according to data provided by soccer’s global governing body, FIFA.While a few, like the star forward Neymar, will make it to the biggest stages of the game, most are soccer’s workhorses, providing a Brazilian touch to professional teams from East Timor to the Faroe Islands looking to fill their rosters with reliable, well-coached and relatively inexpensive talent.Back home in Brazil, rampant inequality and a lack of other opportunities mean, the supply of young, gifted soccer players looking for a way out of grinding poverty is almost limitless.Flamengo’s newly renovated facility opened late last year, at a cost of about $6 million, and was part of a complete overhaul of the club’s youth development system.Besides five training fields, a swimming pool and gym facilities, the complex was to contain accommodations for 48 players to live on site: 36 single bedrooms, and six doubles.Occupants of the dorm that burned had been scheduled to move into a new building next month, according to local news media reports.Flamengo also had engaged Double Pass, a Belgian consulting firm that specializes in soccer youth development, to modernize the way it trained players.Alexandre Wrobel, a vice president at the club, has been quoted by Brazilian media as saying the youth training facility it would be among the top five in soccer.Such modern surroundings remain comparatively rare in South America, where many clubs cannot call on the lucrative television deals and sponsorship arrangements that bankroll teams in Europe."
"Marco Reus Has Been Kicked Hard by Soccer. He’s Still Standing. - The New York Times
DORTMUND, Germany — There are times these days when Marco Reus finds himself in the middle of the field at Borussia Dortmund’s Signal Iduna Park, watching as Jadon Sancho and Jacob Bruun Larsen and Achraf Hakimi tear around him, a blur of yellow and black, and remembering what it was like to be young.Not that Reus is what most of us would call old; he is not quite what his peers would call old, either. That is how he feels, though. “I am old, my friend,” he said. “In our business, now, when you are 29 or 30, you are old.” He delivers it with a smile, an acknowledgment that he is hamming it up, just a little, but the sentiment is real.Reus feels old in the sense that he is starkly aware that he is no longer young. He knows that whenever he sees Sancho, Larsen and the rest of Dortmund’s shooting stars, the way they play with boldness and fearlessness. They look to him like “young horses,” wild and free.Reus knows that feeling well, that glorious weightlessness, unencumbered by thoughts of “what will happen later, what happens after you finish,” the end so distant that you cannot believe it will ever come.He was like that once, when he was one of the standard-bearers of the new German generation that was going to lift the World Cup in 2014, a winger of pace and cunning and dead-eyed finishing, first with Borussia Mönchengladbach and then as part — a key part — of Jürgen Klopp’s Dortmund team.He remembers it well enough to know that he no longer has it, that it has disappeared at some point along the way. And yet it is hard to conceive of Reus as a “veteran,” as he puts it. Partly, that is because he does not really look the part. His hair is a little darker than it used to be, no longer colored a bright blond, but his face is still smooth-skinned, and his voice is still soft, boyish. He hardly fits the stereotype of the grizzled, wizened pro.And partly it is because it feels as if Reus, even on the cusp of his 30th birthday, is still somehow a talent-in-waiting, his potential not yet fully tapped. For a player regarded as one of Europe’s best for much of the last decade, he has an air of one of the sport’s lost boys.When Dortmund re-signed Reus — he was released from its youth system as a teenager — after its last Bundesliga title, in 2012, he was supposed to be the player who lifted the club to the next level.Klopp believed Reus represented a scarcely believable bargain — “his real market value is much higher” than the nearly $20 million he cost, he said — while the Dortmund chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, felt Reus might be able to “define an era” for the club, in the way that “Uwe Seeler did at Hamburg and Steven Gerrard at Liverpool.”Franz Beckenbauer identified him, along with Mario Götze, as Germany’s brightest hopes. The two helped Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final; Reus was penciled in as a starter in Joachim Löw’s Germany team for the 2014 World Cup.And then, 10 hours before Germany was scheduled to travel to Brazil, Reus tore his ankle ligaments in his final pretournament friendly. He punched the ground in frustration. Germany’s team flew without him. It came home a month later as the world champion.Reus did his rehab, returned to fitness, seemed ready to break through into the elite once more. Before the European Championship in 2016, Löw said that Reus “hugely enriched” the Germany side. But he missed that tournament through injury, too (Germany reached the semifinals).Another recovery, another fresh start. In 2017, EA Sports made him the cover star of that year’s edition of its FIFA game, an honor usually afforded to Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo; that was the sort of company Reus was expected to keep. Dortmund made the German Cup final that year. Reus, after so many delays, had the first silverware of his career in his grasp.He picked up an injury in the first half. At halftime, Dortmund’s doctors informed him that they believed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament, and that he would be sidelined for six months, eight months, maybe more. He called his parents, and his girlfriend, Scarlett, and cried. “It’s bad,” he told them. Dortmund went on to win.That evening, Reus stopped to talk to reporters. They asked him if he knew the extent of the injury. “It is just a little cruciate,” he told them. Dortmund’s communications team was baffled. There is, they knew, and Reus knew, no such thing as a little cruciate injury.“Negative experiences teach you what to say,” Reus said, explaining how he could be so relaxed. It was not, though, an act of bravado. He had suffered injuries before, setbacks bad enough that he had once said he would happily trade all of the money he had made during his career for his fitness.This injury was the worst of all of them, and yet it had, he said, “caused something in my head to accept it.” That is not to say he did not suffer. In the hospital, a couple of days later, “once the adrenaline had worn off,” Reus felt that familiar bleakness setting in. He still had times when he “got emotional, angry, screamed, cried,” but he knew that he had to get it out, get over it, get on with it.“If it stays inside, you get sad, and you never get to the point where you can make the next step,” he said. “You can be sad for a couple of days, and nobody will be angry with you. But for weeks and months? It does not help.”He did not, though — not then, not during any of his injuries, not during any of the time that he lost — start to feel he was cursed. He never asked why this was happening to him, why he had so much snatched away from him, why fate seemed arranged that he would remain a what if, one of those players who never quite becomes — through no fault of his own — what he was supposed to be.“It is human to think about what I have missed,” he said. “But if I regret too much, think about what I have lost, I lose focus on what I need to do. You cannot rewind. This is not a computer game that you can play again. All I can do is try to be better, to be luckier, next time.”That is not the only change in perspective injury has afforded him. “You have a lot of time to think about other things, too,” he said. Over the eight months of his rehabilitation, Reus — by his own estimation — grew up. “You become aware of what you are doing, and what comes next, and when that will start,” he said.He turns 30 in May. By that stage, if all goes well, he will have become a father for the first time. He is no longer young, even if he is not quite old. “I have three or four years left,” he said of his playing career. “That is still quite a period, but football goes fast.”He has made no firm decisions on what he will do when his career ends — he would prefer not to go into senior management, but coach children, if he stays in soccer, because that is when “you should be having the most fun” — though he has a few ideas. He has not forgotten what it is to be footloose, carefree, but that does not mean he envies Sancho, Larsen and his other young teammates. He does not resent the clock for ticking.“The injuries have taught me to enjoy the time I have on the field, the time I am training with the guys,” he said. “As you get older, you learn it will end at some point, and so you cherish the moments you are healthy.” Those young horses are lucky, he knows, to feel it will never end. But he would not trade places with them. When you know that time is limited, and time is precious, you appreciate it all the more."
"Mike Ashley-Backed Goals Soccer Centres Suspends Shares - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Five-a-side football pitch operator Goals Soccer Centres suspended trading in its shares on Wednesday after saying it had identified ""substantial misdeclaration"" of value added tax (VAT) as part of an ongoing investigation into historical accounting errors.The company, in which Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has an 18.92 percent stake, said it was yet to establish the final value of misdeclarations but that the value identified so far was about 12 million pounds.The AIM-listed company, whose 5-a-side pitches and FA affiliated leagues are a familiar feature of UK towns and cities, said on March 8 it was investigating historical accounting errors whose financial impact was significant.The company, which replaced KPMG with BDO as its auditor in June last year, has also warned that its 2018 results will be materially below expectations.The Scotland-based company said it would enter into discussions with the government and that it remained in talks with its lenders over new facilities.It said it would now adopt new VAT accounting policies which may impact its profitability going forward. However, it said trading in the UK and the United States since March 8 had been strong compared to last year.Established in 2000, Goals is currently led by ex-Disney executive and former Manchester United Commercial Director Andy Anson and has 50 sites globally.

"Soccer Player Who Faced Extradition From Thailand to Bahrain Is Back in Australia - The New York Times
A soccer player who was jailed in Thailand and faced being sent back to his native Bahrain, where he said he would be imprisoned and tortured, was released Monday after Thai prosecutors dropped the extradition case against him.On Tuesday afternoon, the player, Hakeem al-Araibi, arrived back in Australia, where he has refugee status. He was greeted at the airport in Melbourne by a swarm of well-wishers, who started singing, “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” a popular soccer anthem.“Amazing to see all the people here,” he said. “I’m going to die in Australia. Australia is my country,” he added. “I love Australia.”Mr. al-Araibi, 25, who had been a star defender for the Bahrain national soccer team, fled the small Gulf nation in 2011 during a crackdown on Arab Spring protesters. He said he had been tortured by government security forces. He has been playing soccer for a minor team in Melbourne, Australia.After his arrest in November at an airport in Bangkok, he became the focus of lobbying by diplomats, prominent sports figures and a social media campaign under the hashtag #savehakeem.Mr. al-Araibi left for Australia as soon as his departure was approved.“This is the best outcome,” said his lawyer, Natalie Bergman. “It should have happened from the beginning, but later is better than nothing.”After Mr. al-Araibi’s arrival in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne released a joint statement commending the Thai government for its decision and noting the “constructive dialogue that we have had with Bahrain in helping to resolve this issue.”The statement added: “We know all Australians will deeply appreciate the decision, allowing him to return to his wife, family and friends.”Mr. al-Araibi traveled to Thailand last year for a honeymoon and was detained with his wife. She was released, but Mr. al-Araibi remained in detention as Bahrain pursued his extradition.He had been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison for charges including the burning of a police station, which he said occurred while he was playing in a televised match.The royal family of Bahrain, which is Sunni Muslim, has pursued an aggressive crackdown against calls for democracy from the kingdom’s Shiite Muslim majority, including a campaign of widespread arrests and many convictions on what human rights groups say are trumped-up charges.Thailand, which has been run by a military junta since a 2014 coup, has sent people fleeing political oppression back to countries including China, raising fears that Mr. al-Araibi would also be returned.But the country has also shown signs that it can be moved by international pressure.Last month, a Saudi woman who said she was fleeing abuse from her family barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room and rallied support to her cause online. The woman, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, was allowed to leave the airport after a two-day standoff and was granted asylum in Canada.Mr. al-Araibi received widespread support from the international sports world, including FIFA, the international body that oversees global soccer; the International Olympic Committee; and the World Players Association, an umbrella group representing 85,000 professional athletes worldwide.Jamie Vardy, a striker for the English Premier League club Leicester City, expressed support for Mr. al-Araibi on Twitter, and Craig Foster, a broadcaster and former captain of the Australian national men’s team, was a prominent advocate for his release.“This is a big victory for that global campaign and marks the fact that football will have to play an important role in human rights going forward,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “They call football the beautiful game, and it is a beautiful day for the beautiful game.”Mr. Foster, who lobbied FIFA officials and shouted his support to Mr. al-Araibi when he appeared at a hearing last week in leg shackles, expressed his gratitude to the Thai government for dropping the case.“Most important thing now is Hakeem’s immediate well-being,” Mr. Foster said on Twitter after the ruling was announced. “Sure embassy staff will take care of him, there’ll be tears there tonight, as there are in our household right now.”When Mr. al-Araibi arrived in Melbourne, Mr. Foster placed his arms around his shoulders.“To see him back here on home soil today speaks volumes about the character, the values and the pride that we have as Australians,” Mr. Foster said.The Thai foreign minister, Don Pramudwinai, visited Bahrain and met on Sunday with Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the crown prince, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported. No details of their discussion were released.The decision to drop the case came after the government of Bahrain told Thai diplomats that it did not want to pursue it, said Chatchom Akapin, director general for international affairs for the Thai attorney general’s office.“We got information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning that Bahrain is not interested in extraditing Hakeem anymore,” he said. “Therefore, the attorney general office decided it was no use to pursue the case.”"
"Jury Fail to Reach Verdict on Police Chief Accused Over UK Deadly Soccer Stadium Crush - The New York Times
PRESTON, England — A jury at the trial of a former police chief in charge of operations at the 1989 Hillsborough soccer stadium crush that killed 96 Liverpool supporters failed on Wednesday to reach a verdict on whether he was guilty of manslaughter.The victims, many young, died in an overcrowded, fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, northern England, at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on a warm, sunny afternoon in April 27 years ago.Harrowing images of young fans crushed against metal fences, bodies lying on the pitch and spectators using wooden advertising hoardings as makeshift stretchers horrified the nation.Police at first blamed the disaster on drunken fans, an explanation that was always rejected by survivors, relatives of the victims and the wider Liverpool community who spent years fighting to find out what had happened.Later inquests and a damning independent inquiry absolved the fans of any responsibility.After a 10-week trial and eight days of deliberation, a jury at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday failed to reach a decision on charges of manslaughter by gross negligence against former Chief Supt. David Duckenfield, the police officer in charge on the day. He had denied the charge. ""We have discussed the matter carefully with counsel and I can confirm the CPS will seek a retrial against Mr Duckenfield,"" Sue Hemming from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement.The jury did, however, find former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell guilty of a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act.The Hillsborough tragedy, which happened within minutes of kick-off, changed the face of English soccer. Banks of terracing and metal fences around pitches disappeared, replaced by modern, all-seated venues and better security.The jury had heard that 96 died as a result of a crush. However, under the law at the time, there could be no prosecution for the 96th victim as he died over a year after the tragedy.""While forthcoming legal proceedings restrict comment on the outcome of the trial, we acknowledge the guilty verdict for Graham Mackrell and can empathise with the frustration shared by everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy that the outcome was not definitive,"" Liverpool FC said in a statement https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/342932-liverpool-fc-statement-hillsborough-trial.""Furthermore, the journey not only to reach today’s stage and continue, is testament to the perseverance and determination of all involved in the ongoing campaign for justice which is now into its 30th year.""

"Search for Emiliano Sala and Pilot Is Called Off - The New York Times
LONDON — The authorities announced on Thursday that they had ended the search for the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot after their aircraft vanished over the English Channel on Monday.“We reviewed all the information available to us, as well as knowing what emergency equipment was on board, and have taken the difficult decision to end the search,” David Barker, the harbormaster captain of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement posted by the police on Twitter.The search, which involved three planes, five helicopters, two lifeboats and the assistance of passing ships and fishing boats, covered an approximately 1,700-square-mile area, according to Mr. Barker.The police examined mobile phone data and satellite imagery, but no trace of the aircraft, Mr. Sala or the pilot, David Ibbotson, could be found.“The chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote,” Mr. Barker said in his statement.After the authorities’ announcement, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala’s sister, held a news conference in Cardiff and asked the authorities not to call off the search.“Please, please, please don’t stop the search,” Ms. Sala said in Spanish, fighting back tears.She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.On Monday night, when his plane disappeared, Mr. Sala sent an  audio message to his family from the plane, in which he said, “I’m so afraid” and warned that the aircraft “seems like it’s falling to pieces.”“If, in an hour and a half, you have no news from me,” he said, “I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me, because they are not going to find me.”Mr. Ibbotson, whose identity was confirmed by the Humberside Police on Wednesday, used the Facebook check-in tool at the Nantes airport on Saturday afternoon. According to reports in the British news media, he had joked in Facebook comments that he was a “bit rusty with the ils,” referring to the Instrument Landing System.The Piper Malibu plane — a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft — departed Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Monday, and was headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales.Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward from Argentina, had left his homeland for Europe at the age of 16. He became a star playing for Nantes in the top French league, and was recently sold to Cardiff City. He was scheduled to join that team on Tuesday.By 8:23 p.m. Monday in Britain, his plane had disappeared from air traffic control radar about 15 miles north of Guernsey.Mehmet Dalman, the chairman of Cardiff City, said on Wednesday that there were no plans to reschedule the team’s coming Premier League match, which is set to take place on Tuesday, according to the BBC.“I would be very surprised if there’s any change to the schedule,” Mr. Dalman said.The owner of Cardiff City, Tan Sri Vincent Tan, thanked those involved in the search operation in a statement on Thursday.“Monday evening’s news shook everyone at Cardiff City F.C. to the core,” he said. “We were looking forward to providing Emiliano with the next step in his life and career.”He added that the team continued to pray for Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson.The search for the aircraft, Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson might have been called off, but the disappearance remained an open case, according to Mr. Barker, the harbormaster captain.“We will be broadcasting to all vessels and aircraft in the area to keep a look out for any trace of the aircraft,” he said in the statement. “This will continue indefinitely.”"

"Soccer: South Korea's Son Keen to Share the Limelight - The New York Times
SEOUL — As South Korea's captain, Son Heung-min makes a point of sharing the credit for the team's successes and shouldering the blame for the failures and the flying forward did a bit of both after Tuesday's impressive 2-1 win over Colombia.Without a goal for the national team since June, when he sprinted from the halfway line to slot home into an empty German net at the World Cup, Son delivered one of his best performances in a Korean shirt as the home side saw off 12th ranked Colombia in a friendly in Seoul.Scoring the opener with a ferocious right-foot shot from inside the box, Son was a constant menace to the Colombian defence, his pace and movement giving the Koreans the perfect out-ball during periods of sustained pressure.The 26-year-old, who now has 24 goals in 79 international appearances, said he felt his personal struggles in front of goal has been talked about more than the team's recent good run under Portuguese coach Paulo Bento.The Koreans have won nine of their 14 games under Bento, who took over after the World Cup, their only defeat coming in the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup to eventual champions Qatar.""I felt like I was being a distraction to the rest of the team, because people kept mentioning my name when talking about the national team,"" Yonhap News quoted Son as saying after Tuesday's win. ""I couldn't have scored the goal today without the sacrifices of my team mates.""Son has mostly been used as a winger at international level but has been asked to play a more central role in Bento's experimental 4-4-2 formation against Colombia and Bolivia last Friday.While he did not find the net against the Bolivians, Son was at the heart of Korea's most dangerous moves before substitute Lee Chung-yong popped up with a late winner in a 1-0 victory.Son said he would play anywhere to help the team.""On my club, I've played both as a striker in a two-forward setting and as a winger,"" Son said. ""No matter where the coach puts me, my job is to do the best I can in that position. I think it's important for me to keep playing the way I did today. That kind of consistency will help the national team and myself as a player."" (Writing by Peter Rutherford; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"

"Soccer: Veteran Quagliarella Helps Rejuvenated Italy Thrash Liechtenstein - The New York Times
PARMA, Italy — Fabio Quagliarella became Italy's oldest goalscorer as his double helped Roberto Mancini's rejuvenated side thrash 10-man Liechtenstein 6-0 in their second Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday.Quagliarella, 36, netted two first-half penalties, while 19-year-old Moise Kean scored his second goal in his third appearance. Stefano Sensi, Marco Verratti and Leonardo Pavoletti also found the net.Liechtenstein were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of halftime when Daniel Kaufmann was sent off for a handball on his goalline.Italy, who have a maximum six points in Group J after a 2-0 win against Finland on Saturday, controlled the midfield through Verratti while Quagliarella set an example with his aggression.The Azzurri, who are rebuilding under Mancini after missing out on the 2018 World Cup, broke the deadlock after 17 minutes as the 23-year-old Sensi's header from Leonardo Spinazzola's cross from the left found the roof of the net. Verratti doubled the tally with a fine curled shot into the far side of the goal on 32 minutes.Quagliarella scored his first goal from the penalty spot after a Nicolas Hasler handball, and his second after Kaufmann also used his arm and was shown a straight red card.Christian Panucci was Italy's previous oldest goalscorer at 35 years 62 days.

"Abby Wambach’s Leadership Lessons: Be the Wolf - The New York Times
You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.“So many of us can relate to playing by rules that were never set up for us to win.”— Abby Wambach, two-time Olympic gold medalist and World Cup championAbby Wambach has made a career out of pursuing goals. She’s scored 184 of them after all, the most by any soccer player, male or female, in international soccer history. But now, a few years into her retirement, Wambach, who led the United States women’s team to a World Cup championship in 2015, is focused on a new kind of goal: motivating women to become leaders. “There has never been a more important, urgent time than right now for women to begin to fully lead our own lives,” she told me this week.In her new book, “Wolfpack,” Wambach, 38, shares lessons she learned from decades of training, failure and triumph on the field. It is based on the commencement speech she gave at Barnard College in New York last year that quickly went viral. “If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ‘Abby, you were never Little Red Riding Hood; you were always the wolf,’” she told graduates.[FROM THE ARCHIVES: Abby Wambach, Retired U.S. Soccer Star, Reflects on Her Addiction]Her book’s release comes a month after the United States women’s team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation. While Wambach is not part of the suit, she’s been outspoken on the subject. “This isn’t just a female athlete’s story; this is every single woman’s story on planet Earth,” she said in September. “Women lose our very lives because of this pay gap inequity, and in order to get it back we have to fight.”In “Wolfpack,” Wambach offers eight new rules to help women succeed professionally and personally. And she hopes her ideas trigger a domino effect. “When one person stands up and demands the ball, the job, the promotion, the paycheck, the microphone, that one gives others permission to do the same,” she said. Here are the four of her “new rules,” and the norms she hopes they’ll upend. ______“Champion each other.” Old Rule: Be against each other. New Rule: Be FOR each other.“Power and success and joy are not pies,” Wambach writes. “A bigger slice for one woman doesn’t mean a smaller slice for another.”______“Be grateful and ambitious.” Old Rule: Be grateful for what you have. New Rule: Be grateful for what you have AND demand what you deserve.“I was so grateful for a paycheck, so grateful to represent my country, so grateful to be the token woman at the table, so grateful to receive any respect at all that I was afraid to use my voice to demand more,” Wambach writes. “Our gratitude is how power uses the tokenism of a few women to keep the rest of us in line.”______“Make failure your fuel.” Old Rule: Failure means you’re out of the game. New Rule: Failure means you’re finally IN the game.“Imperfect men have been empowered and permitted to run the world since the beginning of time,” Wambach writes. “It’s time for imperfect women to grant themselves permission to join them.”______“Lead from the bench.” Old Rule: Wait for permission to lead. New Rule: Lead now — from wherever you are.“The picture of leadership is not just a man at the head of a table,” Wambach writes. “It’s also every woman who is allowing her own voice to guide her life and the lives of those she cares about.”Sign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!______Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed.______What would happen if women gained the same physical strength as men? That was the question posed in an 1870 article in The New York Times titled “Muscular Women” (!). The answer, according to the opponents of equal rights at the time, would be a disruption of the natural order of things, meaning women would exert their strength to take down men physically and mentally.

"Emiliano Sala’s Grieving Argentine Hometown Bids Farewell - The New York Times
A small village in Argentina on Saturday bid farewell to a favorite son, the soccer striker Emiliano Sala, who died along with his pilot last month when his small plane crashed in the English Channel.Friends, family and supporters gathered early Saturday in the village of Progreso, in the country’s northeast, for a wake at Mr. Sala’s soccer boyhood club, San Martín de Progreso, where his body lay in state. A religious ceremony was held in the afternoon, and he was to be cremated, reports said.Outside the club, a banner read, “Emi, you will never walk alone.”Mr. Sala’s body arrived in the village on Friday, a little more than a week after his remains were found in the wreckage of the plane that went down shortly after takeoff from Nantes, France, for Cardiff, Wales.“We are waiting for you, Emi,” the San Martín club posted on Facebook ahead of the body’s arrival.The club’s president, Daniel Ribero told Agence France-Presse, “He represented a lot for us. We’re a small village and Emi was a celebrity, the only player to turn professional.”Mr. Sala, 28, started off as a youth player in his native Argentina and began his international career in France in 2010. He recently transferred to the English Premier League club Cardiff City from Nantes in the French league. The Cardiff club signed him for £15 million ($19 million) to add to its striking power.Representatives of both clubs attended the funeral service, the BBC reported and FC Nantes and fans paid tribute to Mr. Sala on Twitter.On Thursday, as two of his former French teams — SN Caen and FC Nantes — faced each other at Caen on France’s west coast, signs paying tribute to the striker lined the pitch and players and fans joined in applause before the match began.Mr. Sala was flying to Cardiff with a pilot, David Ibbotson, on Jan. 21, when their single-engine, propeller-driven Piper Malibu vanished. An initial search for survivors was called off, but after pleas from Mr. Sala's family and a funding drive that raised more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000 in donations, the search resumed.Recovery crews sent by the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the wreckage of the plane and recovered Mr. Sala’s body.An inquest into the crash has been adjourned until November, when police and air investigators will release more details about the accident.The pilot is still missing, and Mr. Ibbotson’s family were seeking donations to help find and recover his body.“We know that he’s dead; we do know that, but we just want him home,” Nora Ibbotson, the pilot’s wife, told a morning television show on the British network ITV on Monday. With the help of famous soccer players and fans, the fund-raiser was close to hitting its target of 400,000 pounds, around $515,000, according to its GoFundMe page.Although the wreckage of the Piper Malibu was not raised from the ocean bed, British investigators said underwater footage of the aircraft would help their work. The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it would publish early findings in the coming week."
"Soccer: Alex Morgan Scores 100th International Goal as U.S. Beat Australia - The New York Times
(Reuters) - Forward Alex Morgan reached a personal milestone with her 100th international goal as the United States beat Australia 5-3 in a friendly in Colorado on Thursday.In opening the scoring in the 15th minute with a superb solo run capped by a precise finish, Morgan became the seventh American woman -- 17th from any country -- to reach the century mark.It was far from smooth sailing for the reigning World Cup champions, who fell behind Australia early in the second half in front of a sellout crowd in suburban Denver.The home team, however, scored three times in 14 minutes to regain the lead for good in an entertaining encounter between two of the favorites heading into World Cup in France in June.Local favorite Mallory Pugh made it 4-2 by scoring less than a minute after coming on, before adding a second with a deft dink over the keeper in the final minute of stoppage time to seal the result.Earlier, Australia equalized on the half hour when pacy veteran winger Lisa De Vanna fired home.Caitlin Foord gave Australia the lead early in the second half, before Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe put the U.S. ahead again.Samantha Kerr scored with a thumping header in the 82nd minute to give Australia some hope, but the visitors could not find an equalizer.""We can't let that many goals in ... but they're a great attacking team so you've got to give them credit,"" said veteran Rapinoe after her 150th appearance for the U.S.The Americans continue their World Cup preparation with another friendly against Belgium in California on Sunday.

"Lionel Messi’s Goals Go Viral Like No Other Player’s - The New York Times
There is no shortage of Lionel Messi content on the World Wide Web. The 31-year-old soccer superstar ranks high in surveys of top Google searches, one of just a few human beings to earn a spot among such keyword perennials as “Facebook,” “weather” and “free porn.” In a 2015 tally of the most Googled person in each nation on earth, Messi tied Kim Kardashian for the most No. 1s, with a global reach that extended from his native Argentina to Haiti, Turkmenistan, Senegal and 22 other countries.Messi is also one of the world’s pre-eminent viral video stars. Countless clips document “Messi magic,” a playing style of almost unseemly brilliance. On social media, users share videos of Messi’s slipping passes through improbably tight spaces, corkscrewing shots past sprawling goalkeepers, darting around defenders like a jack rabbit navigating a gantlet of sloths. Type “Messi” into a YouTube search field, and you will find hundreds of highlight compilations with bombastic titles: “Lionel Messi sees things we don’t even consider,” “Lionel Messi: — A God Amongst Men,” “Lionel Messi: Extraterrestrial.”So it was not exactly surprising when, on March 17, the internet was captivated by a Messi goal. It came in the 85th minute of a 4-1 victory for Messi’s club team, FC Barcelona, over the Seville-based Real Betis. Messi gathered the ball about 24 yards from the Betis goal, slid a pass to his teammate Ivan Rakitić and then flowed forward to receive a return pass. The goal that followed was so easeful, so understated, that it was momentarily hard to process. Messi struck the ball in full stride but with shocking delicacy, lifting a chip shot that arced gracefully across the penalty area. The ball drifted beyond the reach of the goalie, Pau López, scraped the underside of the crossbar and dropped into the goal. Messi had taken his shot from a diagonal position more than 20 yards away, but it was not the stinging kick generally required to score from that spot. The ball’s trajectory was languid and dreamy, like a gull gliding on an ocean breeze.Messi had already scored twice in the game. But the beauty and impudence of this goal — by some counts, the 656th of Messi’s professional career — was clear to all. Betis supporters stood to applaud their tormentor. Soccer pundits reached for celestial metaphors. On ESPN.com, the journalist Musa Okwonga wrote that “the ball, with the glorious inevitability of our slowly dying sun, rose and fell.” The wildest exultations came from the operatic English TV commentator Ray Hudson, who unleashed a torrent of mixed metaphors. “The staggering genius of Lionel Messi!” he cried, during a live broadcast on the beIN SPORTS network. “This miraculous footballer, this halo of a footballer! ... He’s got an algebraic equation to solve in the blink of a baby’s eye, and he does it in a way that is just so poetic!”Hudson is onto something with this talk of algebra and poetry. Messi’s greatness lies in his mind as much as his body. Watching replays of the goal, you marvel above all at the audacity of Messi’s idea. A chip? From that distance, at that angle, in that frenzied moment of open-field play? It’s nuts — a fool’s fantasy that blossoms, with every slow-motion replay, into wondrous fact. Messi saw something we didn’t even consider.That viral clip is a testament to Messi’s supernatural talent. It’s also a reminder that online video is changing the way we consume and conceptualize sports. Decades ago, the culture of “highlights” was already transforming America’s pastimes. The decline of slow-paced baseball, the ascendancy of the razzle-dazzle N.B.A., the rule changes that have brought an offensive explosion in the N.F.L. — these developments were fueled in no small part by the rise of ESPN’s SportsCenter and the primacy of video clips. But in the old days, those highlight packages were appointment viewing, available only on nightly broadcasts. Today highlights spread across the web in seconds, mutating into memes and turning star athletes into visual brands. You don’t have to be a purist to wonder how this media ecosystem is affecting our tolerance for the natural rhythms and longueurs of sports, those lengthy stretches of “lowlight” play that are only occasionally punctuated by thrills.Soccer is a subtle game; in general, goals are hard to come by. It would seem to be the major sport most antithetical to highlight culture. (For all those moments of Messi magic, the essence of his greatness may lie in untelegenic maneuverings off the ball, the cagey movements that put him into positions where he can erupt.) But viral video is altering our view of soccer’s history. Today’s fans compare clips while endlessly debating the “greatest of all time” status of Messi and his chief rival, the Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo. The GOATs of previous eras — like Pelé, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona — recede into the background: They had the misfortune to play in a time before a footballer’s every exploit was captured on video. If a player’s “receipts” aren’t on YouTube, he’s liable to lose to his toehold in the historiography.Yet for the 21st-century soccer fan, online video is a godsend — the only conceivable way to keep up with the ultimate global sport. With a mobile phone and a well-curated social media feed, it is now possible to follow great matches on five different continents, nearly every day, in real time.As for Messi: I know few more pleasurable ways to kill a couple of hours than by squinting at a liquid-crystal screen, bugging out to the likes of “Lionel Messi Humiliating Players Two or More Times in the Same Play.” Messi is the quintessential internet-age soccer star — he scored his first goal for Barcelona in 2005, the year YouTube went online — but his persona is a throwback to an earlier period. He is a trickster and a funnyman, like an old-time silent-movie star. He’s small and scrappy, standing just 5-foot-7, the Charlie Chaplin to suave Ronaldo’s Rudolph Valentino. Many of his greatest moments play out like slapstick farce, leaving pratfalling defenders littered across the pitch.At their best, sports like soccer are the digital age’s most reliable suppliers of an old-fashioned brand of entertainment, the special-effects-free kind, in which human beings use only their sinews and synapses to deliver thrills and spills, action and comedy. Messi’s chip in the Betis match was a comedic set piece in its own right. On YouTube, you can find video montages of the play’s aftermath: Messi and his teammates celebrating and cracking up, the goalie López mugging like an exasperated vaudeville straight man, play-by-play announcers dissolving in peals of laughter. The goal is a cosmic joke if there ever was one. A small man swings his left leg; a ball loops skyward; common sense and natural laws are suspended. You know the punch line: The ball will fall back to earth, landing — plop — in the back of the net. But no matter how many times you watch it, the gag still kills."

"Bundesliga’s Chief Executive Isn’t Keen to Join Premier League - The New York Times
LONDON — The group entrusted with conducting the surprisingly difficult search for a candidate to run English soccer’s Premier League has received another rejection from an executive for whom the opportunity would appear to have been a step up.Earlier this year, the league approached Christian Seifert, chief executive of Germany’s Bundesliga, to see if he would like to step into the shoes of Richard Scudamore, the towering figure under whose leadership England’s top flight managed to become by far the world’s most popular soccer league, not to mention its richest.Seifert briefly thought about the idea before dismissing it, according to people with knowledge of his thinking. He is focused on managing the next set of broadcast rights sales as Germany’s league competes with Spain’s La Liga in the battle for second place behind the Premier League, said the people, who were not authorized to speak about it publicly.A spokeswoman for the Bundesliga and Seifert declined to comment. A Premier League spokesman said the league did not comment on names linked to the role.The search for Scudamore’s replacement has shined a harsh light on the search team, led by Chelsea’s chairman, Bruce Buck, entrusted to find the former advertising executive’s replacement. Last year, the group announced the appointment of Susanna Dinnage, a senior executive at Discovery Communications, before she abruptly changed her mind in late December. That left the league scrambling for a second option. A raft of names have since been linked to the post, but the search continues without any sign of an imminent appointment.At a league board meeting, which was attended by a mix of owners and executives from the Premier League’s 20 teams, those in attendance were told that the search group, which has hired the U.K. headhunting firm Spencer Stuart to help with the process, has interviewed a final group of six candidates who will be shortlisted to three by the end of the month.Scudamore’s replacement will find an increasingly busy inbox, as well as a challenging media climate, as the league attempts to at least keep pace with the multibillion-dollar deals that have fueled its rise. The Premier League recently joined counterparts across Europe in voicing concerns about plans by some of the continent’s top clubs to restructure the elite Champions League, changes that risk diminishing the value and relevance of domestic soccer.The new boss must also manage tension between the league’s biggest clubs — a group of six that includes Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, who have owners from the United States and who are constantly fighting for a larger slice of income at the expense of the rest of the competition. He or she will also be faced with as yet unknown challenges created by the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.But even without a leader, the Premier League continues to provide a compelling product for its worldwide fan base, with this season’s title race set to go to the wire as Manchester City and Liverpool match each other point for point into the final games, while the next four teams are involved in an equally tight fight for the final two qualification places for next season’s Champions League.The delay, though, has been frustrating for some of the league’s staff and companies that do business with it. They had grown used to Scudamore’s decisive management style. For instance, the Premier League recently scrapped a multimillion-dollar agreement with Facebook to broadcast games in four Asian countries after failing to finalize the agreement. An executive involved in the talks, who had completed contracts with Scudamore in the past, said the leadership void did not help the process."
"Soccer-Suarez, Messi Late-Show Sinks Atletico After Costa Sees Red - The New York Times
BARCELONA — Barcelona closed in on the La Liga title after beating 10-man Atletico Madrid 2-0 in Saturday's top-of-the-table showdown at the Nou Camp as late strikes by Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi gave the Catalans an 11-point lead at the top of the table.Atletico began brightly but their gameplan went out of the window when Diego Costa was shown a straight red card in the 28th minute for a verbal tirade at referee Jesus Gil Manzano.Atletico produced a gutsy second-half display, expertly shackling Barca, but the Catalans finally found a way past the visitors' outstanding goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a superb curling shot from Suarez in the 85th minute.Moments later Messi sealed victory and quite probably the league title with an irresistibly cool finish into the net and Barca's fans jubilantly chanted ""champions"", crowing at their surely unassailable lead at the top with seven games remaining.Atletico midfielder Koke conceded that Barca had wrapped up the title but questioned the decision to send Costa off.""Barca are practically champions. It was a very strange game, we were doing so well until the red card but all the small details went their way,"" Koke told reporters.""Whenever we come here something strange happens, we've had a lot of red cards against Barca and not all of them have been fair. When you have 10 men against one of the best teams in the world it's normal that it's a struggle.""Suarez highlighted his side's character for winning such a difficult game so soon after their gruelling 4-4 draw against Villarreal in midweek.""This was another game which shows just how hard it is to win the league so we deserve lot more credit for what we're achieving,"" Suarez said.""We've now got a very big advantage over Atletico. There are still some games left but we took two steps towards winning the league today."" MAD MOMENTAtletico realistically needed to win at the Nou Camp for the first time since 2006 to stay in the title race and they played with ambition and intelligence in the opening stages, keeping the ball for long periods and depriving Barca of space.But they were rocked by Costa's moment of madness which killed their early momentum and left them with little choice but to defend for the remaining hour of the game.Striker Costa reacted angrily to not being awarded a foul after being tackled by Jordi Alba and gave a long verbal response to the referee, who to his disbelief pulled out a red card.Costa had to be shepherded off the pitch by Barca's Gerard Pique as he struggled to control his temper while his team mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez earned bookings for venting their anger over the decision. Atletico coped superbly with the setback and numerical disadvantage, controlling the space for the majority of the game.Messi still carved his way through the middle of the pitch on two occasions, creating openings for Suarez and himself but both South American forwards were thwarted by the titanic presence of Oblak.Atletico naturally had limited opportunities down the other end but were not far from finding a goal when Antoine Griezmann picked out Rodrigo from a free kick but the midfielder headed over the bar when Gimenez was stood behind him, in a better position.Diego Simeone's side could not last the distance, however, and as their legs inevitably tired, Barca's attacking quality made the difference.""We knew what the game would be like, Atletico are very organised and after the red card we tried to attack more but it wasn't easy,"" Suarez said.""But we kept going, we showed a great attitude and kept testing their goalkeeper who was the hero of the game.""

"U.A.E. Accuses Qatar of Fielding Ineligible Players at Asian Cup - The New York Times
Two days after fans in the United Arab Emirates threw shoes at rival players during a 4-0 loss in the semifinals to Qatar at the Asian Cup, the country’s soccer federation has taken direct aim at the team itself.Organizers of the Asian Cup said on Thursday that they would respond to an official complaint lodged by Emirates soccer officials, who charged that two members of the Qatari team were ineligible to play in the region’s biggest tournament.The players — Almoez Ali, a Sudan-born striker, and Bassam al-Rawi, a defender born in Iraq — are fixtures in Qatar’s lineup. Ali is the tournament’s top scorer, with eight goals in six games, and al-Rawi scored the goal that sent Qatar to the quarterfinals.The complaint is the latest salvo in a bitter dispute between the Gulf neighbors that goes far beyond soccer. The Emirates is part of a two-year-old, Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, driven by a belief that its neighbor is financing terrorism and growing too close to Iran, Saudi Arabia’s biggest regional rival; Qatar has denied playing any role in supporting terrorist groups.The dispute has already manifested itself in ways small and large in the tournament, which now represents Qatar’s biggest success on the soccer field.One consequence of the dispute is that there are no direct flights from Doha to Abu Dhabi, so Qatar’s team had to fly through Oman on its way to the event, and Qatari fans — unable to travel to the Emirates without permission — are largely absent at the team’s matches.But Qatar, which has never qualified for a World Cup but will host the event in 2022, has been the surprise of the field. It will play Japan in the final on Friday.But even as Qatar marched through the field, rumors — fueled by a close reading of FIFA nationality rules — swirled about the eligibility of Ali and al-Rawi.The silence of Qatari officials on the issue has only led to more rumors. A spokesman for the team has not responded to repeated requests for comment, while FIFA, the global governing body for soccer, has said the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the tournament organizer, the Asian Football Confederation.The A.F.C. had said that it would intervene only an official complaint were filed. That complaint arrived in the aftermath of the Emirates’ humiliating defeat in front of its own fans in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.“The Asian Football Confederation has a received a protest from the United Arab Emirates F.A. regarding the eligibility of two Qatar players,” the A.F.C. said in a statement on Thursday. “This protest will now be reviewed in line with the A.F.C. regulations.”The A.F.C. declined to identify the possible punishment for Qatar. Teams that have previously fielded ineligible players have forfeited games, but the situation has never come up at the final stages of a major international event.Under soccer’s regulations, players are only eligible for a national team outside of their country of birth if they have lived there for five continuous years after turning 18. Al-Rawi is 21 and Ali is 22. The rules make an exception that permits players to represent a country if a parent or grandparent was born there; many countries, including the United States, regularly take advantage of the exception.Qatar has been trawling the world for talent for years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup, embarking on perhaps the most extensive talent identification program in history, one that involved the creation of training programs for youngsters from Africa and an academy for the best prospects in Doha.Officials in the country have said in the past that the program does not require those scouted to pick Qatar over their birth countries. Though born in Sudan, Ali has lived in Qatar since he was a child. Al-Rawi’s father once represented Iraq internationally.Still, Qatar’s squads at the youth and senior levels have included several expatriate players, and the eligibility was not questioned when Ali and al-Rawi represented the country at previous tournaments sanctioned by FIFA and the A.F.C.It was not clear why the Emirates, or any of Qatar’s other opponents — including Saudi Arabia, which lost to Qatar, 2-0 — did not raise the issue until after the semifinal.The victories over the Saudis and the Emirates were greeted by scenes of jubilation in Qatar, where fans draped in the country’s flag took to the streets of Doha to celebrate the victories.For the hosts, the defeat was particularly painful given the efforts it had made to create a partisan atmosphere inside Abu Dhabi’s Zayed Sports City Stadium. Local organizers distributed thousands of free tickets to what it described as “loyal” fans before the game.For the A.F.C., the issue also raises another political issue. Its president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, is being challenged for his post by candidates from the Emirates and Qatar.The organization has opened a separate investigation over the shoe- and bottle-throwing incidents that marred the semifinal. That case could lead to sanctions."
"M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber Gets Five-Year Contract Extension - The New York Times
Don Garber, who in two decades as commissioner has overseen a wave of expansion that has more than doubled the size of Major League Soccer, has signed a five-year contract extension that will keep him in charge of the league through the 2023 season.The league announced the new contract on Thursday. Garber’s previous deal expired after last season, but he had widely been expected to remain in his post. Garber, 61, also will continue in his role as the chairman of Soccer United Marketing, the league’s powerful — and profitable — marketing arm.A former N.F.L. executive, Garber was recruited to join M.L.S. by the N.F.L. owners Robert Kraft and Lamar Hunt, who also owned teams in the then-fledgling soccer league.Garber took over a 12-team M.L.S. in August 1999, and among his first moves was to close the league’s two Florida franchises, in Tampa Bay and Miami. The decision reduced the league’s roster to 10 teams and raised questions about its viability as a national league.But in the two decades that followed, Garber led the league on a wave of expansion — first two teams in 2005, and then a steady flow of at least one new team a year from 2007 to 2012. That burst of growth included the additions of three teams in Canada, in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.All the while, he tinkered with the league’s roster and salary rules, recruited global stars like David Beckham and persuaded the owners to invest in player development and new stadiums. M.L.S. had one soccer-specific stadium in 1999; by this summer, 20 of its teams will play in facilities they control.Garber’s tenure has not been trouble-free. Critics point to the league’s centralized control of player contracts and Soccer United Marketing’s influence with U.S. Soccer as hampering the growth of the domestic game, and Garber once openly feuded with the former United States national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann after the coach criticized the league.But there is little question that Garber’s tenure has transformed the league. The league now has national sponsors and television contracts that bring its games to 170 countries. Twenty-four teams will play in M.L.S. this year, including a new one in Cincinnati, and three more ownership groups have been approved to enter the league by 2021.One of them, led by Beckham, will bring the league back to the Miami market it once abandoned."

"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium Opens: Is There Room for Everyone? - The New York Times
LONDON — Standing outside the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar, Ali Demirci pointed, proudly, to the fresh paint on the window frame. Its color was one of those on-trend grays from an upscale catalog, with a name like Elephant’s Breath or Slipper Satin. “The club came and did it,” Demirci said. He glanced upward to the other minor alteration to the shop he owned until a few weeks ago: a bright white sign. “But I installed that myself.”On the other side of the road, the change has been rather more drastic. The window seats at the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar now offer a view of the gleaming glass frontage of the $1 billion, state-of-the-art stadium that — starting Wednesday evening, when it hosts its inaugural Premier League game — Tottenham Hotspur will call home.The territory is, of course, familiar: The new stadium is on the same patch of land as the atmospheric, historic, old White Hart Lane, where Spurs played for 118 years. The horizon, though, is different: the club hopes the new stadium represents not just a great leap forward for Spurs — proof, in concrete and steel, that this team belongs among Europe’s pre-eminent powers — but for English soccer as a whole.Chris Lee, its chief architect, said he had looked at some 300 stadiums around the world for inspiration and incorporated the best elements he could find into what he labeled the “best” stadium on the planet: an arena supposed to be more modern than Wembley, sleeker than Old Trafford, bigger (crucially) than Arsenal’s home at the Emirates. It is supposed to set what Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, described as a “new standard” for sports stadiums.The arena’s centerpiece is the biggest single-tier stand in England, capable of holding 17,500 fans, modeled on Borussia Dortmund’s Südtribune — known, more commonly, as the Yellow Wall. It claims to be home to the longest bar in Europe. It has a retractable field, allowing it to host not only Premier League matches but N.F.L. games, too. It has its own microbrewery and a restaurant run by a Michelin-starred chef. And, in what is surely a first for a soccer team, Spurs will have its own on-site sommelier.The appeal for Levy and the club, of course, is the financial boost all of that can bring: more fans, spending more time and more money, all of it flowing straight into the team’s coffers. Levy said Tuesday that, with the extra revenue generated by the stadium, Spurs’ income would be in the world’s top 10.This is a team that has long had to wheel and deal in the transfer market. On Sunday, the club’s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted he and his staff had laughed at the sight of Naby Keita and Fabinho, £100 million worth of talent combined, on Liverpool’s bench when the teams met, representing a luxury way beyond Spurs’ means. Tottenham’s new home is, in time, supposed to change that, to turn Spurs into a club that can compete with the elite not just on the field, but off it.The effects of the stadium, though, will resonate beyond Spurs’ balance sheet. The club has long claimed it can be a “catalyst” for the regeneration of the neighborhood around it. At a news media presentation on Tuesday, the club’s executive director, Donna Cullen, opened with a photograph of a burning car: a reminder of the riots that scarred the area — before spreading across the capital and the country — in 2011.That hot, angry summer, Cullen said, was the “trigger” for Spurs to think about what it could do to improve not only its own horizons, but those of the place it represents. The area around Tottenham, Haringey, is the fifth-most deprived borough in London, she said: The club was taken over by a spirit of “let’s see what we can do.”The local authority, Haringay Council, does not entirely accept the idea that Tottenham’s rebirth rests on the stadium. Charles Adje, the councilor responsible for regeneration, said he would not use the word “catalyst” himself, but he acknowledged that it “adds value to the area.”Both the club and the council project that the new stadium could pour around £293 million a year into the local economy; Spurs estimated that it would be responsible for more than 1,700 jobs. “This stadium and this new club is going to make a massive, massive difference to the people of Tottenham,” David Lammy, Tottenham’s member of Parliament, said this week.That, too, will take time, of course. So far, the main visible differences to Tottenham High Road are the new facades on the sandwich bar, the convenience store and a handful of other properties across from the stadium. The streets running to and from it are, otherwise, much the same as always: a jumble of jerk chicken places and nail bars, Polish supermarkets and tumbledown mechanics.Smoking a cigarette outside the barbershop he has run for 25 years, Inan Gulecyuz said he was happy to wait. The stadium opening is, technically, bad news for him: Business drops on game days, he said, and with soccer and the N.F.L. to fit in, he will lose a little trade.That will, he hopes, be offset by the benefits it will bring. “They have changed a lot of the shops just up the road,” he said. “Hopefully the same thing will happen down the road, too.”A little further from the stadium, Irfan Sahin was serving coffee in Fieldseat, his delicatessen, café, bookshop and organic food market. Soft classical music played overhead.Sahin said that he expected the stadium to alter the character of the area, to encourage more businesses to open — “There is no other Michelin-starred restaurant in north London,” he noted — but then, he said, Tottenham is changing anyway: In London, gentrification is a constant tide, regardless of where soccer clubs play.“It is very different from when I first came here in 2001,” he said. “It is slow, of course: We had two gang fights right outside in the last year or so. But there are more places opening all of the time: bars and pubs and cafés and restaurants. It is not as expensive as central London, or as expensive as east London, so it is a good place to open. Hopefully it will be better with the stadium.”Academic literature is unclear on whether that will hold true. Writing in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2000, John Siegfried and Andrew Zimbalist concluded — based largely on case studies in the United States — that while “team owners have argued that sports facilities boost local economic activity, economic reasoning and empirical evidence suggest the opposite.”There are those in Tottenham, certainly, who feel disenfranchised by the speed of change and by redevelopment proposals backed by the council and the club. “There is a real risk of companies going out of business if we cannot find alternative locations in the neighborhood,” said Feruk Tepeyurt, the owner of a local joinery firm and chairman of the Peacock Industrial Estate, home to more than 50 small businesses but, under both the council’s plans and a separate project proposed by the club, scheduled to become a park. “Do we need a park, or do we need a community of small businesses, a lot of them run by local, black and minority ethnic people?”That is the tension inherent in any regeneration, of course: the issue of who, precisely, it is supposed to work for, of whose needs it is meeting. “There is a thin dividing line between seeing the stadium as a catalyst for regeneration and a Trojan horse for social cleansing,” said Mark Panton, an academic at Birkbeck College who has written extensively on the dispute.There is one change left to come: Transport for London, the capital’s transit authority, is expected to accept a proposal to rename White Hart Lane, the nearest train station to the stadium, to Tottenham Hotspur.It is not unprecedented — Arsenal has had its own tube stop, dating to the 1930s — but nor is it universally popular. The objection is based on the idea that erasing the station’s name wipes clean a century or so of history; that it needlessly, ham-fistedly conflates the identities of Tottenham the area and Tottenham the team; that it creates the impression, deep down, below the fresh coats of paint, that the place exists to serve the club, rather than the club existing to reflect the place."

MIAMI — When David Beckham, the former captain of England’s national team, announced his intention to bring a Major League Soccer team to South Florida at a rousing event in downtown Miami five years ago, the excitement was palpable.“I remember thinking how amazing it was going to be,” said Cesar Molero, who runs a fan club named Vice City 1896.When Beckham returned last year for a similar event, where he and many M.L.S. executives were joined by a group of deep-pocketed local investors, there were new plans, new promises and new colors on the scarves.By September, Beckham’s expansion team had a new name (Inter Miami) and a new logo (with twin herons). By January, its new team president had put together the core of a technical staff.And on Wednesday, M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber confirmed what he had been saying for months: that he has the “utmost confidence” that Beckham’s group will produce a team that is a worthy successor to recent M.L.S. start-ups in Atlanta and Los Angeles.But just over a year before Inter Miami is set to take the field for the first time, its road is not without obstacles. Battles in the courtroom and with powerful residents of South Florida have blocked its progress more than once. The team is working on its fifth potential stadium site, with no assurances that this one will be the last, and is facing multiple lawsuits seeking to block the club’s right to acquire the property.Even the most passionate followers of the team — who are united more around an idea than anything tangible — have been pulled in different directions. The cause of their split is the most basic of disputes: They disagreed over what their group should be called.The original fan group — known as the Southern Legion — was also the largest, with more than 400 dues-paying members. But last year it sought to rename itself The Siege.“We felt a change was appropriate once we saw the crest,” said Max Ramos, a founding member of the Southern Legion. “A group of herons is called a siege. It felt right.”Those who felt otherwise split off and kept the original name. Ramos insisted there were no hard feelings. The amicable split, he said, is a sign of the camaraderie that has helped fans remain steadfast in their dedication to Beckham’s grand, but at times excruciatingly fluid, plan.There is no turning back at this point, anyway. Last year, Beckham and his new group of well-financed, well-connected investors were finally granted the rights to an expansion place in the league. Satisfied that doubts about a stadium plan and the Beckham group’s resources and local commitment had been resolved, the commissioner confirmed that the team would enter M.L.S. in the 2020 season.The matter of where it will make that debut, however, is a bit more complicated.Inter Miami has been the focus of a stream of legal action in recent months, with issues including an ethics complaint related to the owners’ political lobbying, disputes about the feasibility of building a stadium on its preferred site and the legality of public votes on the matter.Thwarted at several downtown locations, the team now has its sights on creating Miami Freedom Park, a $1 billion complex spread over 160 acres at Melreese Country Club, a city-owned golf course near Miami International Airport. Critics have ridiculed the proposal as a real estate deal with a 25,000-seat soccer stadium included, but a larger problem may lurk underneath the golf course: Last July, it was revealed that it sits atop a toxic waste dump.“There are so many holes in their plans — it’s unreal,” said David Winker, a Florida-based lawyer who has filed two lawsuits against Beckham’s franchise in the past five months.Winker described himself as a soccer fan eager to take his family to matches when the team begins play — Florida International University could serve as a temporary home while the legal fights continue — but not, he said, at any cost.“I was immediately suspicious of how the deal was being conducted — behind closed-door negotiations and in a frantic rush,” Winker added, calling it “just a terrible way to introduce a new sports team to Miami.”Still, in November, it appeared that Beckham, his ownership group and M.L.S. had finally cleared the last hurdle. Amid songs, drumbeats and free paella on Election Day, Beckham and his new partners — including Jose and Jorge Mas, the Miami-based construction magnates; Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese owner of SoftBank; Marcelo Claure, the former chief executive of Sprint telecommunications; and the pop-music mogul Simon Fuller — celebrated victory in a public referendum that had granted them the right to enter into a noncompete bidding process for the Melreese property.Just 24 hours later, however, those negotiations were frozen because of an ethics complaint filed by Winker after he noticed that of all the people who spoke on behalf of the project before the city commission that will decide its fate, none had properly registered as a lobbyist. Those speakers included the aunt of the commission’s chairman, Keon Hardemon.Although the Miami-Dade County ethics commission issued a letter last month advising that the negotiations over a 99-year lease on the golf course site could move forward while an investigation continued, problems persist.Winker filed a lawsuit in which he argued that city documents provided an unclear land description, and that the city should be prohibited from using the referendum as authorization to negotiate a no-bid lease. Ordinarily, he said, that type of sale would be open to bids.A separate lawsuit by Bruce C. Matheson, a wealthy landowner in South Florida, also took aim at the referendum. Matheson had previously filed suit to block a stadium planned for the Overtown neighborhood of Miami, near where he owns property.“Each plan seems more convoluted than the last,” Matheson said this month.Victoria Mendez, the city’s lawyer, told The Miami Herald last month that the actions filed by Winker and Matheson did not “depict a clear understanding of our codes.” M.L.S. continues to express its support; in November, Garber hailed the victory in the stadium referendum as “a historic day for the sport in our country.”Inter Miami, meanwhile, is plowing ahead.“The baseless and frivolous lawsuits/complaints will not deter any of our efforts and focus,” Jorge Mas wrote in an email. “These are sideshows and a nonissue to our plan.”Beckham, who is based in London, has placed confidence in his local partners to navigate the political and legal waters of South Florida.The team’s fans appear to be doing the same.“Once we begin playing next year,” said Ramos, the Siege leader, “everything else will be forgotten.”"
"In Europe, a Bitter Battle Between Clubs and Leagues Is Taking Shape - The New York Times
LONDON — Confronted with what they consider a power play by a group of wealthy soccer clubs to promote the Champions League at the expense of national championships, representatives of Europe’s domestic leagues will meet in Lisbon this week to discuss a strategy to protect what they say is decades of tradition, and a basic sense of fairness.What the leagues fear, several officials said, is what they consider a behind-the-scenes campaign to reshape European soccer for the exclusive benefit of the continent’s biggest clubs. The leagues contend the proposed changes to the Champions League, which include new barriers to entry for nonelite clubs and schedule changes that would push matches onto weekend dates, will diminish the relevance and marketability of domestic leagues, and potentially render many of their matches irrelevant.At this week’s Lisbon meeting, an annual gathering of the umbrella European Leagues group, members will discuss plans to fight back — perhaps even in court — against suggested changes that they argue will adversely affect the competitions that still form the cultural and financial backbone of the global soccer industry. The coalition of leagues is a diverse group — leagues from Portugal to Ukraine are members — but a potentially formidable one given the influence and resources of members like England’s Premier League, Germany’s Bundesliga and Spain’s La Liga.“The association of European Leagues is raising its voice and the leagues are cohesive more than ever in the defense and protection of domestic football,” said Alberto Colombo, the deputy general secretary of the European league body, in an interview.While representatives of the continent’s richest and most powerful clubs and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, say any discussions for reforming club competitions like the Champions League remain in their infancy, league officials have grown increasingly concerned about details of the proposed changes that have started to leak.The most dramatic include reducing the size of national leagues and altering their schedules to allow European games to be played on weekends, a window historically reserved for domestic matches. The Bundesliga’s chief executive called weekend Champions League matches a “red line” that could not be crossed. English officials similarly declared the idea a nonstarter.“It is the role of the Premier League and other English football organizations to govern the format of league and cup competitions in this country,” the Premier League spokesman Nick Noble said. “It would be wholly inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structure of domestic English football.”Other proposals would see access to the Champions League itself severely restricted, with only 8 of 32 participants allowed to earn their places through success in domestic competition the previous season. The other 24 places would be reserved for teams already in the Champions League, or a handful of participants from a second-tier European club competition.Andrea Agnelli, the president of Juventus, who leads the powerful European Club Association, said at that group’s annual meeting in Amsterdam last week that it would be at least a year before any changes would be finalized, and he refused to discuss details of proposals already under discussion. However, in an interview with The Guardian last year, he described reforms he would like to see that appear to be similar to those currently under discussion.While the E.C.A. represents more than 200 clubs from across Europe, it is increasingly dominated by a handful of the largest teams. That group includes the likes of Juventus and Bayern Munich but also heavyweights from Spain and England like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Those clubs have for years used their might — and threats to break away and form an exclusive competition outside the current domestic league structure — to wrest concessions from soccer’s leaders.Javier Tebas, the frequently outspoken head of Spain’s top league, said the proposal to restructure continental competitions for the benefit of the small group of rich clubs that already dominate them would spell doom for soccer in large parts of Europe. The changes would, Tebas said, allow the wealthiest clubs to widen the massive talent and resource gap they already enjoy, and tear away the fabric of the sport’s traditions.Playing European competition matches on the weekend, in particular, would be “a recipe for the demise of football across Europe,” Tebas said in a statement. The Bundesliga’s chief executive, Christian Seifert, concurred in a speech earlier this year.“The weekend must belong to the national leagues,” Seifert said. “They are the heart and soul of professional football.”Access to the Champions League is currently linked to performance in domestic leagues, but under one set of proposals that could change drastically, with most participating teams allowed to compete year after year regardless of their league positions. In one plan, Europe’s top 32 teams would be divided into four groups of eight teams, with the top four each season advancing to a knockout round to determine the winner.Such a change would dramatically reduce the attractiveness of national leagues for broadcasters, where the battle to qualify for European club competitions has long been part of the narrative sold to television companies. At times, in fact, the battle for Champions League positions has often been more compelling than the race for the title, which in some countries is often wrapped up months before the end of the campaign.Agnelli hinted that, in the future, qualification could be based on success within European competitions — a setup that would maximize places for teams already in, and serve as a significant barrier to clubs trying to break in.“It is certainly something that is logical,” he said when asked if teams could be promoted or relegated within a closed European system. The proposals could transform soccer’s top club competition into one that resembles a similar event in European basketball, where 11 of the 16 teams in the EuroLeague are guaranteed spots regardless of their domestic performances.For the biggest clubs, a closed-off Champions League would offer financial certainty. But the leagues are vowing to defend a structure that currently allows any team the opportunity to win — on the field — a place among the giants.“The leagues defend the basic values of the European sport model, based on sporting merits, an open-access pyramid structure where all clubs form the foundation and all clubs could live the dream to reach the top,” said Colombo, of the European league body.While the top clubs have forged close links to UEFA thanks to a deepening friendship between Agnelli, the E.C.A. leader, and UEFA’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, the leagues — faced with a critical leadership void at a vital moment — have struggled to present a cohesive opposing voice. The Premier League, for example, remains without a leader after stumbling in its search for a replacement for its longtime chief executive Richard Scudamore, who retired last year. And Lars-Christer Olsson, the chairman of the European League body, has only recently recovered from a serious illness."
"FIFA Leaders Head to U.S., a Trip Once Fraught With Risk - The New York Times
Not so long ago the idea of merely setting foot in the United States would have filled FIFA’s leaders with dread. The idea of holding an important meeting there would have been rejected as absurd.That was because a sprawling corruption indictment by the United States Department of Justice in 2015 had threatened the very existence of FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. The investigation had produced the dawn arrests of more than a dozen top power brokers in the sport and eventually led to the ouster of some of the organization’s most powerful figures. It left others fearful of traveling to the United States for any reason, lest they risk being picked up by the authorities.Yet this week, almost four years later, FIFA is bringing the members of its governing council — a body that, in an earlier incarnation, was accused by the American authorities of engaging in graft schemes dating back decades — to United States soil for the first time since the scandal broke. The 37-member body, an expanded group now known as the FIFA Council, will hold a meeting in Miami on Friday to discuss, among other things, a significant expansion of the 2022 World Cup and a multibillion-dollar plan for a new World Cup-style competition for clubs.The site of the meeting, FIFA says, is the latest sign that it has moved on from its corrupt past.“It’s probably fair to say that there is a symbolic significance for the FIFA Council to meet in the U.S.A. for the first time since 2015,” FIFA, which is based in Zurich, said in a statement.Four years ago, images of police officers leading soccer officials out of a luxury Swiss hotel in two separate dawn raids gripped the sporting world, unleashing a crisis that has cost FIFA millions of dollars and led to years of turmoil. Dozens of soccer officials, businessmen and companies have since pleaded guilty to charges in United States courts; others are fighting extradition; and two men, including the former head of South American soccer, were jailed after a 2017 trial in New York. The crisis also led to the ouster of a number of executives not named in the indictments, including FIFA’s longtime president at the time, Joseph S. Blatter.While there is little sign another blockbuster raid is in the offing, United States authorities’ interest in FIFA has not dimmed. Multiple defendants who have pleaded guilty in the case have not yet been sentenced, with prosecutors again agreeing this year to push back decisions about the punishments of at least five people, including an Argentine businessman who testified at the New York trial and has served as a key cooperating witness.“FIFA remains ready to assist public authorities in all cases and, while the experience was difficult, we are finally very grateful that the U.S. Department of Justice intervened when it did to address some serious governance problems and, in so doing, help put FIFA on the path to reform,” its statement added.The current leadership has attempted to build bridges with the American authorities. FIFA’s top legal official, the deputy secretary general Alasdair Bell, made it a priority to visit Brooklyn and meet with prosecutors upon joining the soccer body in September. His visit came a month after FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, met with President Trump at the White House.Such trips were considered perilous four years ago. Blatter and his former No. 2, Jérôme Valcke, who faces a separate corruption investigation in Switzerland, skipped the Women’s World Cup when it was held in Canada in the summer of 2015, only weeks after the first raids in Switzerland. Other officials also have stayed safely out of reach.FIFA has not confirmed whether any council members will skip next week’s meeting, though at least one may not travel, according to a person familiar with the council member’s thinking.Coming to Miami also renews focus on Concacaf, the regional confederation that governs soccer in North and Central America and Caribbean. Based in the city, Concacaf is one of soccer’s six regional governing bodies, but it perhaps felt the most damage from the scandal: three of its former presidents were charged by United States authorities, and an internal probe later found multiple examples of rogue behavior, including self-dealing, indiscriminate use of private jets and even the recruitment of a private detective to snoop on individuals, including the former U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati, who still sits on the FIFA Council.Concacaf, which  nearly closed amid a banking crisis brought on by the Justice Department case, is largely prospering after introducing governance reforms. It has also changed headquarters, moving from a location in Miami Beach that was the target of F.B.I. raids in 2015 to a new office in the city’s business district.Its current president, Victor Montagliani of Canada, said Concacaf had “long turned the page” on its existential crisis.“Having FIFA come to Miami for the first time since the events of 2015 marks a momentum forward for world football,” he said, “and we are glad to play our part.”While its worst days may have passed, global soccer continues to be dogged by sporadic episodes of unethical behavior by senior figures. A Ghanaian member of the FIFA Council, Kwesi Nyantakyi, received a lifetime ban last year after being caught on camera accepting thousands of dollars in cash from an undercover reporter. And last week, another council member, Lee Harmon of the Cook Islands, received a three-month ban for the illegal resale of tickets to last year’s World Cup in Russia.To Miguel Maduro, a former governance head at FIFA, the continuing problems are both structural and cultural, part of a system that he said was still being run as a “political cartel.” Infantino, for example, will stand unopposed for re-election later this year in an election that will mirror the one for the presidency of European soccer in February. In that race, the incumbent, Aleksander Ceferin, was re-elected by acclamation.Perhaps the biggest sign of FIFA’s difficulties in changing the culture is its inability to wean the council members who will be in Miami off the kind of lifestyle even they have acknowledged to be excessive. At previous meetings, for example, members have described being met on the airport tarmac and whisked to luxury hotels without having to go through the usual arrival protocol. Even after FIFA’s reforms, they receive annual salaries of $250,000, plus an additional per diem, to attend as few as three meetings a year.“That’s one of the reasons you maintain the cartel,” Maduro said. “You have to satisfy the people that keep you in power.”"
"German Clubs and English Teenagers: The Jadon Sancho Effect - The New York Times
DORTMUND, Germany — At first glance, it is easy to pinpoint the start of the Bundesliga’s love affair with young English players. The opening scene of a story that has swept a host of England’s brightest prospects out of the Premier League’s overstuffed academies and into top-flight German soccer is set at a specific time — the first few days of October 2016 — and in a specific place: Pula, Croatia.That week, England’s under-17 team took part in the Croatian Cup, a youth invitational that also featured teams from Germany, Greece and the host nation. England won it, and in some style, rounding off the competition with an 8-1 rout of Germany.Even before that, though, the amount of talent on display had turned heads. Several scouts from Bundesliga clubs had been in attendance at Pula’s Aldo Drosina Stadium for England’s first game, a 5-0 win against Croatia.Though many of the English players involved would go on to win the under-17 World Cup a little more than a year later, one, in particular, stood out. A scout, present that day, remembers being taken aback by the player’s appetite. Even with England comfortably ahead, he said, he kept running, kept trying to score goals.The scout flagged the player, Jadon Sancho, to his superiors, but to no avail. Less than a year later, Sancho was on his way to Germany, but to sign with Borussia Dortmund, another of the clubs that had watched him that day. Within a few months, he was a regular on Dortmund’s first team, a senior England international and one of the most coveted players in Europe.He was also a trendsetter. After Sancho, a flood of young British players have landed in the Bundesliga: Arsenal’s Emile Smith Rowe — another veteran of that Croatian trip — and Reiss Nelson, on loan at RB Leipzig and TSG Hoffenheim; representatives at Augsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach and Schalke.In January, Bayern Munich was so determined to sign Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi — another who featured in Croatia — that it offered 40 million euros (about $45 million) for a teenager who had made only a handful of senior appearances. Sancho’s effect, the legacy of that day in Pula, has been powerful.It is a compelling story, but not necessarily an accurate one. Sancho has been presented as the trigger for German clubs’ fascination with young English talent, but, in reality, he was the end result: a consequence, rather than a cause, of a trend that dates way beyond 2016, one that explains why, exactly, all of those Bundesliga scouts were watching that under-17 game in Pula.“About 10 years ago, we decided that young players had to be our focus as a club,” said Max Eberl, Mönchengladbach’s sporting director. “We had no financial potential to do anything else. We had to create money and value a different way.”That meant keeping tabs on the best young talent not just in Germany, but across Europe. Mönchengladbach’s scouts started watching national youth teams, a shortcut to establishing which players were regarded as the best in their homelands, and a chance to compare them directly with the talent on the rise in Germany.The initial emphasis, Eberl explained, was on France, Belgium and Holland — traditionally fertile breeding grounds — as well as markets like Denmark, where his club had strong links. England “was not a market we had focused on,” he said, but it did not take long to realize that there were a “lot of top players” in England’s age-group teams.Eberl dispatched scouts not to watch the Premier League, but to games between clubs’ under-18 and under-23 teams. “At the time, English clubs bought players but did not care about their academies,” he said. “The players they were developing — 30 or 40 guys, really good, really well prepared — had no chance.”Around the same time, Dortmund came to the same realization. “Five or 10 years ago, we had the feeling that the education and development of youth players in England is quite good,” Michael Zorc, the club’s technical director, said. “The teams don’t only spend money on transfers and salaries, but on infrastructure. When you see these academies, you cannot compare the standard with Germany. It is much, much higher.”Most important, these state-of-the-art facilities were churning out players with the skill sets Bundesliga clubs needed. “England had so many creative players,” Nils Schmadtke, formerly the head scout at Cologne, said. “Kids like Sancho: good at penetrating the sidelines, not afraid in one against ones, good technique, fast.”Just as significant as discovering this steady supply of talent in England, though, was the increasing demand in Germany.Youth is the Bundesliga’s calling card. Germany’s top division prides itself on its clubs’ willingness to give players an opportunity — a report compiled in February found that it is the youngest of Europe’s major leagues — regardless of age or experience. It sees and sells itself, according to one recent mailing, as a “talent factory.”Increasingly, though, there are concerns that less and less of that talent is emerging locally, at a time when German soccer — both at the international level and within the Bundesliga — is in need of renewal.The generation that won the 2014 World Cup failed miserably in Russia last summer, a disappointment compounded by relegation from its group in the inaugural Nations League last year. Joachim Löw, the national team coach, has vowed to transform the side, informing several stalwarts — Mats Hummels, Thomas Müller and Jérôme Boateng — that they will no longer be considered for selection.For the first time in more than a decade, the Bundesliga will not be represented in the Champions League quarterfinals. Bayern Munich is already planning for a substantial overhaul of its squad at the end of the season.It is telling that Hudson-Odoi, a young English winger, is at the forefront of its thinking: Zorc admitted last month that at the under-17 and under-19 levels, England had “overtaken” Germany. Schmadtke said that he believed the “individual skills” he saw from young English players — as well as on scouting trips to France — stood out because they are now so rare in his homeland. For Bayern, as for the national team, the pipeline of German talent has dried up.Eberl, for one, believes that Germany has “made mistakes” in developing its young players. Clubs, he said, have fallen into the trap of trying to produce winning youth teams, rather than concentrating on individuals. Schmadtke feels German teenagers suffer because they are exposed too quickly to senior soccer, playing for so-called B teams in regional leagues, rather than in youth-specific competitions, as they do in England.Both are confident that it is a hiatus, rather than a full stop. “We will have players in the future, but it will take time,” Eberl said. In the meantime, German clubs will continue to flock to England, hoping to find yet more players to follow the path Sancho has plotted. It is a result not of a love affair, but of the simple economics of supply and demand."
"Deep Roots at Everton, and New Ones, Too - The New York Times
LIVERPOOL, England — Friday morning, and Goodison Park is quiet. There are no fans milling around the streets outside, spilling out of the Winslow pub, eagerly rushing to their seats. There is no noise, no color, no riot of blue and white. There are only a handful of cars in the parking lot. It is spitting with rain.A stadium is a home, but that is, in truth, only an occasional role. These are places that blossom only every other weekend, as Goodison will on Sunday when Liverpool arrives for the latest Merseyside Derby. For much of the rest of the time, though, a stadium is dormant, quiet: an empty, expectant shell.The day-to-day life of a club — the parts of it that are dedicated to the business of soccer, and the parts of it dedicated to the soccer business — happens elsewhere. For Everton, the former is at Finch Farm, its training facility on the eastern fringes of Liverpool. The latter is in the Liver Buildings, on the city’s sparkling waterfront, where Everton relocated its offices last year, a new home for all those departments whose job it is to sell shirts and tickets and sponsorship deals. To most fans, a club is a team, hopefully to win games. To all owners, a club is a business, hopefully to make money.A club is more than that, though; there is another side, one which does its work not on the field at Goodison Park or in the suite of offices in the city, but in the tight warren of terraced streets that surround the stadium, in schools across Liverpool, in some of the most underprivileged parts of Merseyside.Across the street from Goodison Park, a group of children are playing on the Cruyff Court — a small, artificial soccer field surrounded by a metal cage, built in conjunction with the Johan Cruyff Foundation — behind Everton’s community hub. Inside, teenagers mill and mingle with teachers and coaches in Everton polo shirts.Around the corner, in what was once a run-down working men’s club, a few dozen retirees are spending the morning cycling through their memories — of Everton, of the city — over tea and cake. Pat van den Hauwe, a tough-tackling defender who played for the team in the 1980s, is helping serve the coffee.On Goodison Road, the club has bought three houses and converted them into drop-in centers, safe spaces for anyone who feels they need a place to go. Their doors are always open. There is always someone to talk to. There is always food in the fridge.All clubs run outreach programs, of course, and employ staff members to work in the communities they call home. But few, if any, can match Everton’s for size and scope. The buildings that house Everton in the Community cost more than $10 million to develop; the program’s annual budget is around $4 million. It has 125 staff members and 145 volunteers. It works in more than 200 locations: schools, youth clubs, community centers.There is barely a part of life in Liverpool — and particularly in the L4 postal code that is home to both Goodison Park and Anfield, Liverpool’s stadium, and among the most deprived areas in Britain — that the club does not touch.It oversees more than 40 social programs, focused on issues as diffuse as mental health and serious organized crime; it reaches more than 20,000 people a year. Last year, Everton won a grant of 700,000 pounds, or about $925,000, to lead a government scheme on Merseyside to tackle gang culture. It has a presence in 150 schools. In September 2015, it became the first club to launch its own school.Everton has, for more than a decade, styled itself as Liverpool’s People’s Club, a term popularized by David Moyes, its former manager, to distinguish it from its near neighbor. Banners bearing the phrase flutter from Goodison Park; scarves embossed with the slogan can be bought from stands around the stadium on match day.“Our fans hold us up against that image,” Everton’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said. “They expect us to live up to it. It is not a corporate social responsibility program. It is long-term, strategic work. It is a huge component of what Everton is.” So substantial, in fact, that before she was promoted to running Everton last year, Barrett-Baxendale ran not the commercial section of the club, or its merchandising arm, but its community department.It is not just the scale of Everton’s work that marks it as different, though; it is the scope of it, too. Everton goes into areas other clubs — and other charities, even — might find “intimidating,” as Barrett-Baxendale put it. Sue Gregory, Everton in the Community’s director of youth engagement, recalls representatives of other teams marveling at the fact that Everton — in theory, just a soccer club — was prepared to work with convicted criminals, drug dealers, members of gangs. “You could see it as the club risking its brand,” she said.Barrett-Baxendale does not. “We work on these issues because these issues exist on the streets of Merseyside,” she said. It is a view supported throughout the club. At the start of the season, Everton’s players signed a pledge that they would do their part to help with community work. A copy of it hangs on a wall in the Community’s hub. There have been times that players have had to be reminded to leave after sessions there: Tom Davies, the midfielder, once insisted he was happy to stay for as long as possible at one session because he was busy “coloring in unicorns.”Gregory, her staff and her volunteers know how much all of that matters. They hear all of the stories: the teenagers forced to work selling drugs for gangs to settle their parents’ debts, or chased through the streets for punishment beatings; the boys sent hundreds of miles from home as part of the “county lines” phenomenon, in which city gangs seek to control the drug market in smaller towns; the children who stock up on food at the sessions because there is not enough to eat at home.Everton does not have a choice, in other words, but to confront those problems. Shying away from them would make all the work it does nothing but tokenism. “This is our community,” Gregory said, adding: “These are the issues our community faces. There is a culture of ‘let’s try.’”Wherever it can, it makes the most of the power of its crest: The white-on-blue depiction of Prince Rupert’s Tower, instantly recognizable, is part of the city’s civic scenery. It transcends tribal loyalty — many Liverpool fans are part of the Everton programs — and represents, instead, permanence.“People trust the badge,” said Richard Kenyon, Everton in the Community’s chief executive. “They respond to it in a really powerful way. They’re drawn to it.”Those who would normally eschew authority figures, those who would not respond to local government or a school principal, respond to that crest. Everton, they know, is not going anywhere.“We are a consistent presence,” Gregory said. “Kids might have a really good connection with a teacher in one year, but then they move on, and the kids lose that. We are always there, so that bond is not lost.”This, more than the team or the business, is what a club is, what a club can do. Not far from Goodison Park is one of Everton in the Community’s smallest projects: a little corner of scrap land that has been converted into an herb garden. The plot is little more than a postage stamp. When Everton started it, encouraging children from these streets to tend to it, some worried that it would be ruined, vandalized, maybe even in its first few days. That was months ago. It is still pristine."
"Atlanta United’s Darren Eales on Buying High, Selling Higher and Staying on Top - The New York Times
ATLANTA — Most teams that win championships enjoy a honeymoon. There are parades and victory laps and time to prepare for a title defense.Not so with Atlanta United, which won its first M.L.S. Cup on Dec. 8 and, because of Major League Soccer roster rules, had to spend the next day releasing some of the players who led it to the title. In fact, from almost the moment the final whistle blew in Atlanta United’s 2-0 victory over the Portland Timbers, the club president, Darren Eales, has had to grapple with a host of changes, including finding a new coach, selling one of his team’s best players and juggling the remaking of a star-studded roster.At times, the off-season has seemed comically short. Atlanta United reconvened as a team and opened its preseason training camp in mid-January, then flew to California before the Super Bowl to prepare for a preseason friendly against Club Tijuana. Last week, Atlanta United lost to Costa Rica’s Herediano, 3-1, in the first stage of the Concacaf Champions League (the teams meet again in Atlanta on Thursday night), and on Sunday it opens its M.L.S. season against D.C. United in Washington.All of this meant Eales had to get his off-season work done quickly, and he has not wasted any time. On Jan. 14, Atlanta United introduced Frank de Boer, the former manager of Ajax, Inter Milan and Crystal Palace, as the replacement for Atlanta’s former coach, Tata Martino, who took over Mexico’s national team. Then Eales signed Josef Martínez, the league’s most valuable player last season, to a five-year contract extension. Soon after, Pity Martínez, a 25-year-old Argentine midfielder, was signed; that move allowed Eales to sell Atlanta’s playmaker, Miguel Almirón, to England’s Newcastle United for a reported $23 million, smashing the M.L.S. transfer record.Two days before the Super Bowl, the hyperkinetic Eales sat down at his favorite Atlanta coffee shop — appropriately named Octane — to discuss the team’s dizzying off-season, its sale of Almirón and whether, in fact, other teams in M.L.S. can copy the Atlanta model.You knew you were going to have a lot of holes to fill in the off-season. What was the process?When we went out and built the club, our intention was to be clear with the fans from the very start. We were going to attract players who were young, or going toward the prime of their career, rather than a last contract or a last hurrah for a player from Europe. The idea here is, we’re part of this global network of soccer clubs. Miggy came to us, he had two fantastic years, won the M.L.S. Cup in the second season, had tremendous success on the pitch, and then he got a chance to fulfill his dream to go to the Premier League and play for a club there. So obviously, it was good for him, good for the league, because now the league can say, ‘We have a mechanism for you to showcase yourself, so come to M.L.S., play in a short window, and when the right moment comes, you can move to a top league in Europe.’ That was the dream we sold, and we had to at least prove the concept because otherwise it was going to be difficult for us to recruit other players if we didn’t do that.This business model is routine elsewhere, but it’s still new to M.L.S. Wasn’t it hard to see Almirón go?Miggy delivered everything we could have expected, and we won an M.L.S. Cup. On top of that, we didn’t spend dead money on a player at the end of his contract and get nothing in return. We actually got well in excess of what we had spent on the player in the first place. So it makes good business sense, good sporting sense, and that was always the vision.You signed Josef Martínez to a contract extension, then acquired Pity Martínez, before you sold Almirón. Was that sequencing deliberate?We’re really pleased that we did the whole succession plan in reverse. We got our player in [Martínez] before we moved the player on to Europe [Almirón]. Hypothetically, if we first sold a player for $30 million and went out to buy a player, everyone’s going to quote us $30 million. It’s the nature of the beast. So to secure our replacement in advance with a number we were comfortable with, it gave us a little more carte blanche.You also had to replace Tata Martino, whose reputation was instrumental in attracting young players to Atlanta for the first year.When we sat there after winning the Cup, we knew the coach was going. The reality is, it’s no different than Nick Saban, who has said how he loses his coordinators every year but he doesn’t mind because he knows the replacements come in and work hard because they have a chance to move on. We can embrace that as a club. When coaches want to come to Atlanta, they can see that as well. Frank de Boer coached at Ajax, at Inter and Crystal Palace. For me, I’m really excited because certain coaches fit players. With Ajax, he had great success. He went into situations [at Inter and Crystal Palace] that weren’t good fits. But he was the right fit for us.A lot has had to go right: Not just the success on the field, but an owner with deep pockets, a new stadium, enthusiastic fans. You have all of that.Everyone’s been asking when soccer is going to succeed in America, but if you watched the Cup final, with 73,000 passionate fans who were tailgating all afternoon, with an exciting style of play, it really has happened in America already. It’s great for me because yes, I wanted to make Atlanta United a real success story. But we’re also part of the bigger story, which is growing the game of soccer in America, being the pioneers to hopefully one day make it one of the top leagues in the world.Can other M.L.S. teams replicate what you’ve done?I’m not sure about replicating, but like every other business, you look at what other businesses are doing successfully and try to take those things that might work. I’m a fan of how L.A.F.C. came into the league. You saw the way they filled out their roster; there were similarities. I wouldn’t say they were copying us, but there were similarities. That’s a good thing. We were in a strange situation as pioneers trying to grow the league. There will be more teams looking, when they think of their out-of-pocket expenditures, money above the cap, not just the salaries — there’s much more awareness around investing more than we would have in a transfer fee for a younger player because we might have a chance to make a profit, or make our investment back. That’s going to open up an avenue for a few more clubs.With all this activity, did you get a chance to take any time off this winter?My aim is to get to March, the international break. I promised the wife and family I’ll take a week off, and football won’t be mentioned. I’m hoping to get to the end of March and then I’ll crash."
"A Juventus Striker Faced Racist Abuse. His Teammate and His Coach Said He Provoked It. - The New York Times
Only hours after the president of European soccer’s governing body urged referees on Tuesday to call a halt to games marred by racial abuse, the Juventus striker Moise Kean, who is black, was subjected to racist abuse by fans. He was then criticized by one of his own teammates, as well as his manager, who blamed him for provoking the taunts.The insults directed at Kean — and the reproach from his teammate and his coach — came only hours after Aleksander Ceferin, the president of UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, had told an equality conference in London that his organization would speak with referees and encourage them “not to be afraid to act” if they heard racist abuse from the crowd.Hours later, in a match in Italy’s Serie A at Cagliari, Kean, a 19-year-old Italian forward of Ivorian descent, and two other black teammates, the French midfielder Blaise Matuidi and the Brazilian defender Alex Sandro, were subjected to consistent racial abuse from Cagliari fans during Juventus’s 2-0 victory.When Kean, who is enjoying a breakout season with Juventus, scored his team’s second goal to seal the victory, he stood motionless, holding his arms out, in front of the Cagliari fans, prompting yet more abuse. Matuidi, his teammate, was incensed; the Juventus captain, Giorgio Chiellini, protested to the referee, Piero Giacomelli; and Cagliari’s captain, Luca Ceppitelli, asked his team’s fans to stop.After the game, however, the Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci suggested that Kean should shoulder an equal share of the blame because his celebration had antagonized those in Cagliari’s Curva — the end of the stadium where the team’s most ardent fans are housed — who were racially abusing him.“Kean knows that when he scores a goal, he has to focus on celebrating with his teammates,” Bonucci said. “He knows he could have done something differently.“There were racist jeers after the goal. Blaise heard it and was angry. I think the blame is 50-50. Moise should not have done that, and the Curva should not have reacted that way.”Though Massimiliano Allegri, Juventus’s coach, told reporters that nothing justified the behavior of the fans — describing those who had racially abused his players as “idiots” — he, too, suggested that Kean had “provoked” some of the vitriol.“He should not have celebrated in that manner,” said Allegri, a former Cagliari manager. “He is a young man and has to learn, but certain things from the crowd also should not be heard. You need great intelligence to deal with these situations and should not provoke people.“That, of course, does not mean the idiots in the crowd and the way they reacted should be justified.”Allegri insisted that he does not believe halting games is the solution to ending racist abuse, though, because, he said, “not everyone in the stadium” should be punished for the actions of a few.“I don’t think talking about it all the time helps,” he said.Kean posted his own response on his Instragam account: a photo of his silent, arms-out goal celebration and the words, “The best way to respond to racism.”The president of Cagliari, Tommaso Giulini, said Juventus players had told him that Kean was wrong to celebrate in front of the home fans, and he bemoaned all of the “moralizing” over the incident — claiming that there had been no racist abuse until Kean had provoked the fans.“Cagliari rejects the accusations of racism,” he said. “Nothing had happened until the goal. Do not exploit the thing.”A welter of high-profile players moved immediately to support Kean: Raheem Sterling, himself a victim of racist abuse this season, told Bonucci on Instagram that his comments were laughable; Paul Pogba, a former Juventus player, encouraged “good Italians” to “wake up, you can’t let a small racist group speak for you.”The abuse aimed at Kean was only the most recent in a litany of racist incidents in Italian soccer: In December, the Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was abused during a game against Inter Milan; last year, the striker Michy Batshuayi, then playing for Borussia Dortmund, claimed that he was racially abused during a game at Atalanta, in Bergamo. Matuidi has previously been abused at Cagliari and at Verona.Football Against Racism in Europe, an activist group, has described the problem in Italy as an “epidemic,” linking it to a rise in far-right politics and anti-immigration policies."
"FIFA Approves Plan for New Club World Cup, to Europe’s Dismay - The New York Times
MIAMI — Against the wishes of European soccer leaders, FIFA pushed through plans for a revamped World Cup of clubs featuring 24 teams at a meeting of its governing council on Friday. The decision ended a debate that had lasted a year, while at the same time raised doubts about the caliber of participants in a major new competition championed by FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino.The remaking of the competition from winter afterthought to potential summer moneymaker — a replacement for the Confederations Cup, an unpopular national-team competition usually held a year before the World Cup — has led to a major breakdown in relations between FIFA and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA. All the European members at the FIFA meeting voted against the plan for the new tournament on Friday.European club teams, whose participation will be critical to the success of the reimagined Club World Cup, reiterated their opposition to the event only minutes after FIFA made its announcement that it had been approved. The European Club Association, an umbrella body for the continent’s top teams, said its members would not participate in the event, even though FIFA’s plan includes slots for eight European teams.Infantino, though, described himself as “a happy president,” saying he was confident that after further talks, opposition to the event would subside and the world’s top teams would take part. He pointed out that the event — held every four years — could bring in billions of extra dollars to FIFA’s coffers, which currently benefit from more than $6 billion from each World Cup.“We hope all the greatest teams will participate,” Infantino said at a news conference. “The best teams should have this world platform.”The main opposition to the plans largely relates to adding more events to soccer’s already busy global calendar, with fears that even more games could burn out top players, or leave them susceptible to injuries. UEFA said any changes should wait until 2024, when a new comprehensive schedule for global soccer is set to be approved.The Club World Cup plan had led to an almost complete breakdown in the relationship between Infantino and Aleksander Ceferin, the UEFA president. The men had not held talks for a year since a meeting last year in Colombia during which Infantino first unveiled the proposal. They did, however, meet for an hour on Thursday morning, where Ceferin outlined UEFA’s continued opposition.In other news Friday, the FIFA Council agreed to push ahead with plans to expand the World Cup in Qatar to 48 teams, an undertaking fraught with complexity amid an ongoing diplomatic and economic standoff between Qatar and a group of its Gulf neighbors.A study conducted by FIFA recently found Qatar, a desert state smaller than Connecticut, could not host an event with 16 more teams on its own. Unless the blockade — led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — is lifted, only Oman and Kuwait could be considered viable partners in the region. But both countries would be required to spend significant amounts on the infrastructure required to meet FIFA standards.Greg Clarke, a FIFA vice president from England, told the meeting that FIFA must consider the human rights records of any additional host country, according to people present at the meeting. Qatar has been forced to adopt new workers regulations amid a backlash over its treatment of construction workers building the stadiums there. That scrutiny would likely shift to its neighbors, Clarke told the council members.“How can you not think of human rights wherever you go? It must be an issue,” said Evelina Christillin, a FIFA Council member from Italy.A delegation from Qatar, which was awarded the World Cup almost a decade ago, was also present in Miami. Hassan al-Thawadi, the executive responsible for 2022 World Cup preparations, said Qatar remained open-minded about expansion, provided it benefited Qatar as much as it did FIFA. He failed to answer when asked to provide one example of a benefit that his country could derive from an expanded tournament.“We are open to exploring the options,” al-Thawadi said, adding it would be a “big, big challenge” to host a 48-team event if the blockade, now in its second year, continued. FIFA must make a final decision at a meeting of its 211 members in Paris in June; qualifying for the tournament begins that month, and teams and federations would need to know how many places are available.Should the World Cup be enlarged, FIFA would need to play six matches per day to ensure the tournament can be completed within 28 days, a stipulation it agreed with European clubs after moving the tournament to November to avoid the searing Gulf summer. That would mean rest periods for some teams of as little as 48 hours, and a potential risk to athlete’ health, according to the largest players’ union, FIFPro“At international competitions like the World Cup, the minimum rest period between matches must be maintained at 72 hours,” FIFPro said in a statement."
"FIFA’s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It. - The New York Times
FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.Since proposing several major changes to the sport’s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA’s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments — an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams — that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.The listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA’s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption — and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA — would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.Each of the meetings on Infantino’s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer’s six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.Infantino’s problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views.Some of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA’s tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams.Ceferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA’s Champions League and add to the workload of players.“I cannot accept that some people who are blinded by the pursuit of profit are considering to sell the soul of football tournaments to nebulous private funds,” Ceferin said in a speech last May. “Money does not rule — and the European sports model must be respected. Football is not for sale. I will not let anyone sacrifice its structures on the altar of a highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism.”Infantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogotá, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank’s Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.European leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote.The vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami.At the last summit, in Morocco, Infantino expressed frustration to the officials who declined to take part in the vote for his plans, according to multiple people present at the meeting.“As part of this discussion, people are asked to give their feedback on a series of proposals and, as in any democratic consultation process, every member can express its opinion freely,” FIFA said in a statement. “The feedback received will be fed back to the Council together with the results of the other consultation platforms.”FIFA’s task force for the two tournaments will hold its next meeting on Feb. 21 in Rio de Janeiro. As tensions grow, however, there is a chance that European executives will not attend, according to a person familiar with the continental leaders’ plans.UEFA declined to comment. The organization has been seeking the support of European clubs and leagues to oppose Infantino’s proposals. At the last two meetings, Ceferin has arrived armed with signed letters of opposition from The European Club Association, a union of the continent’s top clubs, and a separate group representing the continent’s domestic leagues.The proposals to expand the Club World Cup and to create a new global Nations League similar to the recently created UEFA version largely have the backing of officials from South America, Africa and Asia — likely enough to win a vote should Infantino choose to take one at the Miami meeting. Any such move would exacerbate the growing rift with Europe, however, and potentially lead to a larger crisis if top clubs and leading nations from UEFA refuse to participate in the new FIFA-controlled tournaments."
"Jesse Marsch’s Study Abroad Program - The New York Times
LEIPZIG, Germany — Upon moving to Germany from the United States last summer, Jesse Marsch, his wife, Kim, and their three children made a pact of sorts regarding their new life abroad: When a situation that felt foreign made them want to turn inward, they would challenge themselves to do the opposite, to turn outward and embrace it, to accept and understand it.Such discomfort has been precisely the point for Marsch, the very reason he diverged from an ascendant coaching path in the United States last summer and sought out the unknown across the Atlantic Ocean.In July, Marsch left his job as coach of the New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer to accept a post as an assistant coach for RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga. While unquestionably a step up in competition, it was, in some respects, still an unconventional move, and Marsch said even some of his friends in soccer asked him if taking a job as an assistant might be a step backward.But what represents a step backward, and what is the convention, when you are navigating a mostly uncharted path? Because while opportunities for American players in Europe continue to expand, there is not yet much of a road map for what Marsch wants to be: an American coach who builds a long, successful career in one of the continent’s top leagues.And so he has chosen to seek out that challenge, to take chances and to face the unknown and the unfamiliar head on.“I’ve gotten more comfortable,” he said, “with being uncomfortable.”After decades of battling stereotypes and preconceived ideas about their abilities, American players have, slowly, found a level of acceptance in European soccer. One of the players Marsch brought into the Red Bulls’ first team, for example, was viewed even here as a solid addition when he joined RB Leipzig this month. That player, the 19-year-old Tyler Adams, and other American prospects now head to the continent in waves, and in general the professional pathways there have become well worn and widely available.A similar process has yet to unfold for American coaches, however. There are no set pathways, and there are few pioneers.Marsch regards one of them, Bob Bradley, as the “biggest mentor” in his career, and he has found Bradley’s experiences instructive. From 2014 to 2016, Bradley held head coaching jobs for clubs in Norway, France and England. Looking back, his stint abroad was as notable for the milestones he set for American coaches — he was the first American to coach a team in England’s Premier League — as it was for the relentless stream of misgivings from fans and pundits in whatever new locale he landed. (Bradley’s Premier League tenure lasted all of 11 games.)“The perception of Bob, I think, when he was here is that he probably wasn’t as knowledgeable because he’s from America, that his accent and the way he talked about football may have brought questions up within fan bases about how do Americans think about football, how do they talk about football, even use the word football,” Marsch said. “All those things are unfair, but they’re realities we have to deal with.”That is what Marsch knows he is up against now, and it is the reason he says he has tried to take a holistic approach to this new chapter of his life.Under RB Leipzig’s manager, Ralf Rangnick, Marsch has assumed what he described as a fluid, all-encompassing role. At the same time, he is responsible for a weekly set of tasks — running different elements of training, game analysis and opponent preparation — whose strict implementation he has found exhilarating in a way only a knowledge-hungry coach can.While RB Leipzig and New York’s Red Bulls are both technically part of the same corporate sports empire, his first months experiencing the nuances of German soccer culture — the structure, the specificity, the attention to detail — reiterated for him how much he still can learn.“It would have been easy for me to stay in New York,” Marsch said about his last job in Major League Soccer, where he spent three and a half seasons and compiled the most wins in franchise history. “But in the end, that wasn’t really what I was interested in.”Instead, Marsch, who had begun the process of obtaining his UEFA pro coaching license in 2017, accepted an offer to join the Leipzig coaching staff and left the Red Bulls in midseason. Rangnick, an experienced coach and former Red Bull sporting director, is in his second stint leading Leipzig but plans to coach only for this season. The club has previously announced that Hoffenheim’s Julian Nagelsmann, a rising star in German coaching, will take over this summer.“I know the league, the team and I speak the language,” Rangnick said when he returned to the bench. “That isn’t the case yet for Jesse Marsch, so that’s why he will be working as an assistant coach.” Still, the club noted specifically when it hired Marsch that he had signed a two-year contract, with the expectation that he would continue in the role once Nagelsmann arrives.Until then, Marsch has been stockpiling professional experiences like a backpacker collecting souvenirs. That mind-set was one reason he was not interested in pursuing the United States national team coaching job, which still sat vacant when he left for Europe. Marsch wants to hold the position one day, he said, but only after he has accumulated more experience.Now, he said, it better that the American soccer ecosystem put its collective support behind the coach who was chosen, Gregg Berhalter, and move away from the negativity that seemed to infest its culture in the past year.“If I were to be critical of the sport in our country in general, I think we have failed ourselves miserably because everyone is the smartest guy in the room and everyone is the biggest critic, inside the game and out,” he said. “And that will never be successful.”Marsch also said he hoped more of his coaching peers from the United States would pursue unfamiliar pathways and leaps of faith, like the one he is taking now, so that opportunities for American coaches in the top levels of the game might one day seem as plentiful as they have become for players.Adams is one such player, and Marsch said he was eager to throw new challenges at him, too. Adams made his debut for RB Leipzig in a friendly during Germany’s winter break, and was included in the first team for this weekend’s game against Dortmund, though he was an unused substitute in Leipzig’s 1-0 defeat.“When you see this kid up close every day, it’s almost like you’re watching a weed grow by the second,” Marsch said of Adams. “That’s how he is. You throw something difficult at him, and he eats it up and spits it out.”These days, Marsch takes German language lessons three times a week and uses the language in coaches meetings and with players on the field. While he has improved, he said, the process also has made look, at times, “like a fool.”But those minor indignities, he noted, could serve as positives within a team context.“I think it’s an important lesson in an leadership position to show that you’re willing to be vulnerable, you’re willing to make mistakes, and that’s how I’m going to get better,” he said. “I think that’s the same thing we want to portray to our players: ‘We all mistakes. You’re going to make mistakes. But let’s all learn from them. Let’s get better together.’”"
"Athletic Bilbao Is Flush With Cash and Facing Relegation - The New York Times
BILBAO, Spain — Europe’s midseason soccer transfer window is open this month. For teams battling relegation, and potential financial ruin, it brings a last, vital chance to strengthen a leaky defense or fortify a goal-shy forward line ahead of the second half of the season.Among those teams is Athletic Bilbao, which is in 17th place in La Liga, the 20-team Spanish league, and already on its second manager this season.Financially, Athletic, a century-old power on Spain’s northern coast, has little in common with the clubs that find themselves in a similarly grim position. The team is flush with cash, with about 200 million euros, or about $228 million, in reserves, and has access to another 90 million euros that — if deployed to lure talent from soccer’s global marketplace — would probably go a long way toward firing it up the league standings and out of danger. But unlike almost every other team in the market, Bilbao cannot spend those millions on just anyone.Athletic is a throwback. Tradition dictates that it can only field players who were born in the Basque Country — territory that includes seven provinces that stretch from northern Spain into France — or who moved to the region in their youth and learned to play soccer here.That purity has been a point of pride for the 121-year-old club. Athletic Bilbao has long celebrated that it has never been relegated from Spain’s top league, a feat it shares with only Barcelona and Real Madrid. But it is only one slot away from relegation position in La Liga, and its purity presents obvious difficulties when it comes to recruitment. Lately it has placed the team in a financial vise, transforming it into something of a unicorn in a sport in which nearly every other club is desperate for cash. Bilbao, with its flush coffers and narrowed options, has become soccer’s poor little loaded club.“We don’t really need the money,” Josu Urrutia, a stocky, 50-year-old former Bilbao midfielder, said in an interview last month, shortly before he ended a seven-year run as Athletic’s president.His replacement, Aitor Elizegi, though critical of some of Urrutia’s decisions, was quick to confirm that the team’s commitment to Basque-only players would not be changed.Athletic can in some ways blame its recent success for its current fate. In the last eight years, the team has played six seasons in the second-tier Europa League (reaching the final once) and one in the Champions League. In 2012 and again in 2015, it reached the final of the Spanish cup.The success of those largely homegrown squads quickly drew interest from bigger clubs, in Spain and abroad, and led to tough decisions for a conveyor belt of young, talented players. When the club’s management had any say, the answer to any inquiries to negotiate a multimillion-euro sale was a simple one: no.Athletic, at least under Urrutia, never negotiated, whatever the price. Players would leave only if their buyout clause — a fee that would trigger a sale — was met, and Athletic’s management hoped it never would be.Urrutia, sitting in an austere drawing room full of lacquered furniture on the ground floor of a mansion built in 1900 and bestowed to the club by one of the city’s historic trading families, described how the club lost defensive midfielder Javi Martínez to the German giant Bayern Munich a year into his presidency in 2011. This all happened after he tried to ignore Jupp Heynckes, then Bayern’s manager, who had coached Urrutia, a tough tackling midfielder during two spells at Athletic, and Bayern’s top two officials, Karl Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness.“Jupp says, ‘We consider Javi is a player for the future, and 40 seems a lot; we are ready to pay 22 or 23,” Urrutia recalled. “We said: Perfect. So we don’t have to worry ourselves about it.”In the end, Bayern paid the full 40 million euro buyout fee for Martínez, a sum that broke Germany’s transfer record.Since then, the team has lost other players in a similar fashion. Ander Herrera, another defensive midfielder, joined Manchester United in 2014. Defender Aymeric Laporte became Manchester City’s costliest acquisition when he joined for 65 million euros. Most recently, Chelsea made Kepa Arrizabalaga the most expensive goalkeeper in the world after paying his full 80 million euro release clause.All those deals, regardless of the fee, frustrated Urrutia. He wished all of Athletic’s players shared his values. Urrutia came through the club’s youth system and never wore another jersey in a two-decade career. The club, he said, tries to instill loyalty from the moment players enter the system.Athletic officials like to play the guilt card and remind players that the Basque-only policy was probably the reason they were able to have a professional career in the first place — that the club could have picked other, better athletes if it had the option of shopping on the global market.“It’s as though you’ve left the family business started by your granddad,” Urrutia said.Urrutia and others explain that if players who came before the current ones had decided to leave, the club might have been forced to change its mission. If that had happened, Basque players might not have gotten their chance. The players should live these values, they said.Money plays a role as well. Athletic now pays some of the highest salaries in Spain, far more than teams of an equivalent standard, Urrutia said. He said the average annual salary of a first-team player was four million euros.When faced with replacing a departing player, the club always gives first preference to products formed at its Lezama academy, a world-class facility six miles outside Bilbao, the largest city in the Basque region. In each of the last five seasons, at least two academy players have graduated to the first-team roster.“We give them opportunities to play for the first team even when they’re too young, because we need them,” Urrutia said.Some players, so committed to the club’s philosophy, like midfielder Iker Muniain, 26, who has had offers to leave, have shunned the opportunity to play elsewhere. Just before Christmas, Muniain, an attacker who has been with the club for more than a decade and scored Monday, signed a new contract and asked that it have no buyout clause. “I’m pleased to do it,” he said. “We’ve had cases in which colleagues have left and people have felt sad and touched. This is a way for me to demonstrate my loyalty to the club.”Occasionally, the team does have to turn to the transfer market. The options are limited to players born in the Basque region or those who trained here during their formative years. That allows sellers to take advantage of Athletic’s limitations.This season, the team agreed to pay Paris St.-Germain a fee that could eventually reach 24 million euros for defender Yuri Berchiche, a defender who joined the French team from Real Sociedad for about eight million euros less just a year earlier.“They know, and they try to squeeze us because they know that there are not so many possibilities for us,” Urrutia said. “We don’t have so many options in the transfer market.”Athletic can afford this because only four teams last season received more money from Spanish television rights, which, for now, is determined by how often a team’s matches are shown. But a new distribution model aimed at reducing inequalities between teams is narrowing that gap. In the past, the biggest teams could get as much as 12 times more than others. That ratio is down to about 3.5.Though the change is generally considered to be a positive one, it disproportionately affects Athletic because far smaller teams can now trawl the world for talent they could not afford before, boosting their squads, while Athletic remains committed to its local-only policy and other quirks that make it unique.Its headquarters bear little resemblance to those of most teams. No brash logos, no video screens showing loops of historic success, no shop hawking memorabilia. Like the club, it is a throwback.There are small if understated markers, like the modernist painting hanging on a wall inside a ground floor reception room. It depicts a great flood that has overwhelmed an entire city. The only visible structure is an arch resembling one from Athletic’s former stadium that was delicately moved to its training ground. It is a symbol, club officials say, that the team’s past will always be a part of its present and future, whether it risks relegation or fights for titles.“We know the challenge: It’s a solitary challenge,” Urrutia said. “This is a voyage full of difficulties. There could be a tsunami, but at the end, we really believe in the strength of our boat and want to keep going.”"
"Has the Premier League Transfer Bubble Burst? - The New York Times
MANCHESTER, England — At last, it seems, among all of the hundreds of millions of pounds that float around the Premier League, the penny has dropped.The January transfer window has come and gone, barely noticed. There has been no orgy of excess, no frantic scramble to spend as much money as possible, no broken transfer-spending records, no helicopter dashes, no late-night drama.For once — for the first time, perhaps — English soccer has been a model of restraint and of prudence. For once, it has looked not at price, but at worth. As one executive at a Premier League team told The Times of London, “People are asking crazy money for average players.”That, of course, should hardly have come as a shock. The clubs in the cash-soaked Premier League, with its lucrative broadcasting deals and its seemingly bottomless pit of wealth, had no sooner helped to create soccer’s superheated transfer market than they began to suffer from it.In England, managers and technical directors and chief executives whisper darkly of an “English tax,” claiming that their counterparts on Continental Europe routinely quote them higher prices than they would a team from Germany, Italy or Spain.In public, those working in sales or recruitment in Europe dismiss that allegation — two sporting directors told The Times in 2017 that they work “with one price in mind” for a player, regardless of origin or destination — but there can be little doubt that, at the very least, many see English teams as easy marks.In part, that is to their credit. According to one executive at a Bundesliga team, selling to a Premier League club is a much more straightforward business than offloading a player to Italy or Spain: The money is invariably paid upfront, one lump sum deposited into your account upon completion of the deal, rather than an installment plan contingent on a host of clauses. It is also rather more palatable to fans: Clubs in Germany, he said, have broadly welcomed English interest in their best players simply because the alternative is seeing them move, with dread predictability, to Bayern Munich.That is not, however, the limit of its appeal. The evidence is anecdotal but nonetheless compelling: Europe’s clubs see the Premier League as a cash cow, and its member clubs as rather deeper of pocket than they are of thought.There are, for example, executives who tell stories of hanging up the phone to a Continental team and then immediately doubling the asking price when an English club calls. There are sporting directors who recall scarcely being able to conceal their glee when a Premier League team asks to buy one of their players, or the celebrations when they complete a deal for a vastly inflated price.And there is the manager who was presented with a tall South American forward by his club’s owner a few years ago and told that it did not matter if the deal worked out, because even if he did not score goals, “an English team will come and buy him for more than we paid anyway.”There will be plenty, then, who will see the drip-feed of small-beer deals and loans-with-an-option-to-buy that have populated this January transfer window and believe that it is just an exception, something cyclical, that come summer, the Premier League will be showering its largess on Europe once more.It is worth noting, though, that year-on-year spending last summer was down, too: barely noticeable in the raw figures — £1.2 billion ($1.57 billion), as opposed to £1.4 billion in 2017 — but in the context of a global market that had been distorted beyond recognition by the fee Paris St.-Germain paid for Neymar, an eye-catching drop.As unlikely as it sounds, the possibility has to be considered that the Premier League has finally managed to shake its reflex reaction to spend its way out of any problem, to break free of its shopaholism, to overcome its addiction to the short-term high of a lavish transfer.It would be reductive to attribute that to one cause; it is the result, in all likelihood, of a confluence of factors. Few in soccer, for example, believe that the uncertainty that has infected most British industries because of Brexit has had much of an effect, but it is hard to believe the weakness of the pound against the euro has not given at least some clubs pause.Then there is the assumption in the Premier League that English soccer’s television boom might have plateaued, and that the next broadcast deal will not deliver the exponential rise in income to which the clubs have grown accustomed. That, too, may have persuaded clubs to become just a little more frugal.If certain clubs have chosen not to spend — Liverpool and Manchester City for fear of disrupting the delicate harmony they have established, Manchester United because a permanent manager and a technical director must be appointed first — others have been unable to do so.In the case of Tottenham, with a new stadium to consider, and Chelsea, subject to a FIFA investigation over rule breaches related to young players, those circumstances are bespoke; for others, the issue is much broader. The short-term cost-control measures established by the league’s clubs effectively link increases in a team’s wage bill to growth of its commercial revenue; that Arsenal, for example, has not increased the latter means it is not in a position to throw money at the former.None of that, though, explains why everyone has been so parsimonious, so uncharacteristically cautious. Yet the trend is widespread enough to suggest that there has been a more fundamental change, that English teams no longer suspect they are being taken for a ride, but know they are, and are determined to put a stop to it.England for many years stood as a last, defiant bulwark against the idea that recruitment should be overseen not by a club’s manager, but by a technical — or sporting — director. Such an appointment, it was thought, would only undermine the authority of the man tasked with picking the team; in a country that sanctified the memories of Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough, the manager’s position was inviolable.That is no longer the case. Of the elite, only Manchester United does not have a technical director, and it is in the process of finding one. Away from Old Trafford, most teams have moved to bring in an individual or a team of people to sift through data, to compile scouting reports, and to assist — to choose a euphemism — the manager with recruitment. The days of a coach being allowed to bring in players on a whim are over.It is not a perfect system, but it is designed to prevent a club’s having to resort to last-minute purchases, desperate rolls of the dice. It is structured to make clubs less wasteful, more efficient. Its corollary is that it attracts managers more accustomed to working with what they have, or what they are given, rather than demanding money be spent to solve problems that have proved beyond them.And this is its effect: a handful of unremarkable deals, players brought in to cover a particular need rather than to meet a vague desire, over the course of a month that does not warrant the comic, childlike pomp and ceremony England usually reserves for the transfer window. A dull January is not a cause for concern. It is not a sign of a lack of ambition, but the hallmark of a league that is getting that little bit smarter, that at last is thinking with its head, rather than its pocket."
"Manchester City Delivered a Lesson. Will Chelsea Learn This Time? - The New York Times
MANCHESTER, England — As he trudged, wordlessly, away from the field, away from the crowd, away from the burning humiliation, Maurizio Sarri looked like a man who knew. He is not the first in his position to have worn that look, to have made that walk, to sense that, sooner or later, Chelsea has a decision to make.In these circumstances, that ordinarily means only one thing. Historically, when Chelsea is presented with the choice of whether to fire a manager or not, it tends to act as if it has no choice at all.Roman Abramovich has fired managers early and fired them late. He has fired them after winning the Premier League title but not the Champions League; he has fired them after winning the Champions League but not the Premier League. He has fired them against the fans’ wishes, and he has fired them to their intense relief. He has fired them for less than being beaten, 6-0, by Manchester City, as Sarri’s Chelsea was on Sunday, and he has fired them for more.Abramovich has been through 13 permanent managers since he arrived in English soccer in 2003. By this stage of this season, Abramovich — or, more pertinently, those who run Chelsea at his behest — knows the signs. Not just the obvious ones: the back-to-back collapses away from home, first at Bournemouth and now in Manchester; the inexorable slide down the Premier League table, initially out of the title race and now, usurped by a resurgent Manchester United, out of the Champions League qualifying places.There are the subtle ones, too: Not once, but twice since the turn of the year Sarri has criticized his players publicly, questioning both their mentality and their motivation. After a 2-0 defeat to Arsenal last month, he took the unusual step of making his public comments through a translator, just in case he could not find quite the right phraseology as he laid bare his complaints about his squad.It is a risky strategy, one with the air of a final throw of the dice. It is telling, then, that there has been no visible uplift in performance since Sarri’s public intervention; if anything, things are getting worse. Chelsea has still not scored a Premier League goal away from home in 2019; Sarri’s team was, if anything, somewhat fortunate only to concede six on Sunday.That, too, does not bode well. When he arrived from Napoli — belatedly, after a long legal tussle between Chelsea and his predecessor, Antonio Conte, that is still not resolved — Sarri warned that his methods were sufficiently bespoke that the players might need some time to adapt to them. There would be, he admitted, teething troubles.Curiously, they were not immediate. Chelsea hit the ground running. Eden Hazard declared himself delighted to be playing — at last — for a manager who prioritized attacking soccer, who might let him have the “fun” he seeks.The problems came later, Sarri’s prediction coming good on a satellite delay and the season slowing to a halt as winter set in. It is as if Chelsea’s players have unlearned what Sarri taught them, as if they tried his way for a while and then decided, actually, no, this wasn’t right for them.This is familiar ground at Chelsea: the manager and the players drifting apart, the words no longer seeming to carry weight, the instructions and ideas not quite cutting through. The same thing happened to José Mourinho, in 2015, and then to Conte, last year. Everybody knows how the story ends; it is not with the players moving on.Sarri, judging by his demeanor at the final whistle Sunday, recognizes that. This is the sort of result, he will know, that brings with it immediate jeopardy, that provides compelling evidence to support his dismissal. There is, though, an equally convincing case to be made for precisely the opposite, an argument that might make Chelsea pause, even as it begins to prepare the severance check.It runs like this: Manchester City has what Chelsea has always craved — not just success, but sustained success, consistent success, an unwavering direction. More than that, it has a distinctive, immediately apparent style, an enviable character and identity, a devastating beauty.It is not that Chelsea has not been successful, of course: Abramovich has brought five Premier League titles to Stamford Bridge, one Champions League crown, and more F.A. Cups than anybody would want, too. Chelsea still outstrips City, the two great transformative clubs of modern English soccer, in terms of honors won.But Chelsea’s has been a boom-and-bust kind of success, bountiful years followed invariably by fallow ones — one that is the result not so much of a carefully crafted plan but of the harnessing of chaos. It has long seemed fragile, somehow.City’s is different. City has had a little chaos in its time too, of course — the firings of Mark Hughes and Roberto Mancini, the existence of Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli — and its prominence was hard-won, just a little slower than many might have expected given the riches injected into the club by its Emirati benefactors.But now, a little more than a decade since their arrival, the path is set. City may not win the Premier League title this year — this victory showed just how well Liverpool and Tottenham have done to keep pace with Pep Guardiola’s team for this long — but it will at least come close. It will be the favorite to lift the trophy again next year, and the year after that. It is hard to imagine City slipping to sixth in the near future.That is a consequence of the amount of money spent on the club, but it is also testament to the way that money has been spent: building a team that is capable of playing the sort of soccer Guardiola preaches, that rival players — and fans — look on with envy, that takes the breath away.That is what Abramovich has always wanted for Chelsea. It is why he pursued Guardiola for so long, why he appointed André Villas-Boas in 2011, supposedly cut from the same cloth, and why he brought in Sarri last summer.It is not just a latent aestheticism, it is also an economic argument. The sort of identity that City has brings results; not always, not every year, but over the long term. It helps lure new signings, and it pinpoints who, precisely, those players should be. It staves off the need to fire managers every year or so, to rip up the blueprint, to start again by scouring the transfer market for new players or asking old ones to learn new tricks. A defined identity staves off the turmoil of a poor run of form, of a disappointing season — the difference between a detour and a road to nowhere. It means there can be certainty where otherwise there may be doubt.The problem, of course, is that it takes time. Even Guardiola, as it turned out, needed a year to shape City into what he wanted it to be, and that was with a team that had been built with him in mind, long before he joined. It requires patience, and understanding. It cannot be conjured over a summer, or over a season. It does not materialize if you keep firing your manager.That, then, is the choice that Chelsea faces. Fire Sarri, and the boom-and-bust cycle will be prolonged. And perhaps that would be the right decision: Perhaps he is too inflexible to succeed in England; perhaps what he achieved at Napoli cannot be repeated; perhaps his tactics have been worked out by opponents, and he has nothing more up his sleeve.At some point, though, Chelsea will have to do the opposite. It will have to stick with someone, to accept that time is just as important as money, to go through a fallow year in the hope that bounty follows. It wants what City has. To get it, it must start to do what City does."
"For Christian Pulisic and Dortmund, Chelsea Transfer Was a Team Effort - The New York Times
MARBELLA, Spain — It was just after lunchtime on Tuesday, and Christian Pulisic was facing a rare free afternoon. There was a nap in his plans, for sure, and maybe dinner at a local restaurant afterward.Pulisic was in this southern Spanish town, bracketed by mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, for a weeklong training camp with his German club, Borussia Dortmund. The sun was shining. Waves skimmed across the beach. Any leisure time was to be cherished.“This is always fun,” he said about German soccer’s annual winter break, when most teams pack their bags and go in search of a week of warm-weather training abroad. “It’s a week to get away, get some sun, just to change things up a little bit.”It was also, he acknowledged with a laugh, most likely the last time for a while that he would enjoy this particular type of holiday rest.Last week, Pulisic announced that he would leave Dortmund — the only professional club he has known — at the end of the season to join Chelsea of the English Premier League. They have winter breaks in Germany; in England, they do not.It is one of the countless changes, some small and many big, that the 20-year-old Pulisic will encounter in his planned move to the supercharged world of English soccer. It is a situation he says he relishes, a personal milestone in a young career already full of them.“This was a big dream of mine,” Pulisic said of playing in England, “and I feel this was the right time to make this step.”Pulisic announced his move himself on social media with an open letter to Borussia Dortmund fans. In it, he declared, with a “heavy heart,” that he would move to London after finishing the remainder of the season in Germany. He referred to Dortmund as “(y)our world-famous club,” the parentheses at once reflecting the deep ties he formed with the team, which signed him at age 16 and is the only professional club he has known, and his looming exit.Pulisic, who was born in Hershey, Pa., said he took great care to get the wording of the letter right, working with a team staff member to make sure a German translation posted at the same time captured the message’s nuances — and made clear his deep gratitude to the club and its fans.“The five years I’ve been at Dortmund have been unbelievable, and I don’t want them to think that I took any of that for granted,” Pulisic said. “It’s not going to be easy for me to leave. I’ll miss it here.”In the United States, where every turn in Pulisic’s career can be viewed through the prism of what it means for the American national team, news of the transfer generated a splash befitting the country’s best player. The fee Chelsea paid for Pulisic, 64 million euros (about $73 million), was the highest ever paid for an American player, more than tripling the previous mark.Pulisic acknowledged the enormousness of the figure, and the expectations that come with it, but he brushed aside the notion that it might burden him.“In the soccer world, especially now with these numbers you have, who really knows who’s worth what?” Pulisic said. “It is what it is. They wanted me obviously enough to pay that much, but I’m just excited to go there and give my best.”As transfers go, the deal was a congenial one. Borussia Dortmund had approached Pulisic last summer about extending his contract, which had two years remaining. But Pulisic signaled that he was hoping to move on.Michael Zorc, the team’s technical director, was disappointed. But he also knew such a day would come: Pulisic had never been shy about his ambition to play in England.So Dortmund and Pulisic quickly set about moving forward with parallel goals: the club hoping to maximize the value of an attractive young asset still under its control, the player trying to make sure his dream move landed him in the right place.“There was a lot of trust in these talks,” said Zorc, who said multiple clubs expressed interest in Pulisic and that at least one other Premier League team was willing to pay Dortmund’s final asking price.His transfer will bring an end to three remarkable years at Dortmund. As a 17-year-old, he broke into the club’s first team and promptly became the youngest non-German to score a Bundesliga goal. But his rise slowed somewhat this season as injuries and the emergence of other young players diminished Pulisic’s playing time. Zorc said he suspected the transfer negotiations had distracted Pulisic this season — “maybe his mind was not so clear” — but hopes the resolution will have a positive effect on the field. Pulisic agrees.“I feel much, much clearer in my head now that all this is passed,” he said about making the deal public.Pulisic has five more months to contribute at Dortmund, which leads the Bundesliga with 42 points — 6 ahead of Bayern Munich — through 17 games. After that, he will continue his development at Chelsea, a club not particularly known for nurturing young players.Still, it was not lost on Pulisic — or his father, Mark, who worked closely with him to evaluate his transfer destination — that Chelsea’s roster situation, with several forwards potentially moving on this summer, could work in his favor.“Of course that was part of the equation: You look at what a team is going to look like over the next few years,” Mark Pulisic said. “Chelsea will be having some turnover due to the ages of players. But, at the end of the day, that doesn’t matter. When you’re at the highest level of your sport, there’s going to be new competition coming in constantly.”Mark Pulisic also said the recent narrative that his son’s acquisition by Chelsea had been completed without the knowledge of the club’s Italian coach, Maurizio Sarri — an impression fueled by a television interview in which Sarri implied he had been left in the dark about the move — was “far from the truth.”“We obviously met with Sarri for quite a long time,” Mark Pulisic said. “We had a chat with him. Christian got to meet with him for a bit, and it just felt good.”The resulting move will represent a return of sorts for Pulisic, who spent a year with his family in Tackley, England, when he was 7 years old.His memories from that year are few, but vivid: winning a few tournaments with the youth team he joined, going to professional games with his father, wearing his soccer uniform all day at school, playing on a concrete soccer court afterward for hours.And he noted one more, rather obvious, benefit to the move: “I’m excited to go be able to speak my first language on a day-to-day basis,” he said, laughing. “Something as simple as that, you don’t notice it, but it’s nice at times.”"
"A Champions League’s Changing of the Guard Leaves Behind Two Fixtures - The New York Times
BARCELONA, Spain — In the last eight days, an era has ended, a dynasty has been dismantled, an aristocracy has crumbled and a balance of power that held for a decade has shifted. Change has swept through the Champions League. European soccer’s landscape has been transformed. Not that it was easy to tell from Barcelona last night. Here, where the hosts thrashed Lyon, 5-1, on Wednesday, it all felt the same as ever.This has been a tumultuous week. The peak came right away: Real Madrid — the team that had held this competition in its thrall, seemingly incapable of not winning it, its opponents apparently dazzled by the mythology of those bright white jerseys — humbled, at home, by a young and vibrant and entirely dismissed Ajax.The next night, Paris St.-Germain fell, the prize its Qatari backers covet more than any other once again proving elusive, despite the cushion provided by a two-goal lead from the first leg and the insurance policy of a squad assembled at extravagant expense.There might, ordinarily, have been some solace in being eliminated by one of Europe’s true giants, Manchester United, but that would only have applied if it had been Manchester United’s first team. It was not. It was a patchwork, scratch sort of a side, cobbled together with what little material Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had at hand, and it was still enough.And then, on Tuesday night, that other great cornerstone of European soccer — Atlético Madrid’s defense, so miserly and obdurate — came unstuck. It was generally held to be inconceivable that a team as disciplined and well organized and gnarled as Diego Simeone’s could contrive to throw away a two-goal first-leg lead, but contrive to it did. “It was not a lack of character,” Simeone said in Turin. “Juventus was just better than us.” He has not built his reputation on such acquiescence to defeat.Wednesday brought one more: Bayern Munich beaten comfortably on home territory by Liverpool, its players and coach, Niko Kovac, admitting that they had deserved no more. For the first time in 13 years, there will be no German teams present on Friday when the draw for the quarterfinals is made. There will be four representatives from the Premier League, for the first time in 10.No wonder, then, there is a sense that the guard is changing, that this will prove to be the season that bridges two distinct ages. The time of this incarnation of Real Madrid has passed, most obviously, but perhaps that can be said of others among the clutch of superclubs who have, for the last decade, dominated the latter stages of this competition, too.Bayern is gearing up to rejuvenate its squad. Atlético will lose the player that has best encapsulated its recent history — the grizzled Uruguayan defender Diego Godín — this summer.As they stumble, the English rise: Manchester City’s destruction of Schalke cemented its place as the favorite to inherit Real Madrid’s crown; Liverpool reached the final last year, and is a more rounded, more durable side this time around. Tottenham beat Borussia Dortmund in both legs, displaying a maturity it has previously lacked. Manchester United, reborn under Solskjaer, has a sense of abandon and fun that makes it dangerous.The Premier League is, at last, benefiting not only from its vast financial advantage over the rest of Europe, but from its decision — belated, admittedly — to spend a rather greater proportion of that on managers, rather than players.That is one reading of the situation, anyway. It is not the only one. The Champions League is about teams, of course, and about dynasties and eras and power bases and all of that, but more than anything, it is about players. Indeed, if the dominance of Real Madrid taught us anything, it was that, currently at least, this is a competition defined by individuals more than by systems. And those individuals have not changed at all.On Tuesday, it was Cristiano Ronaldo, scoring yet another hat-trick to pull Juventus clear of Atlético, to send the Allianz Stadium into raptures, to deliver on the reputation that convinced the Italian champion to spend somewhere north of $100 million on a 33-year-old forward last summer.And on Wednesday — obviously — it was Lionel Messi, scoring twice, creating twice, and orchestrating Barcelona’s demolition of a courageous, fearless but utterly outgunned Lyon.For a while, the French visitor discomfited Barcelona; for a while, there was a gentle draft of change here, too, if not quite a full wind. Lyon defended valiantly, and counterattacked with zest, before Barcelona broke the deadlock — a Messi penalty, deftly, almost thoughtlessly, chipped past Anthony Lopes.For a few minutes in the second half, too, Lyon had hope: Lucas Tousart had made it 2-1; a single strike, a bounce of a ball, would have been enough to add Barcelona to the list of giants toppled this season. It did not last long. Messi soon snatched it away.His second goal — a delicate shot at the end of one of those mazy dribbles where the ball seems to fall completely, hopelessly under his spell — effectively killed the game, before his two assists, for Gerard Piqué and Ousmane Dembélé, helped a victory bleed into a rout.But that is not what stood out. What makes Messi so captivating is that it is not just the killer blows that count, but all of the jabs and the thrusts and the parries. It is watching him dance around and skip over and ghost away from tackles. It is the precision of his passing, his unerring ability to make the right choice. Messi rarely tries the spectacular, the unlikely: he does not abuse his status, his talent. He just makes sure he does everything, almost everything, right. His gift has always been his simplicity; that is not fading, not at all, not yet.Eras do end, and times do change. Identifying when is not an exact science, of course: they tend to drift into each other; there are rarely clean breaks. But perhaps it is fair to say that Real Madrid’s period of dominance is at an end, or that the age of the superclubs has been put on hiatus, or even that Spain’s pre-eminence in European competition (every Champions League title since 2014, and 7 of the last 10) is over.But it is equally possible that none of those eras existed in the first place, and that instead they were simply consequences of the age of Messi and of Ronaldo, their teams the beneficiaries of their greatness, their ability to decide games and define seasons. That has not changed. Their age is not over yet. Everything might look different. Messi and Ronaldo, though, are still the same."
"Qatar Cuts Through Tension and Defenders to Beat Saudi Arabia - The New York Times
ABU DHABI — The message to the D.J. was short and to the point: no Arabic music.That was the edict from the organizers of the Asian Cup match here on Thursday, an attempt to limit even the opportunity for a flash point in the first soccer match between Saudi Arabia and Qatar since the start of a bitter political feud nearly two years ago. The dispute, and the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, has so divided countries in the region that even the prematch music at the tournament is now viewed through that prism.At other matches at the Asian Cup, the most important soccer event on the sprawling continent, the soundtrack has included music from the participating countries. That was not the case Thursday at the Zayed Sports City Stadium, where the sound system blasted western dance music in an effort to avoid even the risk of inflaming tensions between rival supporters.In the case of Qatar, that support was limited to a Korean woman, a male student from China and band of Omanis who arrived during the second half after acquiring free tickets. Almost no Qatari fans have traveled to the tournament amid the blockade of the tiny emirate by a Saudi-led group of its neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates, that has made travel extremely difficult — and entry into the U.A.E. close to impossible.In the end, in front of a stadium that was mostly empty — despite Saudi officials’ handing out free tickets and bussing in fans — Qatar was a comfortable 2-0 winner. The game was largely tension-free until Qatar’s exuberant on-field celebrations led to a minor skirmish with a despondent Saudi striker, one of few players from his team who did not head straight to the dressing room after the referee blew the final whistle.Coaches from both teams had tried to play down the political cloud that had hung over Thursday’s game since the teams were drawn into the same first-round group months ago. After the game, they steered a similar course, brushing aside any questions related to matters out of their control, and instead focusing on the challenges awaiting them in the knockout rounds. Qatar, which won the group, will face Iraq; Saudi Arabia faces a more difficult game against Japan, a regional power.“It has nothing to do with football so I won’t give a response,” Juan Antonio Pizzi, Saudi Arabia’s Argentine coach said in response to a question about the off-field tension. Félix Sánchez, Qatar’s Spanish coach, conceded only that hearing his team’s national anthem roundly jeered by most of the fans was a “difficult moment” for his players, but he concluded the game was played in a positive spirit on the field.Controversy flared outside the lines, however. Local organizers were said to have reacted with fury after a commentator on the Qatar-owned network beIN Sports mentioned the blockade during the live broadcast of an earlier Iran-Iraq game. In response, the Saudi Sports Media Federation released a statement Thursday accusing beIN, which is broadcasting the tournament across the Middle East, of using its exclusive rights to push its political agenda.The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have been in lock step in their opposition to Qatar, and that divide was visible in the stands. Behind the goal where Almoez Ali, the tournament’s top scorer, delivered the first of his two goals for Qatar, three men stood for the entire match, holding aloft two flags, one a Saudi one and the other Emirati, fused together.Saudi efforts to boost crowd numbers included commandeering two desks at the entrance of the Bab al Qasr hotel, situated yards from the U.A.E.’s presidential palace. There, officials armed with fist-sized stacks of tickets, distributed them for free to fans — whether Saudi or not — with only one request: Support Saudi Arabia.The efforts largely fell flat. The attendance was declared at just over 16,000, though the actual number of fans appeared far lower. Qatar had almost none: a Qatar soccer federation spokesman said as many as 2,000 fans would have made the trip in normal times. In the end, Qatar had to make do with a small and curious collection of followers that included Janko Yang, a 23-year-old Chinese student who grew fond of Qatar’s soccer team after its under-23 squad visited his hometown, Changzhou, last year.At the other end of the stadium, Mary Lee, the Korean communications worker who has become relatively well-known around the team, had somehow snagged a seat in the media area. Sporting a silk dress she had made in the maroon and white colors of Qatar’s flag — a direct challenge to rules that forbid public support of Qatar in the U.A.E. — Lee, 45, vowed to stay at the tournament until her adopted country completes its run. (Asked to change clothing by security officials before she attended the tournament opener between the U.A.E. and Bahrain, Lee has been given dispensation to wear her elaborate outfit only at Qatar’s games.)The most voluble support, though, came from the group of Omanis who had raced across the city after watching their team clinch berth in the knockout rounds with a 3-1 victory over Turkmenistan. Beneficiaries of the free Saudi tickets, they cheered Qatar’s players as they celebrated their victory. Oman has historically enjoyed a friendly relationship with all its neighbors, and has adopted a neutral role in the Gulf dispute.“We are like one country, we are one people in the Gulf, and we are cheering for them because they haven’t got fans here,” said Abdullah Moqubuli, 30, before adding that he and his friends would have cheered for Saudi Arabia, too, had the Saudis managed to score a goal.Sánchez, Qatar’s coach, acknowledged their contribution after the match.“We appreciated it and we want to thank them because it’s important to us to have also some people with the team,” he said. Qatar’s captain, Hassan al-Haydos, had a similar message for Yang, the Chinese student.“I’d like to thank him, and tell him to come to the next game,” al-Haydos said."
"For U.S. Women’s Team, Higher Bonuses Raise the Stakes for Each Match - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — When the members of the United States women’s national team negotiated their current collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer in 2017, they secured what seemed to be a significant victory on match bonuses.In addition to seeing those bonuses increase as much as sixfold for winning certain games, the players no longer needed to win to collect the extra pay. For the first time, they would also earn bonuses even if they tied matches against top-tier opponents.The compromise — ceding some guaranteed compensation from salaries in exchange for higher performance bonuses — helped break a deadlock in negotiations amid a broader fight over pay equity and working conditions, a battle that recently moved to federal court. But the players also decided the arrangement was a calculated risk worth taking: Playing for one of the world’s best teams, they view every game as winnable. And with each victory set to be worth as much as $8,500 per player, the bonuses brought the potential for tens of thousands of dollars in extra income.Yet two years after striking their deal, the players are coping with the reality that winning isn’t always entirely within their control. Experiments with roster selections, starting lineups, tactical formations and even substitutions by Coach Jill Ellis — all within her purview and part of the normal evaluation period between major championships — have led to uneven performances and to frustration within a team that now has large payouts on the line every time it takes the field.During the two years since the new C.B.A. took effect, in fact, the team has missed out on roughly $1.7 million in performance bonuses — sometimes as much as $200,000 for a single match. For some players, that is as much as $74,250 each. The analysis of bonus pay is based on figures contained in the team’s C.B.A., which has not been released publicly.“We have a very bonus-heavy structure, purposefully — we win a lot of games and expect that we’ll win a lot of games,” forward Megan Rapinoe said. “That is part of the balance, understanding that we have a lot of money tied to wins and especially wins against top teams.”The payments, which for the first time are based on the quality of a given opponent, are worth a maximum of $8,500 per player for a win against the four top-ranked teams in the world, plus Canada, and up to $1,750 for a draw. Against a tier of opponents ranked Nos. 5 through 8, wins are worth $6,500 and draws $1,250. If the Americans beat a team in the lowest bonus tier, like Sunday’s 6-0 thrashing of Belgium, each player on the roster earns a bonus of $5,250.Lose, though, for any reason, and the players on U.S. Soccer contracts get no bonus at all.Asked about how experimentation may cost the team short-term results — and thus, bonuses — Ellis said her priority has been looking long term and leaving no stone unturned before the World Cup.“You want to win,” Ellis said, “but I’d rather get every box checked.”It is also worth noting that the team isn’t losing more than it has historically; from the end of 2017 to the start of 2019, the United States even went on a 28-game unbeaten streak. But with each result now carrying a higher price tag for each player, the unpredictability created by abrupt experiments by Ellis has been unsettling to some in the locker room.Ellis’s experiments have varied, including using three-back systems that featured a midfielder, Allie Long, as a center back, or others that pushed wing Mallory Pugh into a central midfield role for the first time against several of the world’s top teams. Once, Ellis asked Crystal Dunn to play three positions in a single match.When there was a reprieve from such tests during the team’s World Cup qualifying tournament last year — Ellis kept her approach simple as the United States bulldozed through the event — the players noticed.“You’ve seen a lot more consistency in the lineups and within the roster, so we’re seeing more consistency on the field and on the score sheets,” Alex Morgan said at the time.But once the Americans clinched their spot in France, the tinkering resumed, and it has continued, even as the World Cup nears.“Sometimes it’s O.K. to sacrifice results in terms of performance to get the best out of the team and figure out what that is,” Rapinoe said last week, “but we’re probably past that point — or we should be.”The players were aware of the potential downside of their new C.B.A. even before they ratified it two years ago: A month before the players approved the deal, which retroactively covered all results in early 2017, they had been trounced at a new tournament, the SheBelieves Cup, while struggling to adapt to a new tactical system.The team lost the SheBelieves Cup again this year when continued tinkering by Ellis resulted in draws against Japan and England. Because the tournament also offers a $5,000 bonus per player for a first-place finish — another carrot in the new C.B.A. — the team missed out on a total of nearly $400,000 in combined bonuses over a single two-week period.“The paycheck was a little light last month, that’s for sure,” Rapinoe joked last week. “Unfortunately.”Those paychecks, though, represent the optimistic stance the team took in its C.B.A. negotiations in 2017. With U.S. Soccer unwilling to increase guaranteed salaries, the team sought other ways to increase its compensation and maximize the upside of future success. Unlike their men’s counterparts, however, the women’s players do not have large club salaries to fall back on if they get injured, fall out of favor or — in a worst-case scenario — miss out on the biggest bonuses by failing to qualify for the World Cup.That made the women’s new C.B.A. a stark departure for a team that had prioritized the stability of guaranteed pay. But it also means that a single poor performance now stings far more than it used to, even if it helps Ellis collect valuable insight.Ultimately, though, the prize that matters most to the players is winning the World Cup. If they successfully defend their world title this summer, all the dropped results and experimenting will have been worth it.“If we just breeze through and beat every team, 2-0 or 3-0, we’re not going to learn anything,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn said. “It’s good to get players who don’t have a lot of experience playing time. It’s good to play different formations and see if it works, or not, against the top teams in the world.“I see a lot of value in the losses, the wins and the ties.”"
"Three Days in Paris With the Designer Combining Sportswear and Couture - The New York Times
On a Monday afternoon in mid-March, in the mezzanine office of her studio near the Ménilmontant neighborhood of Paris, the French designer Christelle Kocher pauses briefly to re-bedazzle her blue acrylic nails. She carefully pulls a diamanté out of a pile and, using tweezers, daubs it with glue and then applies it to her nail bed. “I have to touch them up, as a few have fallen off,” she says.Kocher, who founded her eponymous line, Koché, in 2015 — and who also currently serves as the artistic director of the Parisian Métiers d’Art feather and floral embroidery house, Lemarié — is known for her mastery of rich embellishment. At Lemarié, she collaborates with luxury houses such as Chanel, Dior and Valentino, festooning their haute couture garments with feathers. For Koché, she brings her hands-on crafty sensibility to streetwear-inspired ready-to-wear, finessing nylon sports jackets with lace inserts and encrusting catsuits with studs and Swarovski crystals. “I love the culture of couture, and I am fascinated to see how I can continue the story and make it more contemporary with a relaxed attitude,” she says. “To create a new vocabulary between these worlds.”[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]Her fall 2019 collection, presented in Paris last month, was perhaps her most apt mash-up yet — a pastiche of iconic sportswear fabrics and racy graphics mixed with evening wear in the form of bias cut gowns assembled from deconstructed soccer jerseys (representing 19 soccer teams all around the world) and bike shorts paired with a sequin-and-satin tuxedo jacket. Some of these looks heralded Kocher’s new collaboration with Nike, a partnership that reached full bloom at a sports-star-studded fashion show last week, at which Nike unveiled 14 national team soccer kits for their sponsored women’s teams, ahead of the Women’s World Cup in Paris this summer. Featured alongside the new team uniforms were 13 one-off looks — dresses, jerseys, track pants and bodysuits — that Kocher designed and spliced together from an assortment of Nike women’s soccer jerseys specifically for the occasion.An alignment with Nike seems like a natural fit for the designer, who was an avid athlete throughout her teenage years in Strasbourg. She played in the French Junior League for handball from a young age; now, she runs in the nearby Buttes-Chaumont Park almost every day. “Sports really helped me to develop my personality: I was a very shy kid, and it gave me this sense of team spirit,” Kocher says. “I liked the comfort of the clothes as well, and I think that has influenced me a lot.”Still, high fashion, not sportswear, has been the constant on her CV. After studying at Central Saint Martins, Kocher clocked up experience at Chloé, Dries Van Noten and Bottega Veneta — the latter while also juggling her role at Lemarié, where she has honed her skills in applied crafts. “The history is so interesting because it developed through women who obviously were always working on it from home,” Kocher says of the art form. Though there was a moment when she was tempted by a cleaner aesthetic, she has stayed her course. “I read a lot about the feminist art movement of the ’70s, the work of Louise Bourgeois and Sheila Hicks, and I realized they used craft as a medium for emancipation and empowerment,” she says.After the Nike World Cup show wrapped at Paris’s Palais Brongniart, Kocher describes how proud she was to have U.S. soccer star Brandi Chastain, the 10-year-old British skateboarder Sky Brown, the German boxing champion Zeina Nassar and the South African track-and-field gold medalist Caster Semenya modeling her garments. “We wanted to bring together different athletes of different nationalities, generations and disciplines, and this is very much the same message I have at my show: this diversity and inclusivity,” she says.The following day, we’re in the decorous salons of the Mona Bismarck American Center, an exhibition space in Paris, which Nike has taken over for the day. Here, guests are invited to follow Kocher’s lead and customize their own soccer jerseys using an array of hardware, fabrics and patches. The space hums with a sense of excitement — adults given leave to dabble in craft — and Kocher, decked out in a patchwork tuxedo suit with satin lapels from her fall 2019 collection, roams around the room offering up tips. Though she works on 12 collections a year (eight for Chanel and four for her own brand), it is here, when she’s fixated on the minutest details, that she seems most in her element."
"At Real Madrid, a Dynasty’s Fragility Is Laid Bare in 90 Humbling Minutes - The New York Times
Memory has a tendency to smooth over the edges, to conceal the blemishes, to dust over the pockmarks. Hindsight can be distorted, and history with it: Knowing how something ended creates the illusion it was always going to end that way, a narrative reverse-engineered from the bare facts, happenstance prettified to look like destiny.And so Real Madrid — the Real Madrid of Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric, of Zinedine Zidane and Florentino Pérez — will be immortalized as the team that was champion of Europe for more than a thousand days, the first team since 1990 to repeat as European champions, the first since 1976 to win the European Cup three times in a row, the winner of four of the last five editions of club soccer’s most prestigious tournament.It will be remembered as a team that built an empire and defined an era, a team that swept all before it right up until the point that a vibrant, fearless Ajax Amsterdam arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu and brought it all crashing down in one night, the Dutch team’s 4-1 victory in the last 16 on Tuesday sending Real Madrid out and shock waves around Europe.But though the score line — the extent of the rout as much as the identity of the team that administered it — was eye-catching, the fact that it felt like an impossibility is, to an extent, a trick of the memory.Real Madrid’s dominance of the Champions League has been more fragile than the trophy cabinet and history books make it look. Lifting the club’s 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th European Cups was not an inevitability, the manifest destiny of a club that thinks of itself as the king of Europe.The best example is the first: Real Madrid was a few seconds from losing that final, against Atlético Madrid in Lisbon; only a 93rd-minute equalizer from Sergio Ramos took the game to extra time, and gave Real Madrid a reprieve.But there are more, far more. In 2016, just a few months into Zidane’s tenure as coach, Real traveled to Wolfsburg for a quarterfinal. It seemed a favorable draw, as close to a gimme as the Champions League offers at that stage. Real Madrid was down, 2-0, within 25 minutes, and secured a place in the semifinals only in the 77th minute of the second leg, with Ronaldo striking a pose as he celebrated his hat trick. Real would win the tournament that year, beating Atlético again in the final in Milan, this time on penalty kicks.The next year, its progress to the final in Cardiff was stately, serene, but that final hurdle was anything but. Real eventually beat Juventus, 4-1, but if that implies an overwhelming superiority, it did not feel like that inside the Principality Stadium. Indeed, for a time, after Mario Mandzukic had drawn Juventus even in the first half, Real Madrid seemed to be swaying. Its players would later admit that they needed to regroup at halftime.And then last year, when Real almost conspired to throw away a three-goal lead against Juventus in their quarterfinal, edged past Bayern Munich in the semifinals thanks to a momentary lapse in concentration and ability from the stand-in goalkeeper Sven Ulreich, and then overcame Liverpool — and the even more hapless Loris Karius — in the final in Kiev.None of that, of course, is to suggest that Real has ridden its luck, or to lessen the significance or glory of its triumphs, or to claim that what happened against Ajax on Tuesday, as the Bernabéu bypassed the rage it usually reserves for defeats and fell straight into grief, was only a matter of time.Real Madrid deserves its place in history, and its most recent generation merits its reputation as a dynasty team, one perfectly calibrated in talent and temperament to excel on soccer’s most exalted stage. But that history does not need to be airbrushed, to have all trace of blemish surgically removed.It has been tempting, these last few years, to see all of Real Madrid’s close shaves, its flirtations with disaster, as proof of inherent greatness: a team that knows exactly what to do to win, that always finds something more when it is required, a group of players whose gifts can guide them out of any situation.That is true, too, though it is not the whole truth. What Wolfsburg and Juventus and Ulreich and the rest prove is that Real Madrid’s grip on the competition was not as viselike as it seemed. It was, at times, only the bounce of a ball away from being loosened entirely. What Ajax did on Tuesday Juventus might have achieved a year ago, but for one moment, one slip, one whistle.Those blemishes matter, not because they can be deployed as false harbingers of what was to come against Ajax, or because they serve to diminish Real Madrid’s status, but because they act as proof that all those trophies were achieved not because of destiny but because of the players, and coaches, involved.Real Madrid does not have a divine right to win the Champions League. It was not carried to Lisbon and Milan and Cardiff and Kiev, and to constant glory, by its reputation or its aura or its history. It was carried by Ronaldo, his significance only highlighted by his absence, and his own refusal to countenance defeat, his desperate quest for greatness; and by Zidane; and before him by Carlo Ancelotti, and his subtle, shrewd, unspoken ability to elicit the best from the best.Real Madrid could easily not have won four of the last five Champions Leagues. At times, it has been hard to explain — particularly in an age when soccer is enthralled by complexity, by philosophies and systems — quite how it has done so. Perhaps that is why it has been so easy to revert to thoughts of a special bond between this club and this competition, to start to believe in destiny. How easily it might all have come apart was illustrated perfectly on Tuesday, how fragile even the supreme can be. That it did not, for so long, is what this team will be remembered for; the picture will not be complete, though, without the pockmarks, the blemishes, the edges, ragged and rough."
"Ronaldo and Juventus Will Avoid U.S. Amid Rape Investigation - The New York Times
Organizers of a high-profile summer tournament for world soccer’s biggest club teams have decided to keep Juventus and its star Cristiano Ronaldo away from the United States this year, eliminating the risk of the Portuguese star’s being detained by the authorities as part of a rape investigation in Las Vegas.While the bulk of the games in the tournament, the International Champions Cup, will take place in the United States as usual, Juventus’s games will be a part of the Asian version of the annual event. Juventus will be joined there — most likely in China and Singapore — by the Premier League teams Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.Ronaldo, a five-time world player of the year, is in his first season in Italy’s top league after Juventus paid more than $114 million to acquire him from Real Madrid last July. Only months after his transfer, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had reopened an investigation into accusations by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, who said Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 and later paid her $375,000 for her silence.Ronaldo and his lawyers repeatedly denied the rape accusation when it emerged in September; Ronaldo labeled it “fake news” in a video posted on one of his social media accounts, and at one point his lawyers threatened to sue the German newsmagazine that was the first to publish Mayorga’s accusations. Juventus stood behind its star, too, expressing appreciation for his “great professionalism and dedication” and saying Mayorga’s accusations “do not change this opinion.”Juventus has a multiyear agreement to play in the International Champions Cup, which is organized by New York-based Relevent Sports. Ronaldo’s legal troubles played a role in shaping plans for Juventus’s participation, according to people familiar with this summer’s schedule, which will be released next week.A spokesman for Juventus, which is on course to win an eighth straight Italian league championship, said “going east” to Asia was normal after spending recent preseasons in the United States.While preseason tours are not seen as serious competition, they are vital for teams’ preparations ahead of the new season, and Juventus would have drawn unwanted scrutiny had it traveled to America without Ronaldo, its star attraction.The case against Ronaldo resurfaced after the German magazine Der Spiegel said it had obtained confidential documents related to the case, and the purported payment by Ronaldo to settle it, from the whistle-blower platform Football Leaks. Around the same time, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had reopened its investigation into the rape accusation, following up on information it said had been provided by the victim.Ronaldo, now 33, was a star at England’s Manchester United when he met Mayorga, now 35, at a Las Vegas nightclub in 2009, just before his record-breaking transfer to Real Madrid. He invited her and others to his suite in the early hours of June 13, 2009, she said, where she says he sexually assaulted her.A number of the documents Mayorga’s lawyers say support her claim were published by Der Spiegel, which also published a lengthy interview with Mayorga. Ronaldo’s lawyers have questioned the authenticity of some of the documents published by Der Spiegel, but have not denied that Ronaldo and Mayorga had a sexual encounter, which they contend was consensual.According to her lawsuit, Mayorga reported an assault to the police later that day and underwent a medical examination, during which evidence was collected in what is sometimes known as a rape kit. The Las Vegas police have acknowledged that Mayorga filed a report and was examined, but the police said she did not name her attacker at the time. The case was reopened at Mayorga’s request in September."
"Emiliano Sala’s Body Is Recovered From English Channel - The New York Times
The body of the Argentine soccer striker Emiliano Sala was recovered from the plane that crashed into the English Channel last month, the British authorities said late Thursday.The body, recovered a day earlier from the channel, was identified by the coroner for the County of Dorset, England, the police said in a statement. The police said that the families of Mr. Sala and the pilot, David Ibbotson, had been informed.“Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time,” the police said. Mr. Ibbotson was the only other person who was on the small plane.The recovery crews from the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch tried to retrieve the wreckage itself, but bad weather forced them to give up, investigators said in an earlier statement. Privately funded search teams had also joined the search for Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson.Mr. Sala, 28, who had recently transferred to the English Premier League club Cardiff City from Nantes in the French league, was flying to Cardiff from Nantes on Jan. 21 when the single-engine, propeller-driven Piper Malibu vanished.Mr. Sala had sent an audio message from the plane to a group of friends on WhatsApp, saying that he was “so afraid” and that the plane “seems like it’s falling to pieces.”The authorities called off a search on Jan. 24. But efforts resumed after more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000, was raised from donors, including some of soccer’s most prominent players.On Sunday, a shipwreck hunter, David Mearns, announced that his team on the ship FPV Morven had found the plane. Another ship, the Geo Ocean III, used a remotely operated vehicle to film the wreckage, and images of the registration number on the fuselage confirmed that it was the missing plane.Mr. Sala had been one of the leading strikers in France this season. Cardiff City, which has one of the Premier League’s lowest goal totals, had signed him in an effort to improve its poor offensive production.The Welsh team agreed to pay 15 million pounds, or more than $19 million, to acquire Mr. Sala. Nantes has demanded payment of the first installment of that transfer fee, which is to be paid over three years, the BBC reported on Wednesday."
"Tottenham, Pochettino and the Cost of Everyday Excellence - The New York Times
LONDON — At the start of February, Lionel Messi broke another record. When Messi converted a penalty against Valencia, a few minutes before halftime, it was his 20th Liga goal of the season. He had reached that mark every year for the last 11 years. No player had done that before.It is a fairly common occurrence, of course, Messi breaking a record. He broke two others in December: reaching the most wins for Barcelona, overtaking Xavi Hernández, and becoming the first player to score 10 Liga goals in 13 consecutive seasons. November, by contrast, was quiet: He only broke one, for Champions League goals scored for a single club.Sometimes, he etches his name on significant milestones — highest scorer in Spanish history; most goals in a calendar year — and sometimes his feats seem more like statistical quirks, curious pieces of trivia: no player has scored two goals in more La Liga games than Messi, for example. All of the records, though, serve as testament to his greatness. Each one offers further proof of the consistency of his brilliance.And yet the more records he breaks, the more remarkable his career becomes, the less impact each new mark has. Messi’s scaling heights previously thought unimaginable, surpassing marks once deemed indelible, is now so frequent as to be mundane. Messi rewriting the history books is the natural order of things. His excellence has been normalized.What he has done, in effect, is a sort of impish, Argentine equivalent to what, in politics, is known as shifting the Overton Window; in public discourse, it refers to the gradual process of taking concepts previously considered unthinkable and making them first seem feasible and then, finally, ordinary.The Messi effect works on the same lines. Before he and Cristiano Ronaldo made a habit of scoring unfathomable numbers of goals, it was assumed that such tallies were impossible. The more they have done it, the more they have made it seem attainable. The more attainable it seems, the less special it looks.If the worst consequence of the phenomenon, for Messi, is that his splendor is occasionally a little underappreciated — something that is more of a loss for those watching than it is for him — for others, suffering the same genius fatigue, the consequences can be more severe.This week, Tottenham faces Burnley, Chelsea and Arsenal in the Premier League. It must, most likely, win all three games to keep within touching distance of Manchester City and Liverpool in England’s rocket-fueled title race.So fine are the margins that even a single slip may prove fatal, and once again condemn Spurs Manager Mauricio Pochettino and his team to accusations that they lack the cutting edge, the carat mass, to shine among the elite. Pochettino, like Messi, will suffer because of the standards he has set.It is worth considering, though, the nature of Tottenham when Pochettino took over in 2014: that Tottenham was a team deep in the shadow of its two fiercest rivals, Arsenal and Chelsea; one that only occasionally featured in the Champions League; one that few, even among its most ardent fans, considered genuine contenders for the Premier League title.Over the course of Pochettino’s almost five seasons at the club, all of that has been transformed. Tottenham is now, certainly, a better team than either Arsenal or Chelsea. It has become a fixture in the Champions League, with a place in this season’s quarterfinals well within its grasp.Since Pochettino took charge, only one team — Manchester City — has won more points in the Premier League. Twice, Tottenham has mounted sustained challenges for a first English championship since 1961. This season, it has managed to cling to the coattails of City and Liverpool, both of whom have more points at this stage of the season than all but a handful of teams in history.Given those circumstances, the season Pochettino has overseen thus far may rank as his finest yet. When the transfer window closed on Jan. 31, Tottenham became the first team in Premier League history not to add a single player over the course of an entire campaign.If that parsimony was extreme, it was not out of character: Since Pochettino arrived in May 2014, Tottenham has spent barely half of the amount lavished on Manchester City and Manchester United’s squads. The sale of midfielder Mousa Dembélé in January meant that, since Pochettino arrived, the club has invested less than $30 million, net, in the transfer market.On several occasions in recent months, that has seemed set to curtail the club’s ambitions. Pochettino has had to navigate several weeks without Harry Kane and Dele Alli, the lodestars of his attack, because of injury. In January, he lost Son Heung-min, the captain of South Korea’s national team, to the Asian Cup, too.The club continues, unhappily, to play its home games at Wembley, after a series of delays on the completion of its new stadium, now likely to be available in April at the very earliest, though even Pochettino seems to suspect even that target is ambitious. He suggested earlier this month that it would be “tough” to play there before the start of next season.That Tottenham is still there, then, its breath on the necks of Manchester City and Liverpool yet again, is a remarkable feat. And yet, just as with Messi, it does not always feel as though it is celebrated as such.Pochettino, like Messi, has changed the parameters of a conversation. He has made the extraordinary ordinary. It was previously unthinkable that Spurs might be title contenders. Now, it is not just accepted but almost expected. Indeed, the question more often posed to Pochettino is whether his team is falling short because it does not yet have a trophy to show for its progress.There is some validity to that question. As the Sky Sports commentator Jamie Carragher pointed out earlier this season, when this Tottenham team comes to be remembered, fans will not take into account where it played its home games or how much was spent to reinforce it; they will simply ask what it won. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that its relevance is overplayed.Soccer, like all sports, is about the creation of collective memories. That is why England continues to hold its twin cup competitions in such high esteem, though winning them is often not enough to save a coach’s job or build a player’s reputation or slake a fan’s thirst for success. It is why Pochettino’s bullish disregard for them — in words, if not always in actions — strikes such a discordant note among many commentators.But soccer is also about pride, and status. What Pochettino has done is restore both to Tottenham. That is not some meaningless intangible: It has concrete consequences, both in the stadium the club is building, a monument to its new reality, and the players it will, at some point, be able to attract there.Pochettino has not won anything, but he has created a club that expects — and is expected — to do so in the future. He has fundamentally altered the fabric of the place that he found. He has made what was once unthinkable entirely feasible, and he has done it so often that his brilliance has become mundane. It is easy to be fooled into thinking this is normal. It is not, and the best measure of how extraordinary it is may well be how ordinary it seems."
"P.S.G. Outclasses United, at Last Blending Grit With Its Goals - The New York Times
MANCHESTER, England — That sinking feeling, that sense that it was all happening again to Paris St.-Germain, might have set in a couple of weeks ago, when Neymar limped off a field in Strasbourg, his face crumpled with tears, the fifth metatarsal in his right foot broken.Or it might not have come until a little later, until last weekend, until the point when Edinson Cavani, wincing from the pain in his hip, was told he would not be able to return to the field at the Parc des Princes for the second half of a Ligue 1 game against Bordeaux.Or maybe it was not the injuries, but the composite effect of them: Maybe it was the slow drift in P.S.G.’s performances these last few weeks — their first domestic defeat of the season, at Lyon; being taken to extra time in a cup game by Villefranche, a third-division team; squeezing past Bordeaux, once Cavani had gone.It all pointed in the same direction: that just as the mercury was rising and thoughts were turning once again to the Champions League, the most ambitious club project in Europe, the team that has distorted the transfer market and — allegedly — bent the rules in its relentless pursuit of success in this competition, was splintering and fracturing and crumbling once again.Suddenly, it felt as if a meeting in the last 16 with Manchester United was rather more daunting than it had seemed when the draw was made, back in December, back before Neymar’s tears, back before Cavani’s grimace, back before Villefranche.That was partly because of P.S.G.’s travails, of course, but partly because United looked reinvigorated. More than that, in fact: United looked like a completely different team, with completely different players, the gray clouds of José Mourinho’s moody, miserable tenure replaced by the unending sunlight of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.Solskjaer had not lost a game as United manager before Tuesday’s visit from P.S.G. He had restored Paul Pogba — a virus, in Mourinho’s estimation — to his position as one of the world’s finest midfielders. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford were thriving, too.Old Trafford had its smile back, a predator’s grin, ready to become the latest place where P.S.G.’s finest-laid plans fell to pieces, just as they had at the Bernabeu last year, and at the Etihad and the Nou Camp in the years before that.Old glory would, once again, trump new money; an elimination from a knockout soccer contest would once again become a morality play about the dangers of consumerism, the perils of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing.And then, just when it was happening again, it did not. P.S.G. produced a performance not just of class but of cunning and courage, and swatted Manchester United aside, 2-0.Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappé — this great international vision, this expression of Qatari soft power, delivered by two boys from Paris’s sprawling banlieues — scored a goal each, and P.S.G. might feel slightly disappointed not to have left with more. Later on, Pogba — against his hometown club — was sent off, meaning United’s standout performer will miss the return leg next month. With his exit, all reasonable hope of a turnaround in Paris departed, too.As it turned out, the harbinger of what was to come here was not Neymar’s injury, or Cavani’s, or any of the other feints and misdirections offered by P.S.G. in recent weeks. Instead, it was in November, in the aftermath of the French champion’s victory against Liverpool in the opening stage of this competition.It was then, as his players danced on the field, celebrating a victory in a group-stage game — one high on tension and fraught with traps, admittedly, but still a group-stage game — that Thomas Tuchel, P.S.G.’s German coach, saw something.His team had not just beaten Liverpool for talent, not relied on Neymar’s virtuosity or Mbappé’s breathtaking speed; it had beaten them for effort, too. It had dug in and ground it out. It had proved, against a dogged, determined opponent, that it could fight, too. “Now, we feel something,” Tuchel said.Those were the characteristics P.S.G. fell back upon Tuesday night in Manchester: Thiago Silva, among the club’s first wave of superstar signings, all the way back in 2012, towering in defense; Marquinhos, deployed to stifle and to shadow Pogba, dominant in midfield; the bustle of Marco Verratti, the hustle of Ángel Di María.Those are the traits that teams need to overcome these challenges, to shine on these stages, to thrive in this competition, just as much as they need star power and sublime skill. Those are the traits that, in previous years, P.S.G. has not been able to call on. It cowered against Real Madrid last season, as if waiting meekly for its fate. It melted away against Barcelona the year before that, unable or unwilling to resist as Neymar and Lionel Messi ran riot.It would be dangerous to suggest that this victory provided a blueprint for P.S.G.’s future, to use this exception to prove some wayward rule. This is not proof that P.S.G. is better without the world’s most expensive player, or evidence that a project built on and seduced by star power is innately flawed.Neymar improves every team he is part of; if Tuchel harbors designs to win the Champions League, he will need the Brazilian back. Much the same goes for Cavani, as diligent and spirited a forward as might be found. Better teams than Manchester United, of which there are several, would pose more questions, and find more answers.That Tuchel found a way to win in their absence, though, suggests that something has shifted, that the P.S.G. project has reached another stage, that after years of searching for a way to win even when all seems arrayed against them, they have found what Tuchel, that night in November, called a “new culture.” Now, they feel something. All that remains is to make sure that Neymar, and Cavani, feel it, too."
"Three Tap-Ins and Manchester City Is Back to Its Old Self - The New York Times
MANCHESTER, England — The movement is so slick that it seems almost automatic, a machine whirring to life. In the best possible way, Manchester City’s players become thoughtless, operating on muscle memory. They do not need to pause, to think: They know.Fernandinho has the ball, midway inside Arsenal’s half. To his left, Raheem Sterling makes a run, darting outside Stephan Lichtsteiner. Fernandinho does not need to look: He knows where Sterling is.Now Sterling cushions the ball, perfectly, back to Ilkay Gundogan, a few yards behind him, but his work is not done. He dashes forward again, in expectation rather than hope.Gundogan flicks the ball over Arsenal’s defensive line, disorientated, straight back to Sterling. It looks like creativity, like Gundogan is extemporizing, because that is what we want it to be, because that would make it somehow magical, but the chances are it is exactly the opposite: He will have played that ball, and Sterling will have made that run, a thousand times in training, until the timing is perfect and Pep Guardiola is satisfied.Only a few seconds have elapsed, but the trap has been set. Sterling is in, down the left side of Arsenal’s penalty area, and Sergio Agüero knows where he has to go, where he is meant to be. By now it seems, from the crowd, to be effortless, almost telepathic, but it is mechanical, really. Agüero has materialized at the far post. The ball is at his foot. The goal is open.That was the second of the three goals that Agüero, and Manchester City, scored in a 3-1 victory against Arsenal on Sunday, though it was not especially different in style from the first or the third: The only real variation, the only distinguishing mark, was how he chose to convert. He put the first past Bernd Leno with his head, the second with his foot, and the third, though the referee Martin Atkinson did not spot it, with the help of his arm.There was a sense of inevitability about all three of them, a dread predictability. Not because Arsenal — with its new manager and its handful of new players and its new dawn after years of elegant decline under Arsène Wenger — is still, at heart, the most generous and most accommodating of opponents, but because that goal is now City’s hallmark, its calling card.This has been a challenging week for Manchester City. Guardiola kept his players in their changing room for some time after a defeat at Newcastle United on Wednesday, picking over the flaws that had led to their downfall. It had been a fourth defeat in nine league games; something was amiss.Even first-place Liverpool’s failure to take advantage of the slip-up 24 hours later, Jürgen Klopp’s team drawing at home against Leicester City, brought little solace. “We said that we did not recognize our team,” Guardiola said. “The players felt it, too. We did not recognize what we were.”What they needed, then, was a reassertion of identity, and there is no better expression of that identity — of what this City team is, or of what its manager would like it to be — than that second goal. “We have scored a lot like that,” Guardiola said after the game.That is something of an understatement. No team in the Premier League has scored more goals from cutbacks this season, according to the analytics company Opta; 19 of City’s 66 goals this year have been scored from inside the 6-yard box. City scores that goal so often that it has become its default setting. Here, it felt almost like it was a comfort blanket, this City team’s artful, devastating version of going back to basics. Guardiola’s players do not have to think to score that goal. They can do it on autopilot.That was true during the manager’s time at Barcelona and at Bayern Munich, too, of course: More than City’s goal, it is Guardiola’s. Perhaps, in time, just as a chipped penalty has become known as a Panenka for the man who made it famous, a far-post tap-in from a low cross will take his name.He has done more than anyone else, after all, to evangelize its effectiveness: According to his journalistic confidante, Martí Perarnau, Guardiola has always agreed with his erstwhile Barcelona teammate Miquel Soler that a “hard, low cross across the 6-yard box is a goal half-scored.”It is the goal he encouraged Jordi Alba and Dani Alves to help create at Barcelona, though neither needed much encouragement. It is the goal he schooled Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry in assisting in Germany, his only acquiescence to the differing quality of the two squads being that he allowed the latter pair to cross the ball in the air, rather than along the ground — sometimes.It is the goal that has characterized City’s success, too, since he arrived here: 57 times, one of his players has scored from inside the 6-yard box in his time in England. It is as if Guardiola has discovered a glitch in soccer’s software, a gamer who has found a cheat that works every time.Unai Emery, the Arsenal manager, would have known that is what Guardiola would try to do, what City would try to do. He is, after all, a compulsive viewer of forthcoming opponents, a dogged analyst, given to spending hours poring over video.In the last few days, Emery would have seen that goal countless times, the footage taking on a metronomic, hypnotic quality as City worked the ball out wide, fired in a low cross, over and over, again and again. He would have drilled his defenders in how to cope with it, in what to look for, in anything and everything that might work.But that is the thing: Once the machine is working, there is little that can stand in its way. It is the most predictable goal in English soccer, but that does not seem to diminish its effectiveness.“They have the quality, the capacity,” Emery said, when asked if there is anything that can be done to stop Guardiola’s teams from performing their signature piece, casually idling through their greatest hit, whether knowledge can be power. “It can be hard to stop that.”"
"The Truth According to Zlatan - The New York Times
LOS ANGELES — Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after a quiet off-season with his family in Sweden, returned to training camp with the Los Angeles Galaxy this winter to find bulldozers and construction crews at work on a new plaza outside the team’s stadium.As a part of the refurbishment, the club will be unveiling a statue of David Beckham, a seminal figure in the evolution of Major League Soccer, in the plaza this weekend. Ibrahimovic, who, at 37, is nearing the age at which soccer legends are memorialized for the trophies they won and the goals they scored, said he was happy for Beckham, a former teammate of his at Paris St.-Germain and a two-time M.L.S. Cup winner with the Galaxy.Could Ibrahimovic envision the team building a statue for him someday?“We’re discussing,” he said in an interview after a recent practice. “Not one — two. One in the front, one in the back. And one in the middle of the stadium. So, three!”Ibrahimovic, the iconic striker, tends to serve up his brand of supreme confidence with a disarming smile and a subtle wink, and suddenly you feel as if you are in on the joke. Except it is not a joke. Not really. Ibrahimovic seems sincere about all the stuff he says: the boasts about his greatness; the odes to his goal-scoring prowess; the comparisons to lions and gods; the third-person soliloquies about all things Zlatan. Yet no matter how extreme or insightful or hilariously bold his claims become, his delivery — always with a wink and a smile, not to mention the résumé to back it all up — somehow helps it go down more easily.Consider his line of grooming products, which includes deodorant, liniment balm and tattoo enhancer cream. Ibrahimovic said he had personally helped develop several types of cologne — Zlatan Black Nomad, anyone? — and that he guaranteed results.“Oh, you will feel powerful, don’t worry,” he said. “They don’t need to see you. They just need to smell you.”In the same way, one gets the sense Ibrahimovic was not joking when he pledged to “break every record in M.L.S. this season” at a recent fan event. (Asked if he had any particular records in mind, he replied, “All of them.”) And he was absolutely not joking when, upon signing with the Galaxy last March, he bought a full-page advertisement in The Los Angeles Times. “Dear Los Angeles,” it read. “You’re welcome.”A few months later, when LeBron James announced that he, too, was moving to Los Angeles, to sign with the Lakers, Ibrahimovic welcomed him via his Instagram page.“Now L.A. has a God and a King,” he wrote.Ibrahimovic — who, to be clear, was the god in that situation — joined the Galaxy last year after star turns with European powerhouses like Juventus, Barcelona and Manchester United. Joining the Galaxy, he finished with 22 goals in 27 games but fell short of leading the team to the postseason, a disappointment for a player who has added to his collection of championship trophies — more than two dozen at last count, in five European leagues — nearly everywhere he has played.So Ibrahimovic has created a new challenge for himself this season: to dominate on a new continent with a surgically repaired knee and countless skeptics — real or imagined — fueling him.“The age, the knee, not like before — all this baloney,” said Ibrahimovic, who used a more colorful word than baloney. “They trigger me.”Ibrahimovic’s stateside odyssey was a long time coming. He recalled making his first trip to America in 1999, as a 17-year-old prodigy with Malmo, his hometown club in Sweden, for a summer youth tournament near Minneapolis. He visited Los Angeles about 10 years later, at the height of his powers, for a training camp with the Italian club Inter Milan. The team worked out twice a day, which left little time for sightseeing.“You see the football field, you see the hotel and you see the bus,” Ibrahimovic said. “I mean, I heard that a lot of characters live in Los Angeles, a lot of personalities — actors, singers, all of this. And I was curious: Why do people live here?”He investigated when he spent a month at the Beverly Hills Hotel with his wife and their two sons before he joined Manchester United in 2016. They enjoyed the weather and the easygoing vibe. “I think the sun brings energy, brings happiness,” Ibrahimovic said.When he sustained a serious knee injury with Manchester United the following year, he got a rare sense of his own sporting mortality — and it persisted when he faltered during his comeback.“It was not easy,” he said. “I didn’t feel comfortable. It was different.”He was also eager for a fresh start. Enter the Galaxy, who signed him a few weeks into last season for the bargain-bin price of $1.5 million. Ibrahimovic’s arrival at Los Angeles International Airport was streamed live on the internet, and Tomas Hilliard-Arce, a defender then in his rookie year with the Galaxy, said he was among the viewers.“I kind of felt like it was a big day for me for some reason,” Hilliard-Arce said, “because I got to meet a hero.”It was soon clear to his new teammates that Ibrahimovic wanted to incorporate himself into the fabric of the team, no small thing for a player of his stature. As he prepared for his first game, the inauguration of the Galaxy’s nascent cross-city rivalry with Los Angeles F.C., he made playful small talk with Emmanuel Boateng, a young midfielder.“I’m going to need you to score two goals today,” Ibrahimovic said.Ibrahimovic started the game on the bench, where he sat next to Hilliard-Arce. After the Galaxy gave up two quick goals, and then another at the start of the second half, Ibrahimovic began to mutter to himself. “I think he was mostly just psyching himself up,” Hilliard-Arce said.Ibrahimovic entered the game in the 71st minute and promptly delivered a dose of his hallmark magic: a stunning half-volley from nearly 40 yards and then a headed game-winner in stoppage time. Amid the celebrations, Ibrahimovic sought out Boateng.“I told you to score two goals,” Ibrahimovic said. “But since you couldn’t do it, I had to do it myself.”The rest of the season was less pleasant for the Galaxy — “Let’s say it went not good,” Ibrahimovic said — and the club regrouped by hiring a new coach, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, who was coming off a successful stint with Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, and by re-signing Ibrahimovic to a one-year deal worth a league-record $7.2 million.“The club wanted to give me a 10-year deal,” Ibrahimovic said, “but I said, ‘One year at a time.’ Because I need to feel good physically, and I don’t want to put the club in a situation where they’re stuck with me and I cannot perform for them.”For all his self-assurance, though, there are jarring moments when Ibrahimovic at least seems to acknowledge the toll of age and injury.“Imagine how I was last year? And then think five years, 10 years back,” he said. “I would do the same things but repeating them 10 times more. I was a machine. You could not stop me. And this is not me trying to make myself big for you. This is who I was. I was a different animal. I’m still an animal, but I was a different animal.”Yet even at 37, Ibrahimovic has the same gravelly voice, the same marbled physique and the same sharp edge. His teammates say that he raises the intensity of everyone around him, and that every moment on the field is a competition to him. In training, he wants to win every drill so he has bragging rights in the locker room. And he does not hide his disgust when things do not go well.“What shouldn’t be lost in his big personality is that this is one of the best players to ever play the game,” Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, said. “And his focus on being a consummate professional is really his biggest value.”Ibrahimovic’s transparency runs counter to the way many high-profile American athletes carry themselves. He has found that they tend to be too conscious of their image, he said — so polished, in fact, that they come off as artificial.“I’m not an act,” Ibrahimovic said. “I will do mistakes, and I will learn from mistakes, and I will do mistakes again, and I will learn. I’m not perfect. I’m just being myself.”He does not, for example, need to travel with a group of 20 advisers, he said. He does not need a stylist. He does not need to censor himself. He does not need to be anyone other than Zlatan, because usually that is more than enough.“I am the real deal,” Ibrahimovic said as readied himself for a new season. “I am coming, and I am original.”"
"Opinion | Running From Bahrain’s Dark Side - The New York Times
MELBOURNE, Australia — I will never forget the love and support I was greeted with the moment I arrived here on Feb. 12 after spending 76 days in detention in Thailand. The combined international engagement on my case is what gave me my freedom back. I am home now with my wife, and for that we deeply thank all who played a role in my safe return.What kept me going during these dark 76 days? Knowing that the whole world was witnessing the injustice. Millions of people saw me barefoot and shackled at a hearing in Bangkok, not because I had committed any crime — I had not — but because, I believe, Thailand’s ruling family happened to be tightening its relations with the Khalifas, the family that rules Bahrain, where I was born and which I had represented on its national soccer team. The shackles were humiliating. I am not a criminal, though I had been tried in absentia on what are widely accepted to be made-up charges — including the nonsensical accusation that I participated in burning a police station at a time I was playing soccer in a televised match — and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. I strongly believe my only “crime” was upsetting the Bahraini royal family by drawing attention to the failure of Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, to protect athletes, and his alleged involvement in their arrest and torture, after pro-democracy demonstrations in the country in 2011.  I escaped Bahrain in 2014 after learning of the charge against me, and took up residence in Australia, where I was granted refugee status in 2017. Feeling safer, I often forgot there were still unfair charges against me, and my wife and I planned our honeymoon.I arrived in Thailand only to find myself rapidly separated from my wife and confined to a detention center. Many people believe that my return to Australia was a glorious victory, but to me it is only a half victory. I am safe and reunited with my wife, but I am also reminded that my dream of eventually going back to Bahrain will not be a reality any time soon.Bahrain has only a jail cell to offer me, while Australia is now my home and its government and people have stood by me.While in prison, I had a long time to consider how I got there. I have no doubt my imprisonment in Thailand was a punishment for my criticism of Sheikh Salman, a member of the Bahraini royal family, during his 2016 campaign to be elected president of FIFA, the international soccer organization. My highlighting of his alleged violations of human rights in 2011 likely contributed to his failure to win the election.I am a free man now, but what about the more than 150 Bahraini athletes and sports officials who were arrested and in some cases tortured in 2011? Some remain in prison to this day. No credible investigations into these abuses were carried out.There is a dark side to sports in Bahrain. The kingdom uses wealth and sports to whitewash its legacy of abuses, and silences those who try to draw attention to this pattern.The activist Najah Ahmed Yousif was tortured, sexually abused and imprisoned in 2017 for daring to criticize the Bahrain Grand Prix auto race, and the journalist Ahmed Ismail Hassan was shot and killed while attempting to cover protests surrounding the race in 2012. Salah Abbas Habib Musa, a protest leader, was shot by the police during the weekend of the race, and nobody was held accountable for his death. Next month Formula One racing is scheduled in Bahrain; if the Formula One management fails to secure the release of Ms.Yousif, it should cancel the race. In Bahrain there are consequences for speaking up, but I am willing to take a personal risk and stand up for human rights no matter what, as are many brave Bahrainis. Don’t be mistaken, as I was when I went on my honeymoon to Thailand: I may be free now, but I and many other peaceful critics remain a target for Bahrain. Relatives of my friend Sayed Ahmed are imprisoned in Bahrain for his speaking out against the regime from his home in London. This week, Bahrain’s court upheld its three-year sentence in what the United Nations considers an unlawful act of reprisal through family connections. Bahrain has been emboldened thanks to President Trump, who has made it clear to Bahrain that “there won’t be strain with this administration.” The United States was in a powerful position to help end my ordeal, but instead it chose to stay silent. Indeed, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo traveled to Bahrain and praised the strategic partnership between the two countries, but made no mention of my case. Not only did he not mention my situation while I was still detained in Thailand, he failed to raise the issue of human rights at all. The United States had the means to use its leverage, since Bahrain is a close ally and host of the Fifth Fleet, but it failed to take a stance. Britain, similarly and shamefully, avoided offering support for my situation.If Bahrain has learned anything from seeking to extradite me, it is that the government can arrest, torture and repress its people and countries like the United States and Britain will continue to look the other way. My case underscores Bahrain’s enormous power to flout international standards, like lodging an illegitimate “red notice” with Interpol to stop a refugee while he travels. It also shows Bahrain that the United States and Britain consider their own interests more important than the lives of individual Bahrainis. These countries are abandoning human rights at a time when things are worsening in Bahrain and will only continue to deteriorate.I am so fortunate to have been able to return to Australia and continue my life, but many other Bahrainis are not as lucky. If they received the same level of international support I did, they might be enjoying the same freedom I am now."
"At Ajax, One Star Goes, Another Is Going, and More Are Always Coming - The New York Times
AMSTERDAM — Last summer, seven of Ajax’s brightest stars were summoned to a room at the Dutch club’s training facility. Edwin van der Sar, the goalkeeper-turned-chief-executive, and Marc Overmars, once a jet-heeled wing and now the Ajax sporting director, had a video to show them.Its premise was simple. Each of the players was paired with an iconic figure from Ajax’s illustrious history, one who shared a position, a nationality or (in one case) a bloodline. Goalkeeper Andre Onana, in one example, had van der Sar. Forward Kasper Dolberg got Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Justin Kluivert was juxtaposed with his father, Patrick. Frenkie de Jong had Christian Eriksen, and Matthijs de Ligt was compared to Barry Hulshoff, a defender from Ajax’s all-conquering team of the 1970s.The idea, van der Sar said, was to “show them how to become a legend at Ajax, and in Holland.” The film was designed to persuade the players, the club’s crown jewels, to resist the temptation to move to England, to Spain, to Italy, for another year or so, to “stay with each other, to win prizes and trophies here and then make the next step.”The tactic worked. Six of the seven players should feature for Ajax when it hosts Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday. De Ligt will marshal the defense. De Jong will orchestrate the attacks.Only one of the seven will be absent: Kluivert resisted the emotional overture to follow in his father’s footsteps. He refused to extend his contract and was sold to Roma. At Ajax, they understand why he made that decision — the allure, for a teenager with a famous name, of forging his own path — but when they mention Kluivert now, it is with a hint of regret, a tinge of frustration.Not because he left, but because he left so soon. “If a player goes after just half a year in the first team, like Kluivert, we are disappointed,” said Said Ouaali, the director of De Toekomst, Ajax’s famed youth academy.In January, Ajax made another video. This time, it was for public consumption, posted on the club’s social media channels. It was a little more than a minute long, but it showcased all of what Erik ten Hag, Ajax’s current manager, called de Jong’s “special qualities.” It was titled, “Frenkie Futuro,” and was released to celebrate the confirmation of the 21-year-old’s move to Barcelona, set to be completed this summer.De Jong is the shining light of this Ajax team, a player so promising that he has, more than once, been compared to Johan Cruyff himself. Yet there was no regret at his departure. “Barcelona, enjoy the future, like we do,” Ajax wrote on its official Twitter account.The feelings will be the same, this summer, when de Ligt — a player who has been at Ajax since he was 8 — departs, as he is expected to do. A 20-year-old defender who is regarded by some Premier League scouts as the best prospect in any position in world soccer, de Ligt could join his friend at Barcelona, or he might end up at Juventus.Either way, there will be no sadness, no sense of loss at what might have been. Ten Hag might allow himself to wonder a little, he said, at what could happen if “I could keep them for two or three years,” into their prime, but that is it.“I will be proud,” he said. “The scouts who found them will be proud. Marc Overmars will be proud. Everyone will be. If they transfer to a big club, you are happy for them.”This is, of course, what Ajax has always done. Since Cruyff himself left for Barcelona in 1973, it has churned out a stream of talent for others to enjoy: Johan Neeskens, Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Kluivert, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart, Eriksen, Ibrahimovic, Jan Vertonghen, Luis Suárez. The Ajax alumni list reads like a who’s who of modern soccer.The formula that has allowed it to do so hangs on the wall in ten Hag’s office, opposite a series of black-and-white portraits of Rinus Michels, the mastermind of the great team of the 1970s; Cruyff, its star; and Louis van Gaal, the man who restored Ajax to the European pinnacle in the 1990s, with a team reared almost entirely at De Toekomst.Ten Hag laughs when he looks at that wall — “They set you a standard,” he said, blowing out his cheeks — but he is serious when he discusses the Ajacied, a cross between a mission statement and a creed for the club.These are the traits the club seeks to instill in every player who wears its jersey, or who passes through De Toekomst, as well as its coaches and staff. There are 11 of them; they have been arranged like a team. This being Ajax, they are set out in a 4-3-3 formation. They range from taking responsibility and initiative to remaining disciplined and having fun.The approach, clearly, works. No team in Europe produces more professional players than Ajax. The club’s figures put it ahead of Partizan Belgrade and Dynamo Kyiv. According to Ouaali, a staggering 86 percent of players who are at De Toekomst at age 16 will go on to have pro careers.But that is not to say it has not been adapted, altered, fine-tuned over the years. That process started in 2011, when Cruyff returned to a club that — in van der Sar’s words — “did not feel like Ajax anymore.” Cruyff and the cadre of former players he brought with him wanted not only to restore the focus on youth development, to shed highly paid, aging players, but to change the way Ajax worked.“We focus always on the individual,” Ouaali said. “We don’t think about age groups, like the Dutch federation or like other clubs. It can be hard for coaches because they want results as well — to be successful, to be promoted to the next step up — but we try to find coaches who focus on the development of players, who learn the individual, not the team.”The club recognized, too, that it had to work faster than before. Players were no longer staying in the Eredivisie until they were 23 or 24; they were leaving at 20 or 21, if not earlier. “At 19, they needed to be ready to play in the first team,” ten Hag said, “because at 20, they are gone.”That meant more physical work at younger ages, and an end to players going to school outside Ajax. Now, they study at De Toekomst, so they can maximize the hours they spend in the classroom and on the training field.Ajax borrowed methods found in Montessori education to mix age groups, and its under-18 team was abolished to “increase pressure on the talent,” Ouaali said.The club’s second team, Jong Ajax — which plays in Dutch soccer’s second tier — no longer would be filled with senior players; now, most of its members are still in their teenage years. “We had to speed up the process,” ten Hag said. “They had to be good quicker.”All of it was a formal acknowledgment of Ajax’s place in the 21st century soccer firmament. It is telling, for example, that Ouaali sees his job, and that of De Toekomst, not as to produce players for the first team, but to produce them for “Ajax, then the Dutch national team, then the top international level.”The order is important. Ajax is not just about developing players; it is also concerned with winning. Van der Sar, in particular, was keenly aware of the need to keep its protégés long enough to benefit from them. It is why he has loosened the wage budget enough to make staying around for an extra year or two appealing. It is why the club is seeking to expand its global footprint, opening an office in New York; agreeing to run a youth system at Guangzhou R&F, the Chinese Super League team; finding ways to monetize its name.De Jong and de Ligt have done what they were asked to do when they watched that video last summer. They might not have won a trophy, but by carrying Ajax to the last 16 of the Champions League, to a meeting with Real Madrid, they have “given something back,” as van der Sar put it.When they — and possibly other members of the seven — depart, they will go with the best wishes of the club, and then the whole system will start again.That, after all, is Ajax’s real gift: its ability not to produce one player, or one generation of them, but to keep on going. It is what makes players’ leaving not only desirable but necessary.“We have to give the path to the next one,” van der Sar said. “If players stay too long, the next one cannot play. The whole thing chokes.”He cited an example from just a couple of years ago. Davy Klaassen was Ajax’s captain then. He was 24. The club had high hopes for a young midfielder, Donny van der Beek, but he needed a place to play.“Donny was saying, ‘O.K., Davy, come on now, it’s your time to go,’” van der Sar said.Klaassen did go: to Everton. On Wednesday, van der Beek will be in midfield against Real Madrid. Another player, another one off the production line, giving something back."
"Spanish Great Villa Out to Make More History in Japan - The New York Times
KOBE, Japan — David Villa is happy to chat about many things -- the various leagues he has played in, his family, how travel broadens the mind and even beef -- but when the question of retirement comes up, it draws only a wry smile to his face. Unquestionably one of the greatest strikers ever to emerge from the Spanish game, Villa has won enough medals for two or three careers but, despite having entered his 38th year, he is still hungry for more. So, fresh from the treatment table at his eighth club on a fourth continent, the Spanish national team's record goalscorer will offer only a nod towards his legacy when asked about hanging up his boots. ""I don't think a lot about this now, because I am still playing, I am still creating my history,"" he told Reuters in an interview at Vissel Kobe's training centre just outside Japan's sixth largest city.""But, if you ask me, then I would like to be remembered for... if you asked the teams that I played for then they would say a player that gives everything for the club, day-by-day in training and in games.""(Someone who has) respect for the team, the shirt and everybody in the culture of the club 100 percent.""That is the most important for me and is the things I have tried to do in the teams of my career, that's it.""Villa's goals have helped win a World Cup, a European Championship, the Champions League, a hat-trick of La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey with three different clubs.At Kobe, he has already scored three goals in five games as he bids to add a J.League winners' medal to his cluttered trophy cabinet and said anyone who expected a drop in standards was always going to be disappointed. ""I try to lead by example,"" he added. ""I don't believe in any other way, other than working day-by-day to be stronger. ""It doesn't matter if you're playing for Barcelona, Vissel Kobe or Sporting Gijon, where I started, or the national team when I was top of my career. ""It doesn’t matter. The secret for me is to work day-by-day to be better and I don't have any other secrets.""GREAT EXPECTATIONS The small, quiet Kobe training centre does not look like the centre of a lucratively-funded revolution in Japanese soccer but this is where Villa and his fellow World Cup winners Andres Iniesta and Lukas Podolski come to work every day.Bankrolled by Rakuten CEO and Japan's seventh richest man, Hiroshi Mikitani, Kobe have never managed higher than seventh in the J.League and last year, with Iniesta and Podolski on board, finished mid-table. Following Mikitani's investment –- 24-year-old midfielder Sergi Samper is the latest high profile recruit from Barcelona -- there is an expectation that the most expensive squad ever assembled in Japanese soccer should coast to the title.With three wins from their first five games of the season, Kobe are fourth in the league and trail early leaders Nagoya Grampus by two points.Villa understands the expectation and said it was something he had dealt with all his life from his early days at Sporting Gijon, through his time at Zaragoza, Valencia, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid as well as in 98 internationals.""The pressure for me has always existed, it doesn't matter the country, the team or the position you have in the team,"" he said. ""I always put pressure on myself because many people are waiting for you to do well.""It's not about being more high-profile than other players or something like that, it's only because I want to be good.""FOOTBALLING NOMADVilla and his family -- he has three children -- have embraced all that Japan has to offer and he is particularly partial to the local speciality, Kobe beef.""I am happy with this experience, it doesn’t scare me. The most important thing for me is that my family are well in the country and they can accommodate themselves quickly,"" he said. ""Here in Vissel, everybody has helped me a lot from the start, me and my family to accommodate ourselves in the country well.""Villa arrived in Japan after a four-year spell in Major League Soccer with New York City, which included a four-match guest stint with sister club Melbourne City in Australia.Now a confirmed footballing nomad, Villa said it was not something he even considered when growing up the son of a miner in Asturias.""It is things that have arrived in my career,"" explained Villa.""When I was a kid, I always dreamed about playing soccer and playing soccer for the national team.""But things in soccer arrive –- the same thing happened when arriving for Zaragoza, Valencia, arrive to New York, going to Melbourne and now I am here in Kobe in Japan. ""I try to enjoy and not think too much in the future, think of today only, and go day by day."" (Reporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Nick Mulvenney)"
"Politics Looms Over Empty Seats as Saudi Arabia Faces Qatar in Asian Cup - The New York Times
ABU DHABI — Qatar forward Almoez Ali joined a small group of record-makers at the Asian Cup last week, becoming only the fourth player in the tournament’s history to score four goals in a single game. His exploits in his country’s 6-0 thrashing of North Korea were cheered by just one fan sporting the Gulf country’s colors.That was one more than team officials expected.That is because the Asian Cup is being played this month in the United Arab Emirates, one of the main players in the punishing Saudi Arabia-led blockade of Qatar that began in 2017 and already has led to inconveniences for visiting Qatari officials, visiting Qatari journalists and, clearly, given their tiny number, visiting Qatari fans. The looming specter of the political dispute has produced a surreal air around Qatar’s matches, one that is expected to be repeated at its showdown against Saudi Arabia on Thursday at Zayed City Sports Stadium.Because of the geopolitical implications, that match could be one of the most-watched games of the tournament, though it will most likely not include many, if any, Qataris in the stands. The official attendance figure for the Qatar-North Korea game on Sunday in Al Ain was announced as 452, though several people who attended said the actual number most likely was closer to 100. Similarly low attendance figures have been a feature of the tournament, Asia’s most important soccer championship, in its first two weeks.The one flag-waving fan in Qatar’s maroon colors Sunday was a South Korean woman who had traveled from her homeland to root for Qatar, according to Qatari officials. Two other unidentified men sat nearby behind a Qatari flag, a rare spot of color in a sea of white seats. The sparse crowd only avoided setting another tournament record, for the lowest attendance, because of two groups of fans bused in by North Korea’s delegation.The soporific atmosphere most likely will give way to something far different and far more political when Qatar and Saudi Arabia meet to decide the winner of Group E. The countries have not met on the soccer field since diplomatic ties between the countries were severed 18 months ago, but the game’s location in this Emirate capital adds another layer of tension.“That’s almost more difficult to imagine than the U.S. national soccer team playing Iran in Tehran,” said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House, a British foreign-affairs think tank. “There will be some jittery people in Qatar hoping their players make it home.”Political intrigue large and small is nothing new at the Asian Cup. On Tuesday, Palestine played Jordan, which has been home to Palestinian refugees for over half a century. A day later, Iran faced Iraq. Yemen, which is on the brink of famine amid a prolonged Saudi-led assault on Houthi rebels, is among the first-time participants in the event.This year’s tournament also has been accompanied by significant issues in the soccer world. The A.F.C.’s president, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, a member of the Bahraini royal family, has been assailed over his silence about the fate of Hakeem al-Araibi, a refugee soccer player of Bahraini descent who was detained in Thailand on the orders of Bahrain’s government. And the event is the latest staging point for discussions related to FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s desire to expand the 2022 Qatar World Cup to 48 teams, a move that almost certainly would require Qatar to share games with countries currently leading the blockade, as well as a simmering battle for the leadership of the A.F.C. Sheikh Salman faces two challengers: one from Qatar, and another from the U.A.E.But the main crisis at this year’s Asian Cup remains the ongoing blockade of Qatar. The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have been in lock step in their opposition to Qatar, which they have accused of financing terrorism, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close to Iran. The countries were especially incensed by Qatar’s support for a range of activists across the Arab world, including the political Islamists that other Gulf monarchs consider a threat to their rule.Qatar’s leaders have denied the accusations of interference and of financing terrorism, arguing that it is their country’s independence that has most angered their neighbors. But the blockade’s effects on the tournament is not difficult to spot.Saoud al-Mohannadi, a Qatari and the Asian Football Confederation’s senior official responsible for the tournament, was initially barred from traveling to the U.A.E. on the eve of the competition. Initially prevented from boarding a flight from Oman, he was allowed through a day later. Five journalists cleared to cover the event by the A.F.C. weren’t so lucky; they were turned back upon arrival, though one photographer was allowed in. (Saudi Arabia has 47 print reporters accredited for the tournament.)Local organizers and the Abu Dhabi Sports Council were not made available for interviews. Neither group responded to emailed questions related to the tournament.Complicating matters further is the tournament’s television agreement. Qatar’s beIN Sports holds the broadcast rights for the event, but several top hotels, including the guest rooms of the Fairmont, where A.F.C.’s official delegation is based, and the hotels adjacent to the stadiums refuse to air beIN’s lineup of channels.Since the start of the crisis, beIN’s broadcasts — matches for which it has paid hundreds of millions of dollars for the exclusive rights — have been pirated by entity known as beoutQ, which Qatar contends is based in Saudi Arabia. As it did during last summer’s World Cup, beoutQ is broadcasting the Asian Cup in its entirety, overlaying beIN’s logo with its own.Asian Cup organizers have issued statements of frustration and threats of legal action, with little effect. In Bahrain, Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, a son of the country’s ruler, posted a video on Instagram this week of his reaction to his country’s last-minute triumph against India on Monday. His chosen broadcaster, made clear by the logo on the screen, was beoutQ. (The A.F.C’s president is a member of Bahrain’s royal family.)On the eve of the game, beIN launched a website that outlined evidence against the channel, which it describes as a Saudi-supported operation.The broader dispute has been visible inside stadiums, too; at several, the partnership between the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia in opposition to Qatar is on display in banners that display both countries’ flags and a set of shaking hands.What will happen on the field Thursday at the Zayed Sports City Stadium remains anyone’s guess. At an under-19 game between the U.A.E. and Qatar in October, the Emirati captain refused to shake hands with his Qatari counterpart at the pregame coin toss.Qatari officials and players have tried to play down the political cloud hanging over their presence. They say they are focused on improving ahead of the next men’s World Cup, which Qatar will host in 2022.On Tuesday, Qatar’s players appeared to be in good humor as they ran out to practice around sunset at a local field in Abu Dhabi, joking and teasing one another as a group of Spanish coaches put them through their paces. Apart from having no fans present at its games, the team has not faced any issues with the A.F.C. and local tournament organizers, according to a spokesman for the Qatari soccer federation, Ali al-Salat. But the players were briefed to avoid discussing politics ahead of the Saudi Arabia match.“You might look at it as special, but in our case it’s not that special,” midfielder Salem al Hajri said in a short interview as he prepared to join Tuesday’s training session.Asked about the political implications of the game, Saudi Arabia’s captain and its coach both demurred, saying those thoughts were for others.“We are thinking exclusively on the sports part of the game tomorrow,” said Juan Antônio Pizzi, Saudi Arabia’s Argentine coach. “Whatever the surrounding issues, we are not entitled to talk about things off the field.”Al Hajri and his Qatar teammates are guaranteed at least one supporter. The South Korean woman at the team’s first two matches, Mary Lee, confirmed that she would attend. Her relationship with the team is a curious one; al-Salat said she has links to the Qatar embassy in South Korea.“We appreciate the support because she’s the only fan who holds the Qatari flag in the U.A.E.,” al-Salat said. In normal times, she would be joined by at least 2,000 Qatari fans, he said, but the regular flights between Qatar’s capital, Doha, and Abu Dhabi have also been shut down by the blockade.Qataris now need special clearance and two layers of vetting to travel into the Emirates, where many have family members. But without direct flights between the countries, fans interesting in traveling to the Asian Cup would be required to fly through another country — typically Oman or Kuwait — as the national team was required to do on its way here. (Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family who leads the soccer federation, has based himself in Oman and flies in for his team’s games.)Saudi’s soccer federation, meanwhile, has secured thousands of tickets for its games, but their fans’ presence has had little effect at a tournament notable for its paltry attendance figures. The lack of fans has created a strange atmosphere inside the stadiums, with loud music echoing around largely empty arenas and M.C.s who exhort those present to “make some noise.”Despite tickets priced as low as about $7, even neutral fans are staying away. Several migrant workers, a group that heavily outnumbers U.A.E. nationals in Abu Dhabi, said their biggest obstacle was not ticket prices or geopolitical intrigue but something far more basic: As one Nigerian taxi driver said, he was just too busy.“I’m always at work,” he said."
"Seat Cushions Believed to Be From Plane Carrying Emiliano Sala Are Found - The New York Times
LONDON — Parts of seat cushions believed to be from the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot that disappeared over the English Channel have been found on a French beach, the British authorities said on Wednesday.The cushions were discovered by the French authorities on Monday near Surtainville, a coastal area in northwestern France, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said in a statement.British investigators have identified a search area of approximately four square miles based on the plane’s path and last known radar position. A specialist vessel will search the seabed for the wreckage at the end of this week, weather permitting, the statement added.“We are aware that a privately operated search is also being conducted in the area, and we are liaising closely with those involved to maximize the chance of locating any wreckage and ensure a safe search operation,” the statement said.Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City after emerging as a prolific goal scorer for Nantes, in the French league. The plane carrying him and the pilot, David Ibbotson, disappeared en route to Cardiff on the night of Jan. 21; Mr. Sala was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day.An underwater search conducted by a high-tech submarine is scheduled to start at the end of the week, in what will be a privately led attempt to find the Piper Malibu plane, a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft.The initiative to start the private operation was made by Mr. Sala’s family, after the authorities decided end the search on Thursday.But people from all over the world have chipped in to help support of the family’s search for answers about what happened. Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Friday that by Wednesday evening had raised more than 369,000 euros, about $422,000, to aid the search.The page has attracted a significant amount of attention, including donations by soccer stars like Kylian Mbappé, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year, and Ilkay Gündogan, a German player with Manchester City in the Premier League.Cardiff City paid tribute to Mr. Sala on Tuesday, at its first match since he disappeared, against Arsenal in London. Players and staff wore daffodils in his honor, and his name was included in the team roster in the match-day program. Both Cardiff and Arsenal, which won the match, laid floral tributes to Mr. Sala at Emirates Stadium.At several English Premier League matches this week, the teams observed a moment of silence in memory of Mr. Sala.“It is very difficult to even describe how the players are feeling,” Sol Bamba, a Cardiff defender, told BBC Sport Wales.“We have all been affected by it — the lads, the city, the whole club.”News reports have questioned whether Mr. Ibbotson should have been piloting the plane. He held a private pilot’s license in the United States, and his medical certification was up to date, according to records on the Federal Aviation Administration’s website.But to fly the plane in Britain with a paying passenger, Mr. Ibbotson needed a commercial pilot’s license, and to fly at night, he needed a so-called instrument rating. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority would not comment on Mr. Ibbotson’s credentials, but the authorities said the investigation into the plane’s disappearance would cover personnel records.The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart.“This would not have posed a problem for a pilot with a current instrument rating, but difficult for a pilot without one,” David Learmount, a former flight instructor, said in an email.Shortly before the plane vanished from radar, Mr. Ibbotson requested and received permission from air traffic control to descend to 2,500 feet, possibly to go under the worst of the weather, or to avoid icing, which can cause a plane to crash.Willie McKay, Mr. Sala’s agent has told the BBC that he was involved in selecting the plane or the pilot and that he did not own the plane that flew Mr. Sala. He said the flight was organized through a man named David Henderson, “who has flown us and many of our players all over Europe on countless occasions.”"
"European Methods on an Argentine League Budget - The New York Times
AVELLANEDA, Argentina — Partially obscured by a rusting rack of weights, the back wall of the gym at Racing Club’s youth academy has been painted dark blue and daubed with symbols.On one side are four bright, color-coded dots; on the other, four numbered yellow circles. Rising from the floor are two miniature depictions of goal posts, no more than a foot wide; fixed at the top are two hooks, looped with string, a ball hanging from each.Diego Huerta, an assistant at the academy and one of the club’s scouts, walks past with barely a glance, stopping only when he registers the confused looks. At Borussia Dortmund, he explains, the academy boasts a Footbonaut, a futuristic piece of training equipment designed to improve speed of thought and skill of execution. Standing inside a cage, Dortmund players receive a ball every few seconds. Simultaneously, a box on one of the four walls will light up. The player must swivel, fire the ball into the correct box, and then be ready to receive the next pass.Dortmund is one of just two clubs in the world to have one; T.S.G. Hoffenheim is the other. Coaches believe that two or three minutes inside the Footbonaut can have the same impact as multiple training sessions, but it does not come cheap: Each machine costs from $2 million to $4 million, and requires updates to the software that runs it.That price tag is way beyond Racing’s means. It is working with a local software developer on a pared-down, budget-friendly equivalent, but in the meantime, its answer, adapted for the realities and restrictions of the game in Argentina, includes the dots and circles painted on the weight room walls, the soccer balls hanging from strings. “This,” Huerta said, “is our version.”The same ethos is struck through everything Racing does. Like all of Argentina’s traditional powerhouses, this is a club conscious of its history. The walls of the cafe at the academy are lined with images of former stars; half of the room is given over to an extensive timeline of the club’s achievements, from the swath of championships it claimed in the early part of the 20th century to its first Copa Libertadores success, in 1967.That year, it became the first Argentine team to win the Intercontinental Cup, beating the European champion, Glasgow Celtic, over two bad-tempered legs. It has styled itself “el primer grande” — the first of Argentina’s great clubs — ever since.Unusually, though, Racing is not beholden to that history, or content to be swaddled by its traditions. Argentina’s biggest clubs are run as social institutions, in which members vote for presidents every few years. The system is cherished as a bulwark against corporate creep, a way of ensuring that clubs’ identities are not leveraged to the highest bidder, but it can make them cumbersome and conservative, structurally resistant to change.In that context, Racing stands out as a bastion of innovation. It is not just the homemade Footbonaut. It is the support available to the 55 boys who live at the club’s academy, far in advance of what most of their peers in Argentina would be offered, ranging from social workers and psychologists to academic tutors. It is the approach to player development, centering less on results and more on individual progress. Most of all, it is the work done in a small, subterranean office in the parking lot of the club’s stadium.Here, Javier Weiner’s team of four scouts, including Huerta, sits at a bank of four desks, each one dominated by an iMac. The scouts scour games from Argentina’s lower leagues and a handful of South American countries on Wyscout, a content platform that streams action from across the world.Each scout has an area to cover: Weiner takes Argentina and Colombia; Huerta monitors youth soccer and Venezuela.Using the analytics service InStat, they compile dossiers on potential acquisitions, drawing together not just raw performance data but also players’ psychological, emotional and medical backgrounds. They track information from journalists on social media.Most clubs of this scale in Europe, North America and Asia would see this work as standard now; in Argentina, it is all but revolutionary. “Most of the time, it is the head coach who recruits players, or the president, with the help of a few agents,” Huerta said. “There is no process: Everything changes constantly. And there are times when crucial decisions are made by someone who does not know anything about football.”Racing, however, is determined to be “another type of club,” Weiner said. “We have to be creative,” he said. “We have to have a network that means we can get players before bigger clubs because financially we cannot compete with River Plate and Boca Juniors.”The mastermind behind that plan for the future is one of the towering figures from Racing’s past. His image hangs from not one poster, but two, in the hall at the academy.Diego Milito won two Argentine titles with Racing as a player, though most of his success came in Italy, where he was the attacking spearhead of José Mourinho’s treble-winning Inter Milan team. He returned to his boyhood team to see out his career in 2014. After retiring, in 2016, he was appointed Racing’s technical secretary, an equivalent to a director of football role.Milito’s goal, Huerta said, was to “make Racing a champion again.” He is on the cusp of doing just that: Racing sits atop Argentina’s Superleague, a first title since 2014 inching ever closer. Its journey, though, directed by Milito, has been unorthodox.“All the time Milito was in Europe, he saw how they were working, and he tried to adapt some of the ideas he found,” Huerta said. Scouting was central to that. One of Milito’s first appointments was Weiner, who had been working with his father, Gabriel, on his “mobile technical unit”: a freelance scouting operation, effectively, that carried out project work for European and North American clubs. “We had been commissioned by Bayer Leverkusen, Udinese, Chicago Fire and a few others,” Javier Weiner said. A Racing fan, he leapt at the chance to sign up permanently when Milito asked. Huerta’s route was a little different. A journalist by training, he spent four years working at Clarín, Argentina’s biggest news outlet, before starting to work with Martí Perarnau, once an Olympian for Spain and now a prolific journalist, author and the biographer of Pep Guardiola.Huerta’s connection with Perarnau allowed him to visit several of Europe’s most progressive clubs. “I talked to people from Dortmund, Sevilla, Barcelona, Olympique Marseille,” he said. “I went to watch Zinedine Zidane while he was coaching Real Madrid’s reserve team. I had read ‘Soccernomics’ and ‘Moneyball.’ I had some ideas on how to run a club.”He started doing video analysis and statistics work for Racing. When Milito arrived, he spotted Huerta’s gift for languages and recruited him into his inner circle. He now acts as a bridge between the scouting operation, the first team and the academy. “We did not have a structure before,” Huerta said. “Now we have a clear vision of what we want the club to be.”The best parallel he can find is with one of those clubs he visited on his tour of Europe: Sevilla, a team that has built sustained modern success among much bigger rivals by recruiting well and selling better.Racing has always had a reputation for youth development — the club is known, in Argentina, as La Academia — and that remains central to Milito’s plan. In his office at the academy, Huerta keeps a map of all the areas of Argentina where he has searched for talent.There has never been any shortage of that, of course — “Switzerland knows how to make watches, and we make players,” the grizzled academy director Miguel Gomis said — but there is a belief, too, that it can be done more effectively, more reliably.“We do not see the mistakes we make because no matter how badly we do things, players come through,” Gomis said.There is a focus, now, not on “training talent” — the endless slew of creative, attacking players that Argentina is famous for — but on “positions of concept,” the more defensive, more cerebral roles. “We want to create the players that Racing needs,” said Claudio Úbeda, a coach at the academy. “But also the players that Europe wants.”Racing is looking further afield than any of its rivals for that raw material. It is, Huerta said, often the only Argentine team that sends scouts to international youth tournaments. It has started to recruit players from Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.Just as significant, it has “formalized,” as Weiner put it, the other end of the process. “I remember seeing a couple of tall, blond guys in the crowd at one game,” Weiner said. “It turned out they were scouts from F.C. Copenhagen, in Denmark. There was nobody to help them get tickets to watch a player, so they just ended up behind the goal. We have changed that now.”So new that there remains some suspicion about it. The concept of scouting remains alien to some. Huerta is regularly asked by colleagues from other teams why he is bothering to watch lower tier games or follow players from Venezuela. There are skeptics within the club, too; Milito’s revolution has not been entirely peaceful. Change does not come easily, even with such a potent figurehead. The team he has built, though, has the courage of its convictions. Racing can see the future; or its own, homemade version of it, at least."
"Neville Urges Top Clubs to Open Stadiums for Women's Games - The New York Times
(Reuters) - England women's coach Phil Neville has called on the country's biggest clubs to host women's games at their main stadiums.Attendance at women's games in Europe has grown this season, with 60,739 watching Atletico Madrid play Barcelona at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium in Madrid earlier this month, a record for a women's club soccer match.Juventus Women set a record for a women's soccer match in Italy when 39,000 supporters attended their first game at the Turin club's Allianz stadium against Fiorentina on March 24, and Neville said it was time English clubs get in on the act.""Some of the big teams in England have got to open their stadiums and fill them and let's blow the rest of Europe away,"" Neville told reporters. ""Our game is in a far better place than Spain, Italy or Portugal.""If (second-tier leaders) Manchester United or (top-flight leaders) Arsenal win the league, throw open your stadium. Champions League game for Chelsea - why not play it at Stamford Bridge? Get 30,000 or 40,000.""England play Canada in a pre-World Cup friendly at Manchester City's Academy Stadium on Friday, a venue that can seat 7,000, and Neville added that should offer free tickets to supporters to fill bigger venues.

"How a Global Reputation Is Changing an Amateur Derby - The New York Times
BUNSCHOTEN-SPAKENBURG, the Netherlands — Every seat, every perch, every conceivable inch of space is occupied. The two grandstands that run alongside the field at the Sportpark de Westmaat are full. The extra bleachers that have been put up for the occasion, no more than scaffold and gangplanks, are full.Fans hang over railings and cram into corners, standing four or five deep, straining on their toes to get a decent view. Once all the feasible vantage points are gone, one or two decide that there is no other option than to head for the roof. It feels as if everyone in this sleepy seaside village, an hour or so southeast of Amsterdam, has turned out for the occasion, and several more besides.Ronald Koeman, the coach of the Dutch national team, is here; so is Aad de Mos, the veteran former coach of Ajax. Fans, less illustrious, have traveled the length and breadth of the country to be here.It is not normally like this. IJsselmeervogels — the team that calls the Sportpark home — ordinarily attracts crowds of around 1,500, or maybe 2,000 for a big game, according to Theo Muijs, the club secretary. Its games are shown only on regional television. It competes, after all, in the Tweede Divisie, Dutch soccer’s semiprofessional third tier.Today, though, is an 8,000-capacity sellout, and there are reporters and camera crews from Fox Sports posted around the field, too. For those who could not get a ticket, the game is being broadcast live on national television. Not bad for a third-division game in a village of scarcely more than 20,000 people. “We will make as much money from today as we will from the rest of the season,” Muijs said.The reason for that is simple: The visitor today is S.V. Spakenburg, a rival so local that the two clubs’ stadiums are all but contiguous. (They are both called the Sportpark de Westmaat, and share a parking lot; when the teams meet, Spakenburg’s players walk from their own home ground to the changing rooms at IJsselmeervogels.)This game is widely regarded as the “biggest amateur derby in Holland,” said Rob Commandeur, a fan who has made the trip from Heinkenszand, not far from the Belgian border, just to see it. Given the scale of the crowd, and the interest, there is a compelling case to be made that description undersells it a little.A Copa90 documentary in 2016 labeled IJsselmeervogels-Spakenburg the “world’s biggest amateur derby (probably).” In the village, they regard this game as fiercer than even Ajax and Feyenoord, the country’s most famous rivalry. “It is the derby of derbies,” Jan de Jong, an IJsselmeervogels fan, said.Spakenburg, a few hours before the game, does not quite give that impression. It is market day: Alongside the canal, stalls selling vast arrays of cheese and cold cuts do a steady trade. At the marina, beneath a forest of wooden masts, a couple of craftsmen whittle and plane away at their boat. Young men, wrapped up against the bitter cold, dangle fishing lines into the water.Aside from the occasional flash of color — a red IJsselmeervogels scarf, a hat adorned with Spakenburg’s blue badge — most residents keep their affiliations hidden underneath thick jackets. One or two silken flags have been draped from balconies. Down the side streets, where each house boasts not just a number but a small plaque denoting the name of the family who call it home, a few more flutter from doorways. Often, red and blue sit side by side, in those places where loyalties are split.There is a reason for the peace. Bars in Spakenburg are forbidden from selling alcohol until 5 p.m. on derby day, the legacy of sporadic outbreaks of violence in years gone by. Some suggest the problems were related to hooligans from professional teams — Ajax and ADO Den Haag, in particular — who used the game as an excuse to settle their own scores; others look a little closer to home.Regardless, the effect of the alcohol ban has been pronounced. Rather than thronging the town, fans now tend to gather at house parties instead. “We started at 11,” de Jong said. “We ate fish. Also there was beer.” He is swaying, just a little, as he says it.Occasional bursts of boisterous chanting echo around the streets, though the big celebration — an official fan party thrown by IJsselmeervogels fans — was held on an industrial estate a 40-minute walk away. That, too, you sense, is deliberate: A brisk walk in freezing temperatures has a conveniently sobering effect.It is as kickoff approaches that the fans appear: dozens at first, then hundreds, a great tide walking toward the Sportpark, so many that it seems impossible that the village seemed empty just a few minutes earlier. Slowly, the stadium begins to fill. Finally, the show starts.Those who grew up with the game have always regarded it as special. “You do not have a choice: You are either red or blue, from birth,” said Joran van Dierman, a red, here with his wife, Maureen, a blue. “Everyone remembers the first time they came to a derby.”In recent years, though, the game’s reputation has grown, particularly among a certain type of soccer fan. It has become a destination game, a kind of hipster bucket-list item for anyone seeking a jolt of authenticity, something untainted by the sanitized, prepackaged corporate glamour of the world’s elite leagues. “It is quite a cool mix,” said Commandeur, here with a clutch of his teammates from their hometown club. “It is an amateur game, but with a more professional vibe.”In the Netherlands, it is now what puts Spakenburg on the map. “I travel a lot for work, to Amsterdam, to Utrecht,” van Dierman said. “When people ask you where you are from, the first thing they say is: ‘Oh, Spakenburg. Are you a red, or are you a blue?’”That fame, though, has spread well beyond the Dutch border. “We have had requests from fans from Belgium, Germany, Austria, everywhere,” said Henk van de Groep, IJsselmeervogels’s communications manager.Muijs, too, has been inundated with requests. “There have been a lot of things on social media,” he said. “A few years ago, there was a list of the top 20 derbies in the world. Boca Juniors against River Plate was first. We were 19th. It’s not even a professional game!”The game’s appeal is not the standard of play, but the theater that surrounds it. “It is a strong rivalry, but in a good way,” said Reinie van de Groep (no relation to Henk); she grew up here, but regards herself as a “purple.” “It is very humorous, very creative,” she said.Fans of both clubs have, in the past, staged eye-catching stunts before the game. IJsselmeervogels fans released a live pig on Spakenburg’s field, a nod to their rivals’ reputation as the farmers’ team; Spakenburg responded by hiring a plane to release hundreds of inflatable toilet brushes over enemy territory. There have been banners depicting warlike Smurfs, and enormous, inflatable Vikings.This edition’s efforts center on “La Casa de Papel,” a Spanish Netflix series about a heist at the Royal Mint in Madrid. Before the game, the home fans unveil a huge mural depicting several of their players in the show’s red hoodies, above the slogan “La Casa de los Pájaros”: the Bird Cage. On the field, six men, their faces concealed by Guy Fawkes masks — another nod to the series — fire toy machine guns into the air. Fans are handed masks as they enter. Even the away section, clad in blue, has them, though nobody can quite explain the significance of the reference.There are streamers and glitter cannons and air dancers. The game kicks off 10 minutes late, in fact, because the display was so lavish that nobody seemed to have taken into account that all of the paraphernalia would have to be removed from the field. For much of the first half, players on one flank have to dodge not only opponents but the bright red streamers left littering the halfway line, too.The game, almost inevitably, feels something of an afterthought. IJsselmeervogels — historically the more successful of the two teams, and chasing a championship again this season — takes the lead. Spakenburg equalizes a few minutes later. Early in the second half, the host is reduced to 10 men, its midfielder Maikel de Harder sent off for lashing out at a Spakenburg player. It peters out into a feisty, full-blooded tie.By the end, the noise has abated a little. Fans start to filter out, clutching their masks as mementos. Perhaps the result has left everybody dissatisfied. Perhaps thoughts are drifting, now, to the lifting of the alcohol ban at 5 p.m.A few fans confide that this has been a more low-key affair than they had been expecting, that the previous encounter this season — also a tie — was a little more colorful, a little more of an occasion. They wonder if the novelty has worn off, or if the reputation now weighs too heavily, if the expectations are impossible to match.A few minutes after the game, the road out of Spakenburg is choked with traffic. Those who came from much further afield to watch the derby of derbies are starting to leave. They have had their weekend road trip, seen the world’s biggest amateur derby, ticked another item off the bucket list, devoured another experience. The locals walk home, to the houses with their names etched outside and the flags hanging from balconies, to clear up the detritus of the parties they hosted. Spakenburg will be quiet again soon, the same as ever. The game that defines it, though, is changing, an occasion that used to be exclusively local irrevocably altered, somehow, by its contact with the global."
