A Small Town Bet on Sports Gambling. It’s Still Waiting. - The New York Times,"TUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. ","When Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. ","But in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.","Then last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. ","The vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. ","The reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.","“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.","Since the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.","In all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.","West Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.","Rhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.","New Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. ","The nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.","Tribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.","A year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.","The area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. ","Along Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.","Before casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.",But legalized gambling brought change. ,Cotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.,"Early on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.","At the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.","But within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. ","As the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.","The effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.",Some residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.,"Mr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.","“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” ","Sports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.","But in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.","So far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.","In all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.","“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.","On a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. ","Pete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.","“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. ", ,"R. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.","“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”","Many gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.","“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”"
"'Awakening' Happening in Women's Sports, Says LA Mayor Garcetti - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES — The lawsuit recently filed by the U.S. women's soccer team is part of a wider public ""awakening"" to the challenges that women athletes face, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Reuters on Saturday. ","Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of an initiative aimed at the development of more women coaches, Garcetti said the suit against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging wage discrimination marked an important step toward gender equality.","""I think there is an awakening happening in women's sports whether it's abuse, discrimination or simply having basic civil rights denied,"" he told Reuters.","""I support women athletes who are saying enough is enough. That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,"" he said.","""It's an exciting moment to see that happening."" ","Closing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women's sports leagues, he said.","Women would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.","""The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,"" he said. ","""We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be."" ","The next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. ","""I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,"" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.","""Growing up I didn't see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,"" she said.","""I guess I didn't realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,"" she said.

Lower-Profile Sports Are at Center of Admissions Cheating Scandal - The New York Times,"They are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.","In college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.","Just like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.","The Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.","Unlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.","That is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.",[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.],"In short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”","The water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.","The practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.","Stanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.",Federal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.,"At the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.","According to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.","Kathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”","Even fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”","Meghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.","At U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.","The coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.",He told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”,"A month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.","According to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.","Stanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.","“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”",No school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.,"Singer is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.","The central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.","The school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.","Ali Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.","Wake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.","In a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”","The case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.","Prosecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.","“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.","“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.","Later, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”","“But she’s not,” Huneeus said."
"New Jersey Embraces Sports Gambling, and a Billion-Dollar Business Is Born - The New York Times","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.","Every Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.","She will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.","By next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.","“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”","Last May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.","On the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.","On the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.","“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”","As sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.","Figures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.","Legalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.","In two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.","The Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.","Last year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.","At the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.","“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”","The Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.","Millman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.","“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”","For now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.","“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”","Kerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.","With a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.","“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”"

How to Find a Sports Bra That Actually Fits - The New York Times,"At 12 years old, Holly Powell quit the swim team when her breasts outgrew her swimsuit. In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”","When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”","Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ","Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).","In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).","The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)","Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”","When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.","Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.","After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.","Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.","Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.","Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.","Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.","Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.","Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.","Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.","If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).","Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage."

Opinion | The Admissions Scandal Is Really a Sports Scandal - The New York Times,This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.,"Getting a peek inside the college-admissions process isn’t easy. But a team of academic researchers managed to do so several years ago. It helped, no doubt, that two of the researchers were former college presidents — William Bowen of Princeton and Eugene Tobin of Hamilton.","The researchers were given access to anonymous admissions records at 19 elite colleges and then analyzed how admissions offices treated different groups of students. Low-income students, for example, were no more likely to be admitted than otherwise similar students with virtually identical academic records. So-called legacy students — those whose parents attended the same schools — received substantial boosts. So did underrepresented minorities.",But the biggest boost went to recruited athletes: An athlete was about 30 percentage points more likely to be admitted than a nonathlete with the same academic record.,"I thought of that study yesterday, after the Justice Department announced it had indicted 50 people for trying to rig the admissions process. The alleged scam involved payments funneled from parents to college coaches, who in return would falsely identify applicants as athletic recruits to the admissions office. Just like that, the students then become virtual shoo-ins for acceptance.","If the accusations are true, they’re outrageous. But they also highlight a larger problem that has somehow become acceptable: A scam like this could exist only because competitive sports occupy a ridiculously large place in the admissions process. ","The situation is different for other extracurricular activities. Great musicians are more likely to be admitted to a college than similar students who don’t play an instrument — as is only fair, because musicians deserve credit for their accomplishments. But the musicians don’t generally receive a 30-percentage-point boost on their admissions chances. Stage managers for the high school theater don’t, either. Nor do student body presidents, debaters, yearbook editors or robotics competitors.","Athletes do. Their extracurricular activities are not treated merely as an important part of a college application, but as a defining part. “Athletic recruiting is the biggest form of affirmative action in American higher education, even at schools such as ours,” as Philip Smith, a former dean of admissions at Williams College, has said. It’s a relic of the supposedly character-defining role that sports played in elite colleges a century ago. ","And sports have retained their unique place in the admissions process even though most teams at elite colleges are not good enough to compete for national championships. To put it another way, the student athletes being recruited to these colleges are not among the very best in the country at what they do. They are extremely good, yes, and they work hard, yes — but that also tends to be true of high school musicians, student government leaders and so on.",I’m a sports fan and long-ago high school athlete. I have a lot of admiration for students who are talented enough and work hard enough to play sports in college. But they are not a different species. It’s time to end the extreme special treatment that colleges give to so many of them. College sports can still exist without it.,For more …,"At many selective colleges, about one-fifth of first-year students are recruited athletes, and the share is higher at some. At Williams College, for example, about 30 percent of students are recruited athletes, according to the college.","“Recruited athletes not only enter selective colleges with weaker academic records than their classmates as a whole but that, once in college, they ‘consistently underperform academically even after we control for standardized test scores and other variables,’” Edward Fiske wrote in a 2001 book review for The Times.","The Times’s editorial board notes that the indictments do not challenge the legal uses of money to influence the admissions process: “What the government actually is defending is private property — the right of the colleges to make their own decisions about admissions, and collect the payments.” And my colleague Frank Bruni weighs in as well."
Lobov Makes Bare-Knuckle Debut as Combat Sports Go Mainstream - The New York Times,"(Reuters) - Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight Artem Lobov, a long-time friend and team mate of Conor McGregor, is set to make a lucrative debut in bare-knuckle boxing as combat sports bid to gain more mainstream acceptance. ","Nicknamed the ""Russian Hammer"", Lobov told Reuters he had accepted a big payday from the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship to fight another UFC veteran, Jason Knight, on a pay-per-view card in Biloxi, Mississippi on Saturday. ","""I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse,"" he said during a stopover in New York. ","Long considered the only realistic professional alternative outside of boxing for combat sports athletes, the UFC is now competing with other mixed martial arts and grappling promotions. ","European and Asian promotions are attracting sellout crowds, and the Bellator organization recently signed a large number of British and Irish prospects to try to make inroads in Europe. ",They were also on the trail of Lobov when he was released from the UFC in January.,"""They made a very nice offer, a lot more than I was getting in the UFC, but it did not match the offer that Bare Knuckle made. With Bare Knuckle, I can also accept other offers as long as it doesn't interfere with their schedule, so it's a win-win for me,"" the 32-year-old said. ","""I get to go in, fight bare-knuckle, make a lot of money, hopefully build a better name for myself and then see what else is out there.""",FRONT FOOT,"Though he has a losing professional record of 14 wins and 15 losses, Lobov is hugely popular with fans due to his fearless style of fighting off his front foot and his toughness, with 12 of his MMA losses coming by decision. ",Lobov brushes aside the suggestion that bare-knuckle boxing is more primitive than MMA. ,"""It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times,"" he said. ""In that sense, it's nothing.","""I truly, truly love fighting, so that's not an issue for me. It's like saying to a swimmer, 'Do you mind getting wet?' Of course not, he's a swimmer,"" he said. ","Lobov credits Irishman McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, with bringing combat sports into the mainstream in the U.S. and enabling him and many others to make a living as fighters. ","""In many ways it is thanks to Conor, for sure, and it's definitely a lot better than before, but the best times are still ahead of us,"" Lobov said. ","""Ten years ago I fought a top-10 European fighter on four days' notice for 400 pounds, and to go from that to where I am now, earning six figures for a fight? Certainly, I see the improvements in the sport.""","Though delighted to have a chance to test his boxing without the threat of kicks or takedowns, Lobov will be back in the MMA cage soon. ","""I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge. I'm still grappling, I'm still wrestling and doing everything,"" he said. ","""I want to improve and to achieve many, many things in MMA, boxing and bare-knuckle boxing."" "," (Reporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond)"

Three free throws.,A comeback win transformed into a devastating loss.,"And within seconds, the pain and second-guessing of the final plays flowed from everywhere.

"" From the headlines: ""Foul Play .""",Lost somewhere amid all that agony at Auburn and euphoria in Virginia heading to the NCAA Tournament final was the fact that we've seen all this before.,No official is perfect.,No instant replay is going to fend off all mistakes.,"Even when the call is the right one, sports aren't always fair.","And when they're being played on the biggest stages, those facts of life are placed out there on vivid, often heart-wrenching display.","""At that level, you'd hope it's not going to happen because of what's at stake, but it's going to happen,"" said John O'Suillivan, founder of the Changing The Game Project , which teaches about keeping perspective in youth sports.

Ex-Sports Radio Host Craig Carton Sentenced in Ticket Resale Scheme - The New York Times,The sports radio personality Craig Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Friday by a longtime fan and listener — the judge — for a ticket reselling scheme that ended his broadcast partnership with the former N.F.L. quarterback Boomer Esiason.,"Carton, convicted in November of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud, was sentenced by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court.",She greeted him like a radio listener.,"“Good afternoon, Mr. Carton. Colleen from New York. First time, long time,” the judge said, adding that she used to listen to his show as she drove to court.","“I knew you could be fun to listen to,” she said. “I also knew you could be a jerk.”",The prison term was half of what prosecutors sought after Carton was convicted at a November trial of soliciting and then largely gambling away nearly $7 million.,"Geoffrey S. Berman, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a release that Carton’s ticket resale business, which purported to use his connections to obtain good seats for events like Metallica and Barbra Streisand concerts, was an “elaborate fiction.”","Carton, a 50-year-old Manhattan resident, blamed his fall from a measure of celebrity and wealth on “wildly stupid decisions” he made as he tried to cope with memories of being sexually abused at age 11.","He said memories of the abuse were set off by revelations of the crimes of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State football assistant who was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2012. That led him first to speak angrily and more emotionally than he ever had before on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton” show, which he co-hosted for years with Esiason. Then he could not sleep.","“Nobody knows what it’s like when lights go out and you lay in bed awake and the demons come,” Carton said.",He recalled turning to blackjack and eventually developing a gambling addiction so serious that winning and losing became irrelevant.,Carton said his arrest in 2017 was a “lightning bolt of awareness for me.” He said he had joined Gamblers Anonymous and was undergoing therapy.,"“I am truly powerless over this disease,” Carton said. His last bet — a loss — came in June, he added.","Before describing the sentence, the judge said she had enjoyed Carton’s show, except when it became too “raunchy.”","But she likened his crimes to those of the financier Bernard L. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence, though she said Madoff’s scheme, in which he squandered roughly $20 billion, went on far longer.","The judge dismissed Carton’s claims that he never meant to lose investors’ money, saying it was a common justification in financial crimes.","“The money always runs out at some point, and only then do you realize the road to your personal hell was truly paved with your good intentions,” she said.","“Craig Carton, you have indeed descended into a hell of your own making,” the judge said. “Everything you spent a lifetime of building up is gone. Your marriage is over. Your family is decimated. Your kids are terrified. Your career is in tatters. Your reputation is lost.”","She did, however, praise Carton’s plan to publicly urge others to stop gambling as she ordered him to pay $4.8 million in restitution and to forfeit $4.2 million. He also must do 150 hours of community service.","She said Carton could perhaps someday resume a radio show, which he left after his arrest, but she noted one of the biggest advertisers on sports radio shows seemed to be legal gambling businesses.","“That troubles me,” the judge said.",Carton must report to prison on July 15.

McGill University Drops 'Redmen' Name From Sports Teams - The New York Times,MONTREAL — McGill University has dropped the name Redmen from its varsity sports teams after receiving complaints that the name is a racial slur.,Principal Suzanne Fortier said in a statement Friday that the name had caused pain and alienation for indigenous students at the Canadian university. The change took effect immediately.,"""Today, 'redmen' is widely acknowledged as an offensive term for Indigenous peoples, as evidenced by major English dictionaries,"" Fortier said.","In recent years, American sports teams at amateur, college and professional levels have faced similar criticisms.","Last year, the Cleveland Indians baseball team removed Chief Wahoo as its logo. Stanford, North Dakota, St. John's (also once the Redmen) and Dartmouth are also among the colleges and universities that have dropped Native American nicknames or symbols for their teams.","However, longstanding pressure to change the name of the Washington Redskins NFL team has so far been unsuccessful.",McGill's decision comes after an internal report revealed deep divisions between students and alumni over the nearly century-old name.,"Even though the Redmen name was not initially adopted as a reference to indigenous people, the association was made in the 1950s when men's and women's teams came to be nicknamed the ""Indians"" and ""Squaws."" Some teams later adopted a logo with an indigenous man wearing a headdress.","The student who led the fight against the name told The Canadian Press he was ""ecstatic"" at the news.","""I had expected the name change,"" Tomas Jirousek said in an interview from Prague. ""I think if the principal had been actually listening to indigenous community members and students, I think it was the only possible option after, as she said in her email, 'the depth of pain' we feel as indigenous students at the Redmen name.""","Meanwhile, a group of alumni who opposed the name change said they would never again donate to McGill and would discourage their children from applying to the school."
"Dan Jenkins, 90, Chronicler of Sports in Raucous Prose, Dies - The New York Times","Dan Jenkins, a sportswriter whose rollicking irreverence enlivened Sports Illustrated’s pages for nearly 25 years and animated several novels, including “Semi-Tough,” a sendup of the steroidal appetites, attitudes and hype in pro football that became a classic of sports lit, died on Thursday in Fort Worth. He was 90.","He had experienced heart and renal failure and had recently broken his hip, said his daughter, Sally Jenkins, a sports columnist for The Washington Post.","Mr. Jenkins was among a cadre of Sports Illustrated writers — including Roy Blount Jr., Mark Kram and Frank Deford — recruited by André Laguerre, the managing editor who oversaw the magazine’s emergence as a leader in literate, and occasionally literary, sports journalism as well as a powerhouse in the Time Inc. stable. Mr. Jenkins joined the magazine in 1962.","A Texan with a good old boy’s pride in country common sense over urban sophistication, Mr. Jenkins brought a Southern wiseacre erudition to the pages of a magazine not exactly used to the arch or earthy or impolitic remark. Opinionated, more than occasionally snarky, he wrote with an open appreciation of athletes and coaches, bars, pretty women and chicken fried steak, replete with clever put-downs and outlandish metaphors.","His main beats were golf and college football, sports he grew up with in Fort Worth.","“The devoted golfer is an anguished soul who has learned a lot about putting just the way an avalanche victim has learned a lot about snow,” Mr. Jenkins wrote in an article for the magazine that earned him a full-time job there. “He knows he has used straight shafts, curved shafts, shiny shafts, dull shafts, glass shafts, oak shafts and Great Uncle Clyde’s World War I saber, which he found in the attic. Attached to these shafts have been putter heads made of large lumps of lead (‘weight makes the ball roll true,’ salesmen explain) and slivers of aluminum (‘lightness makes the ball roll true,’ salesmen explain) as well as every other substance harder than a marshmallow. He knows he has tried 41 different stances, inspired by everyone from the club pro to Fred Astaire in ‘Flying Down to Rio’ and as many different strokes. Still, he knows he is hopelessly trapped. He can’t putt, and he never will, and the only thing left for him to do is bury his head in the dirt and live the rest of his life like a radish.”","Mr. Jenkins was fond of toying with racial, ethnic, national and social stereotypes in a distinctly non-P.C. manner, and was especially defiant in doing so outside the stricture of magazine journalism, particularly in “Semi-Tough” his first and best-known novel, published in 1972.","The book is narrated by Billy Clyde Puckett, a star running back for the New York Giants and a Fort Worth native.","Set in the week leading up to an all-New York Super Bowl in which the Giants are to face the Jets, the novel is a pouring out of Billy Clyde’s observations and attitudes — brash, cynical, boastful, charming, shrewd, rip-snortingly vulgar and often hilarious — as he speaks into a tape recorder for the purpose of publishing a book.","What results is a hyperbolic, first-person report on a world whose lexicon involves all manner of stereotype and slur and whose concerns are more or less confined to food, drink, drugs, money, sex, digestive excretions and football. Often cited as among the funniest sports books ever written, it came in at No. 7 on Sports Illustrated’s 2002 list of the top 100 sports books of all time.","“I loved it,” David Halberstam wrote in The New York Times Book Review. “I read it aloud to my wife, who does not like football one bit, and she loved it. It is outrageous. It mocks contemporary American mores. It mocks Madison Avenue; it mocks racial attitudes; it mocks writers like me; and it even mocks sportswriters for Sports Illustrated like Dan Jenkins.”",“Semi-Tough” was adapted for a 1978 movie that starred Burt Reynolds as Billy Clyde Puckett.,"Dan Thomas Jenkins was born in Fort Worth on Dec. 2, 1928, although many sources list the year as 1929. His father, E. T. Jenkins Jr., known as Bud, was a salesman, a gambler and evidently a charmer who left the family when Dan was a toddler, though he showed up now and then to take his son to sporting events.","In a 2014 book, “His Ownself: A Semi-Memoir,” Mr. Jenkins expressed a fondness for his father, as well as for his mother, Catherine (O’Hern) Jenkins, whom he described with arch affection as a self-indulgent character who sold antiques and remodeled houses “and ultimately invented the migraine headache.”","From the age of 2, Mr. Jenkins grew up — contentedly, he wrote, in spite of the Depression — in the home of his father’s parents. He became the first member of the family to go to college, — at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, where he played on the golf team. One of his early heroes, the golfer Ben Hogan, also lived in Fort Worth, and Hogan became something of a mentor, admired by Mr. Jenkins for his work ethic, perseverance (Hogan returned to championship golf after nearly being killed in a car accident in 1949) and devotion to excellence.","Mr. Jenkins got his first job in journalism in the mid-1950s, at The Fort Worth Press, hired by Blackie Sherrod, a writer and editor who would himself become celebrated in Texas as a Southern Damon Runyon. Mr. Jenkins succeeded Sherrod, whom he cited as an influence, as sports editor before landing at Sports Illustrated.","Mr. Jenkins’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In 1959, he married June Burrage, whom he had known while growing up in Fort Worth. She survives him. In addition to his daughter, his survivors include his sons Marty and Dan Jr., a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter.","Mr. Jenkins plumbed the homey if earthy wisdom of Fort Worth in a number of books after “Semi-Tough,” including the novels “Dead Solid Perfect” (1974), about a professional golfer in the swaggering Billy Clyde mold, and “Baja Oklahoma” (1981), about a feisty waitress and single mother with aspirations to be a country singer; both became television movies.","Another novel, “You Gotta Play Hurt” (1991), a sendup of the sportswriter’s life, tells of a cantankerous Fort Worthian and the stuffy, big time magazine he works for. Mr. Jenkins wrote it after leaving Sports Illustrated in the 1980s in a dispute with the managing editor at the time, Gilbert Rogin.","He went on to write for Playboy and was a senior writer for Golf Digest, where in 2014 he created a squall with a parody of an interview with Tiger Woods in which he portrayed Mr. Woods as being arrogant and spoiled. In a response on The Players Tribune website, Mr. Woods called the article “a grudge-fueled piece of character assassination.”","“Journalistically and ethically,” he wrote, “can you sink any lower?”","Mr. Jenkins’s other books include “Limo,” a 1976 novel written with Bud Shrake, an old pal from Fort Worth who also wrote for Sports Illustrated; it satirizes network television by depicting the creation of a show that prefigures today’s reality programming.","None of Mr. Jenkins’s subsequent novels had the impact of his first. This was partly because the bawdy audacity that characterized “Semi-Tough” seemed less audacious in later books, and partly because the characters espousing the attitudes and employing the language favored by Billy Clyde and friends struck many readers as much less appealing as public attitudes changed.","Mr. Jenkins openly lamented this societal swivel. His characters spoke bitterly of it in his later novels, and his memoir, though full of vintage Jenkins phrase-turning and storytelling about the good old days of sports and sportswriting, is spiked with a sour loathing of what he called political correctness; the book, echoing the opening of “Semi-Tough,” contains some ill-humored and offensive remarks about Asians.","As the Times book critic Dwight Garner noted in his review of the memoir, “His anti-P.C. campaign is where his geezer routine crosses over into something worse.”","“Now this writer is going to be partly remembered for this stuff,” he added, “which is a shame.”","It’s a shame, Mr. Garner wrote, because of how generous Mr. Jenkins was.","“I woke up with a smile on my face every morning during the two or three days I spent reading ‘His Ownself,’ ” he wrote. The book, he said, is “one of those books that reminds you that good stories happen only to people who can tell them.”"
Using Sports Psychology for Childbirth - The New York Times,"Any woman who has ever carried and birthed a child, in whatever fashion, deserves her own ESPN highlight reel — blood, sweat, tears and the eventual triumph of holding her newborn baby. To be clear, childbirth isn’t a game. You can’t plead with the referee when you don’t like a call or leave the field when you’re tired. ","Still, as a lifelong athlete, I saw childbirth, especially an unmedicated one, as the ultimate challenge of physical endurance, mental stamina and my ability to handle pain.","When I became pregnant in January 2018 and set about preparing for the monumental task of birthing a human, I loaded up on prenatal vitamins, kept a daily routine of birthing stretches and exercises, and endured an eight-week birthing course. An image of the lead female competitors in the New York City Marathon, who bring me to tears when they run past my Brooklyn apartment each year, filled me with confidence for labor. Washboard-like abs. Lean legs showing off every strand of muscle. Calm, focused and confident expressions on their faces.","However, as my due date came near, I clung to a fear of pain and the unknowns out of my control. How long would my labor be? Would my mind fall apart? What if my pelvis wasn’t the optimal shape or I stopped dilating?",I wanted to face childbirth with the same kind of confidence that radiated from the runners I admired. So I turned to sports psychology for advice.,"The field typically uses a hodgepodge of methods like cognitive behavioral therapy and attention control training to improve athletic performance and competitor experience. It suits a laboring woman because it can quickly provide practical tools to achieve a specific goal, said Jay-Lee Nair, a Singapore-based sports psychologist who works with athletes, including professional golfers and Olympic sailors, as well as women preparing for labor. A simple strategy could be mimicking an athlete’s pregame routine like reciting affirmations “reminding them about their game plan or the attitude they want to have,” she said.","To help me labor like an Olympian, Dr. Nair challenged my unhelpful birth beliefs with rational facts. In the sports context, an unhelpful thought could be “believing a win in a tournament was because of luck or lesser skilled competitors,” she said.","I have a fear of operations and for me, undergoing a cesarean would take more guts than an unmedicated labor. Dr. Nair advised me to gather positive cesarean stories for a process called cognitive restructuring, in which fact-based alternative statements dispute the irrational belief. I was under the impression that a mother could not pick up her child for six weeks after a cesarean, but many of my friends assured me that they could within days.","“It is hard just like a natural birth is hard, and you’re still amazing for going through that,” Dr. Nair said.","Joan Steidinger, a sports psychologist based in the Bay Area and a former ultramarathon runner, told me to develop a mindfulness plan by identifying the extremely difficult moments in labor — the 45-minute cab ride to the hospital under the onslaught of contractions topped my list — and to design a predetermined meditation for each. She used this strategy when she prepared runners for the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run, in which the track goes through canyons with stagnant 110-degree air. “You might visualize a cool waterfall, something to take your mind off the situation,” said Dr. Steidinger.","I still wondered how athletes reframe their minds if something doesn’t go as planned mid-competition. How does a figure skater shift from aiming for gold to finishing her four-minute routine with dignity when she doesn’t land a jump that took months of practice? “What we usually do is create some kind of action they do to refocus because an action connects mind and body,” said Caroline Silby, a former figure skater turned sports psychologist. That could mean pushing down on the ice or drawing a deep breath to move beyond failure, Dr. Silby said.","The physical cue I developed to help me reframe mid-labor started with clenched fists during an inhale and then opening them during an exhale, with my palms up in a surrender. I would surrender to the difficult moments or to whatever my body needed for a safe birth, whether that was every intervention under the sun or nothing at all.","The idea of pain with a purpose is common in sports and labor. So are breathing techniques and visualizations to cope. Visualizations didn’t do it for me, but breathing did. During my birth class, I figured out what I liked — a long, loud exhale where I focused on the vibrating hum inside my mouth. I practiced this a few times each week while holding a piece of ice (it’s surprisingly painful). Dr. Silby added a tip: Stay present and enjoy the rest between contractions, much as a marathon runner turns a downhill section into active recovery. “If you’re anticipating the next painful push during recovery, that is a waste,” she said.","After an anxious and tearful 13 days beyond my due date, contractions started on a Monday evening. Labor quickly became a familiar rhythm, not unlike my favorite workout of high-intensity interval training where, say, a minute of squats is followed by a 20-second break.","By 3 a.m., my contractions were down to three minutes apart, our cue to head to the hospital. Excitement. Anticipation. And then my labor stalled. I used my physical cue — releasing clenched fists — again and again to move beyond the disappointment.","My mind held it together until around midday. Why did my stupid body slow the contractions? At the same physical and mental crossroads in a soccer match, I would have raised my hand for a substitution so a more energized teammate could finish what I started. But this was labor. I was the only one who could birth this baby.","After some bleeding at 2 p.m., my obstetrician advised me to come into the hospital. I assumed I had hours left and that beautiful thought “epidural” appeared on the horizon. However, my body had other ideas.","When I got in the cab, my contractions were 10 minutes apart. When I got out, the contractions were coming every two minutes and my water had broken (yes, in the cab). Minutes later I was in a labor room. I pushed, the obstetrician pulled, my doula held my leg back and my mom propped my head up. It was freeing to finally enlist some brute strength.","After almost 24 hours of labor, and half an hour of pushing, just 90 minutes after arriving at the hospital I had my slimy, alert and, at 9 pounds, 8 ounces, very large son.","The strategies borrowed from sports psychology got me somewhat gracefully through labor. But they are not foolproof. Like Serena Williams at this year’s United States Open final, even elite athletes have their trying moments. I did, too, just as I entered the homestretch of my labor.","Less than two weeks after the birth, I stood on the stoop to watch the New York City Marathon, holding my sleepy newborn. The lead women ran by at their cracking pace, elegant and forceful. A tunnel of spectators along the avenue celebrated them. As usual, I had tears in my eyes. But this year, I felt that I was in their elite league.",Serena Solomon is an Australian journalist based in New York.

Letters to the Sports Editor - The New York Times,To the Sports Editor: ,"Re “For Jackie Robinson’s Centennial, a Display of Rarely Seen Photographs,” Jan. 31: In my 80s now. The special section about Jackie Robinson is a forever treasure.","In my boyhood in Logansport, Ind., a childhood friend of my father’s was Johnny (Red) Corriden, who made the big leagues and was a Brooklyn Dodgers coach in the 1940s. At the end of the season, he would stop by our home in Logansport, and each visit Red would say, “Here Johnny” and present me with a brand-new official major league baseball.","This writer, only 7 when this started and 1,000 miles from Brooklyn, became a lifelong Dodgers fan. Along came 1946, and Robinson was at Montreal. Everything possible was read about him, and then came 1947. (Corriden by then was a Yankees coach.)","My local drugstore for some wild reason had a Jackie Robinson comic book for sale. With 10 cents from my allowance, I got the comic book and was reading it on the front porch when my father, a white man born in 1891, saw me with it and said, “Son, it’s all right that you root for that colored and all right that you read that comic book, but do not let anyone know about this.”","For a 10-year-old who believed that his parents were always right, there was stunning mystification. In the early spring of 1947, we rode the train to Chicago to see the Dodgers play the Cubs. We had good seats near the visitors’ dugout (somehow Corriden arranged this, even though he was with the Yankees).","As not everyone knows, Robinson played first base his rookie year. When he stepped out of the dugout, in the Dodgers’ traveling grays, and made his pigeon-toed trot to first base, all at once two things were known by me: My all-time sports hero was right before my eyes, and my father had feet of clay.","This watershed moment has affected my views about civility forever. On the 40th anniversary of Robinson’s rookie year, I sent a short note to Rachel Robinson, Jackie’s widow, simply stating that his heroism had reached and forever touched a 10-year-old a thousand miles away.",John F. Dunn,"Decatur, Ill.",To the Sports Editor:,"My fanatical loyalty to the distant Brooklyn Dodgers led to many fights and much peer mockery (as the Dodgers lost too many World Series) when I was 6 in a 1950 Larchmont, N.Y., neighborhood of Yankees fans.","Jackie Robinson, my hero, ran faster, hit more cannily, executed double plays and taunted opposition pitchers and infielders with greater skill, guts and swagger than anyone else in the game (to the best of my unstatistical knowledge). Stealing home, to my later Little Leaguer’s mind, was nearly impossible, but Robinson succeeded 20 times and attempted even more.","At first, I did not know his race. I did not understand such categories. He was just the greatest ballplayer. A little older, I knew better and learned that getting to first base was only one of the difficulties that faced my American hero (in every sense of that word).","So when “next year” became “this year” (some readers will understand that phrase), tears came to my eyes. When the Dodgers moved to L.A., it happened again. When Jackie Robinson died young, I wept. When I read The Times’s special section, once more I cried.",Donald Lateiner,"Delaware, Ohio",To the Sports Editor:,"As deserving as Jackie Robinson is of all the attention he has received, it is a shame that Larry Doby is all but ignored. Doby broke the color barrier in the American League two months after Robinson broke in with the Dodgers. He faced all the same difficulties as Robinson, overcame all the same hurdles and persevered to have a great career, helping Cleveland win the 1948 World Series. Yet we see no biopics or retrospectives of Doby. No. 42 has been retired from baseball, but No. 14 goes unhonored. Perhaps playing in New York is the reason for the difference. But whatever the reason, there is no doubt that Doby is in fact deserving of recognition to the same degree as Robinson.",Mark B. Cohn,"Naples, Fla."
Their News Isn’t New: Sports Anchors in the Era of Social Media - The New York Times,"Scott Van Pelt closed an episode of “SportsCenter” last month with a two-minute monologue about the 31st anniversary of his father’s death. Strengthened by two friends who had recently lost their parents, Van Pelt spoke passionately about running from grief, and encouraged everyone to do the opposite — to articulate their pain so they could overcome it.","The segment went viral. It embodied the essential traits of Van Pelt’s version of ESPN’s flagship show — sensitivity, nuance and the courage to be vulnerable — that help him connect with viewers.","“It’s a great reminder of the power of the microphone we hold in our hands,” Van Pelt said.","But that power is changing — disappearing, even — as television viewing habits change and sports media develop new ways to bring fans what they want when they want it. (Now!) That means what was once a premier placement in TV sports — the anchor desk — is not the high perch it used to be. It is not clear anymore what it is at all.","Not so long ago, sports fans operated on a schedule dictated by the programming that was available on TV. The sports highlight show, “SportsCenter” being the most popular one, was appointment viewing.","It was where sports fans went to see the highlights they could only read about in the newspaper. People came to know its anchors: Keith Olbermann, Linda Cohn, Stuart Scott, Robin Roberts, Dan Patrick, to name a few. They complemented the sports clips with their own personalities and, in the case of Scott, redefined the highlight show genre.","But today, highlights flood fans’ Twitter timelines immediately: a buzzer beater on loop seconds after it drops through the net; a touchdown from multiple angles before referees have ruled it good. They flood our Instagram feeds thanks to users like House of Highlights, which delivers the day’s most important sports highlights to more than 12 million followers.","“SportsCenter,” even with six editions each weekday, can no longer dangle the carrot of providing clips unavailable anywhere else. On most nights, when the highlight package rolls, Van Pelt is telling a majority of the viewers about something they have already seen.","“Every person covering sports is trying to figure out the riddle,” Van Pelt said. He asked how a program could deliver highlights “to you in a way that you will want it and convince yourself that you will need it.”","Omar Raja, 24, is the founder of House of Highlights. He grew up watching sports highlights on the local news with his father every morning. When Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006, he did not find out about it until he turned on his TV the next morning.","“It’s crazy to think 10 years ago, we had to wait until the next day to find out what happened the night before,” Raja said.","Raja’s team can now offer instant access to what everyone is talking about. But Raja thinks traditional and new-age highlights delivery systems can coexist. He still watches “SportsCenter,” after all, especially Van Pelt’s midnight edition.","“I don’t really listen to him for the highlights,” Raja said. “I just listen to him for his thoughts on things. He’s a good personality, and he’s charismatic.”","When Van Pelt took over as anchor in 2015, he said, he decided to lean on his personality and trust the audience to connect with his curiosity about sports.","Per ESPN, Van Pelt has consistently generated higher ratings among 18-to 34-year-old men in his midnight time slot than late-night talk shows on broadcast or cable. Other sports anchors have tried a similar approach, to lesser degrees of success.","Jay Onrait and Dan O’Toole’s show on Fox Sports went through several iterations before pivoting toward a late-night show format; it was canceled in 2017. Jemele Hill and Michael Smith were chosen to overhaul the 6 p.m. “SportsCenter,” but the reformatted show — called “SC6” or “The Six” — lasted a little more than a year before it was broken up in 2018. During its run, Hill was criticized for a post to her personal Twitter account about President Trump, and for another about the N.F.L., for which ESPN suspended her.","“To ignore the racial component and the climate that they faced would be completely dishonest,” Van Pelt said of Hill and Smith, who are African-American. “They faced challenges that I didn’t face. They also didn’t have the benefits that I have.”","Those benefits include a midnight slot that allows Van Pelt to experiment in front of a smaller potential audience, and stronger lead-ins from “Monday Night Football” during the N.F.L. season.","Onrait, who now hosts “Jay and Dan” on TSN in Canada at midnight, has adopted the sensibilities of a late-night talk-show host in this turn as a sports anchor.","“Personality is what’s going to rule the next phase of television,” Onrait said.","Others, such as Skip Bayless of Fox Sports, combine so-called “hot takes” with continuous criticism of high-profile athletes like LeBron James to connect with viewers.","“The only thing that really worked at Fox was Skip,” Onrait said. “Nothing was working until Skip showed up. No one got ratings. I know lots of people have made a living out of crapping on the guy, but what he did was bring actual viewers to the network. He was the only one who did that.”","In a statement to The New York Times, Norby Williamson, an ESPN executive who oversees “SportsCenter,” pushed back against the idea that the show is becoming obsolete.","“We recognize that people have many options for viewing highlights now, but we continue to develop presentations that you’re not going to see anywhere else,” Williamson said. “We’ll show you what happened but also how it happened and why.”","While ESPN still sees its network and the “SportsCenter” franchise as vital to the fan’s experience, what really matters is whether viewers will continue to see it this way.",Van Pelt knows that reckoning is coming soon.,"“I keep thinking to myself this is a short window,” Van Pelt said. “It won’t go on forever.”"
"E-Sports Embraces Traditional Training Methods: Less Pizza, More Yoga - The New York Times","COPENHAGEN — The squats and leg lifts were harder than they looked, and after a few sets, Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez placed his hands on his knees and attempted to compose himself.","In November, Aguirre, a 24-year-old professional video game player from Spain, joined the five-man roster of Origen, a League of Legends team that competes in the game’s top European league. The players — all signed in late fall — were told at the time that the team might be run a bit differently from what they were accustomed to. Now here they were, five young men who make their living sitting almost completely still in front of desktop computers, sweating through an hourlong workout in a cramped gym.","“I think I’m going to puke my oatmeal,” said Aguirre, who is known in the gaming community as Mithy. “I’m dying.”","Some years ago, traditional sports leagues were revolutionized by young analysts wielding computers. The way things had always been done, it turned out, was not always the best way to do things. Now echoes of that transformation have arrived in the growing world of professional e-sports, where gamers are being shepherded toward a new frontier, oddly, by the old, corporeal wisdom of traditional sports.","The debate about whether competitive gamers can be considered athletes may never end. In the meantime, though, gamers are increasingly acting like them.","Origen is one of two teams owned by Rfrsh Entertainment, an e-sports company based in Copenhagen. Two years ago, the organization hired Kasper Hvidt, a former captain of Denmark’s national handball team, to be its sporting director. Hvidt, 43, had no previous exposure to gaming. But that was the point.","E-sports in recent years have crept into the mainstream, attracting new fans, new sponsors and new investment. The top professionals now make six-figure salaries and earn even more with endorsements and prize money. And yet, Hvidt observed, their approach to performance remained amateurish.","Eating right, sleeping right, exercising, cleaning up for sponsors — these ideas have undergirded traditional sports for generations. In e-sports, they are regarded as almost radical.","“They don’t look at themselves as physical human beings,” said Hvidt, who won the European handball championship with Denmark in 2008.","“It’s common sense, in a way. But with them it was not.”","Rfrsh has a validating narrative under its belt. The company’s other team, Astralis, which competes internationally in the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had gone almost a year without winning a tournament when Hvidt joined the organization in mid-2017. In 2018, the team earned $3.7 million in prize money while putting together one of the most dominant years ever by any team in any e-sports game.","And so Origen this year has set off on the same journey of athletic self-improvement. As recently as last year, the players’ typical day might have been a sedentary extravaganza of sugary energy drinks, fast food and unresolved psychic tension. Now, their days are interposed with protein smoothies, yoga mats and slow-paced breathing exercises.","The effects of those changes, the team said, have been plain to see: After starting the current season with a 1-4 record, Origen went on a tear, winning 11 of its final 13 matches, finishing the regular season in second place and securing a first-round bye for the playoffs, which began Friday.","“These are little things,” Fabian Broich, Origen’s assistant coach, said. “But they add up, and over the long term you have a more emotionally stable team and a more focused team.”","At Rfrsh, Hvidt has assembled a performance team — a physical trainer, a sports psychologist, a massage therapist, a medical doctor and a nutritionist — and constructed a lifestyle plan for the players that combines scientific research, old-school sports wisdom and simple common sense. Broich, 28, a former professional soccer player from Germany, acts as a liaison between the management team and the players, implementing the principles on the ground.","The players, who hail from five European countries and range in age from 18 to 24, live in Denmark and fly each weekend to Berlin, where the League of Legends matches are taped in front of a boisterous studio audience. In Copenhagen, they are required to get around by bicycle (a rule they all hated at first) and have fitness and yoga classes during the week. On Mondays, they meet with the team psychologist for an “empty-the-backpack” session.","Every morning, the team meets for breakfast in Broich’s apartment, a ritual designed in part to get the gamers — night owls and notoriously late risers — out of bed at a reasonable hour. Their other meals are catered with guidance from the nutritionist.","“Before, I would go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. the next day, eat McDonald’s two times, and that’d be it,” Patrik Jiru, 18, an Origen player from the Czech Republic, said as he ate a salmon and vegetable omelet one recent morning.","After breakfast, the players biked to the gym for a core workout and a physical therapy session.","“Last time we did this, my body was sore for three days,” Jonas Andersen, 24, an Origen player from Denmark known as Kold, said as he grabbed a medicine ball.","Mikkel Hjuler, a trainer who works with Danish Olympians, guided the team through some gaming-specific exercises. He had the players wrap their fists inside elastic bands and flex their fingers. He taught them a neck exercise favored by boxers.","The players were willing participants, but they admitted that their ambitions, from a physical standpoint, were modest.","“I’m O.K. with being chubby as long as I don’t pass out when I’m running — which, right now, I might,” Aguirre said.","The players continue to train several hours a day in front of computers, but even those sessions now borrow elements from traditional sports.","Before a recent scrimmage session at the Rfrsh headquarters, Broich distributed magnesium pills and protein bars. (He keeps vitamin D and krill oil in his arsenal, too.) Later, he blended a potpourri of nutritional supplements — moringa, matcha, maca, chlorella, açaí and a half-dozen others — into a thick protein shake.","In their meeting room, a quotation attributed to the N.B.A. coach Phil Jackson — “The strength of the team is each individual member” — was scribbled on a dry-erase board. After one practice game, the team laid out yoga mats and stretched on foam rollers.","Trevor Henry, 31, a broadcast commentator for Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, marveled at how quickly the game’s competitive landscape was professionalizing. He was happy, for instance, that some teams were reconsidering their use of gaming houses, a classic e-sports setup in which players live and train together under one roof.","“Go back just a few years: Professional players would play 10 to 11 hours every day and do takeout food every day,” Henry said. “Pizza boxes would stack up rooms. Laundry would never get done. I’ll be brutally honest: Teams didn’t wash the team shirts. They’d have the same team shirt that they’d wear 24 weeks in a year that has never seen detergent.”","This lifestyle — part monk, part fraternity brother — was not only accepted but also held up as the very reason the players were successful. But that wisdom is now being challenged, and in Europe the shift by League of Legends this year to a 10-team, franchise model (akin to American sports leagues) has encouraged organizations to make more long-term investments.","Last year, Fabien Devide, the chairman of Team Vitality, a French gaming organization, spent seven months embedded in his League of Legends team’s gaming house in Berlin. He was startled by what he saw.","“It was a madhouse,” Devide said, describing an atmosphere with an utter lack of boundaries between personal and professional life. “It can become a toxic environment very quick.”","Devide said Team Vitality planned to move its players into separate apartments later this year. Acknowledging the pioneering example of Rfrsh, he said he was formalizing plans to open a training center for his organization in Paris and hire a performance director, in the mold of Hvidt, to devise a program grounded in traditional sports ideas.","Teams now understand that championships are won and lost in the details. When Origen was assembling its squad last year, Hvidt asked potential signees to complete a personality test with hundreds of questions to make sure it was building an emotionally compatible group.","In December, the players convened for a preseason camp with one catch: no computers. Instead, the players spent several days completing trust exercises and discussing their dreams with Lars Robl, a sports psychologist who spent two decades in the Danish special forces — “the real Counter Strike,” he joked — and whose other clients include the Danish soccer club F.C. Midtjylland.","Robl’s job now is to help the gamers see themselves as elite athletes, just like the soccer players.","“They have the same DNA,” Robl said. “They’re just not aware of it yet.”"
"From a Church in Philadelphia, Sports Reference Informs the World - The New York Times","PHILADELPHIA — While writing a sermon in September, Cheryl Pyrch, the pastor of Summit Presbyterian Church, needed an assist. On the topic of greatness and Jesus Christ, she wanted to open with recollections of greats in other spheres.",She didn’t have to look very far for a source.,"Having encountered Wilt Chamberlain in passing almost 40 years ago, she decided he was the great she wanted to highlight. And details of his career — four Most Valuable Player Awards, seven N.B.A. scoring titles — were close at hand, literally and figuratively through Sports Reference, a monolith of sports data websites that just happens to rent space from the church.","“I didn’t know all this in 1980,” Pyrch told the congregation as she described Chamberlain’s awards during the Sunday service. “I got it yesterday from a Sports Reference website.”","The ubiquitous Sports Reference family of websites — Baseball-Reference.com, Basketball-Reference.com, Pro-Football-Reference.com, Hockey-Reference.com, and so on — are some of the most popular sports almanacs on the internet.","They draw users of all kinds, from people casually searching for a trivia answer to owners of professional teams. Aided by an overhaul of its mobile website, Sports Reference’s founder and president, Sean Forman, said the group of sites drew one billion page views last year, a record for the company.","Sports Reference, however, does not have the gleaming offices or huge staff of a digital titan. It has 11 full-time employees and is headquartered on the third floor of a building at Summit Presbyterian in Philadelphia, behind the 100-year-old main church and above the gymnasium, which is often used as a day care center.","“Walking through it to come in and out, sometimes you’re going through 3-year-olds tossing balls,” said Mike Kania, 38, who eight years ago became one of the company’s first employees. “I worked for AOL for a long time where we had a badge to scan at the front door, people there and a front desk. It’s a lot different from that.”","It is, in fact, a point of pride among Sports Reference employees that the sites have grown from humble beginnings into oft-used resources. Until late last year, Forman, 47, was cleaning the office and taking out the trash. (He has since hired the church’s janitor to take over those duties.)","They are among the most popular sports-related sites. Basketball-Reference trails only NBA.com, while Pro-Football-Reference is second to NFL.com, according to SimilarWeb. Nearly two decades after Forman created Baseball-Reference, it ranks third among baseball sites, behind MLB.com and MLBTradeRumors.com. (Baseball-Reference, however, is the top draw in Forman’s stable.)","The sites are not just for casual fans. J.J. Redick, the Philadelphia 76ers guard, pays for an advertising-free Basketball-Reference subscription. John Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C., uses Baseball-Reference’s Play Index to manage statistical searches. Scott Boras, the well-known baseball agent, donated $100 to the company during its infancy because he had relied on the site’s data while negotiating a contract for Andruw Jones, Forman said.","“I use it daily,” said Thad Levine, the Minnesota Twins general manager, although his team, like many others, generates its own advanced and proprietary data.","“We went so far as to hire one of their back-end programmers,” added Levine, referring to Hans Van Slooten, who oversaw Baseball-Reference until June, when the Twins hired him for their front office.","The sites are still expanding and developing. Forman said he envisioned Basketball-Reference eventually surpassing Baseball-Reference in traffic as a result of the data revolution in the N.B.A. And over the summer, Sports Reference began another major undertaking: a soccer website, FBref.com, which the company hopes will be as comprehensive as its other sites. In a twist from its current offerings, the company is planning to make the soccer site bilingual, with English and Spanish versions.","The sites are painstakingly tweaked for updates and corrections. Some errors are reported through the dozens of emails the company receives daily. One came from the mother of Casey Fossum, a former major league pitcher. She wrote to say that her son’s birth date was wrong. It was corrected.",Other requests reveal the reach of Sports Reference.,A pitching coach sent an email asking that his Italian league statistics be added to his page so that his players would stop teasing him about being a bad pitcher. A woman wrote in to say that she was dating a person who claimed to be a former N.F.L. player but that she could not find him on Pro-Football-Reference. She wanted to know if that was because of an oversight or a lie.,"“I tried to let her down as gently as possible,” said Mike Lynch, 37, whose official title with the company is managing stathead. “I said something like, ‘If he was cut in training camp, we wouldn’t necessarily have a record of him playing in a regular season game.’”","Sports Reference started with Baseball-Reference in 2000, when Forman, looking to avoid work on his doctoral dissertation on applied mathematical and computational sciences at the University of Iowa, began building a website from the CD-ROM that accompanied the printed Total Baseball encyclopedias. He hoped to make historical data more accessible.","Forman, who has contributed to The New York Times’s baseball coverage in the past, expanded his endeavor by creating Sports Reference in 2004. Three years later he formalized loose affiliations with Pro-Football-Reference (founded by Doug Drinen in 2000) and Basketball-Reference (founded by Justin Kubatko in 2004). Kubatko left Sports Reference in 2013 because of what he called “creative differences.”","In 2007, Forman still fit the stats nerd stereotype, working out of the basement of his home and staying up until 1 a.m. updating or improving the website. The year before, he had left his full-time job of six years — professor of mathematics and computer science at St. Joseph’s University — because it was too hard to juggle both. He also needed a better place to work.","So Forman turned to his church, which had space to rent.","Sports Reference’s seven websites are usually updated automatically, mostly from official feeds of statistics that the company pays for. Some data, such as roster transactions or salary information, is input manually, and there are always bugs to fix.","Once you get beyond the basics, however, the information on the sites runs the gamut of sources.","They include a collection of old college media guides acquired from a single collector and a professor in Britain who supplies statistics of independent baseball leagues. The sites also add some things just for fun, such as Oddibe McDowell’s page listing his utility bills from 2011 and part of 2012, in reference to a series of articles by Deadspin.","Sports Reference’s goal is to become more comprehensive, even as sports leagues increasingly privatize their data. Eventually, the company hopes to charge for advanced features and to become less dependent on advertising, which currently generates 95 percent of the sites’ revenue. As of now, the only advanced tool that requires a paid subscription is Baseball-Reference’s Play Index. (Don’t worry: The page for the former Met Keith Hernandez’s mustache will live forever.)","That the little company in her church has become so important, with leading sports websites, earned a laugh from Pyrch. She had been to the sites once or twice, including the time she did sermon research.","“I think that both myself and most of the congregation would not realize what kind of a powerhouse Sports Reference is,” she said. “I don’t really know a lot about numbers or computers, but one billion is a lot.”"
Playing to Win: Using Sports to Develop Evidence-Based Arguments - The New York Times,"Sports is not just about X’s and O’s or wins and losses; it’s also about ethics and economics, race and gender, science and technology, joy and camaraderie, and nearly everything in between. Sports allows us to admire the awesomeness of the human body and the artistry of athletes in action, and to explore stories of grit and resilience and our need for heroes and villains.","While it might not be immediately obvious to all teachers, particularly those who aren’t die-hard fans, sports is also an endless source of inspiration for making arguments and throwing down facts.","In this lesson, we explore how to use the world of sports to help students effectively develop evidence-based arguments. We suggest three categories for practicing the skill in sports contexts — from making a case for the G.O.A.T. to taking on current sports-world controversies to proposing rule changes to make a sport or tournament better. We end the lesson with a few strategies for bringing debate and argument writing alive in the classroom.",Do you teach with sports reporting? We’d love to hear your ideas. Post a comment or write to LNFeedback@nytimes.com.,_________,Who is the G.O.A.T.?,"No, not those cute animals with the horns and the beard. The Greatest of All Time.","No matter how seemingly impossible it is to determine the G.O.A.T., it is a perennial favorite argument for sports fans and is debated regularly in The New York Times.","The G.O.A.T. argument comes in many forms: Best Game, Best Season, Best Coach, Best Team, Greatest Upset, Greatest Olympian. Even best and worst sports cities.",But how do you decide: Is it the accomplishments on the playing field or is it a player’s greater impact beyond his or her sport? How do you compare one era to another?,"Is Tom Brady the greatest football player of all time? Who would you pick, Michael Jordan or LeBron James? Is Serena Williams the greatest athlete of all time? Or is it Muhammad Ali?","Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the Munich Olympics in 1936, broke or equaled nine Olympic records, also set three world records and single-handedly shattered Adolf Hitler’s myth of Aryan superiority; yet his record mark of 10.3 seconds in the 100 meters would today be 21 feet behind Usain Bolt’s record of 9.58. Would it be more fair to incorporate broader cultural accomplishments? Or should the Greatest of All Time focus solely on the numbers?",Student Challenge: Make your case for the G.O.A.T.,"First, ask your students to decide which aspect of the G.O.A.T. debate they would like to tackle: greatest play, season, game, coach, athlete, et cetera.","Next, they should define their criteria for greatness: Does greatest mean the player you want to be up at bat in the seventh game of the World Series, two outs in the bottom of the ninth? Is it instead the number of an athlete’s victories? His or her longevity? The relative strength of the competition? The athlete’s impact within, as well as beyond, the sport?",Advance Evidence-Based Arguments and Tackle Counterarguments ,"Use a model text or two to help students move from mere assertion or opinion to rigorous, evidence-based argument. Here are a few excerpts to highlight how authors both support claims with evidence and anticipate counterarguments:","In “Is Russell Westbrook’s Season the Best Ever? Some Apples and Oranges to Pick From,” Jeré Longman supports his claims with evidence using sports statistics:","In “It’s Time to Appreciate Serena Williams’s Greatness,” Christopher Clarey anticipates counterarguments:","Together, the class might analyze how these authors develop their case for G.O.A.T., for example, by defining their terms for greatness, providing evidence to support claims and anticipating and then considering potential counterclaims.","Here are additional resources, from The Times, and elsewhere, that can provide alternative mentor texts:","The Fine Line: What Makes Simone Biles the World’s Best Gymnast Eliud Kipchoge Is the Greatest Marathoner, Ever On Team of All-Time Greats, Pelé Shines Brightest Golden State Warriors Are Closing In on History Lindsey Vonn to Retire: Vonn Leaves as the Greatest Women’s Skier in History G.O.A.T.

To some, Jesse Owens will always be the G.O.A.T. for his cultural impact; for others, Bill Russell’s 11 N.B.A. championships will trump all other measures. But that is the beauty of the debate. And in the end, it’s about the power of the argument to persuade others — at least for that day — who is the Greatest of All Time.",_________,Should athletes who use steroids be barred from professional sports? Should players have the right to kneel during the national anthem? Should college athletes be paid?,These are just a few of the countless debates that come and go in the world of sports. Any one of them is ripe for students to investigate and debate to practice their inquiry and argument skills.,"In this section we present three sports-related case studies to demonstrate how students can develop good research questions, assert a strong claim and study mentor texts as a way to improve their debate writing and speaking skills. And these three topics are just the tip of the iceberg; at the end of the section, we suggest another 11 current issues in sports for students to explore. And we’re confident your students would have plenty more topics to add to our list.",Case Study #1. Sports and Concussions,"Sports are often associated with heroism — endurance, toughness, and valor. It has long been assumed that an athlete will have to make physical sacrifices to achieve greatness. But the sacrifice is now being questioned because of changes in our understanding of the impact sports can have on our bodies and minds.","The brain trauma sustained in football and other contact sports is now linked to long-term cognitive impairment, including memory loss, confusion, depression and dementia. Although media coverage of concussions has focused on tackle football, these health issues are evident in many other sports like hockey, soccer, basketball, Nascar, skiing, snowboarding and BMX freestyle, among others.",The debate is not merely academic; it is causing significant changes to our understanding of athletes and athletics and is threatening the future viability of some of the world’s most popular sports.,Develop Winning Questions,Research generally begins with asking good questions. Even a topic as seemingly straight forward as sports-related concussions has many layers of complexity. So students should begin their research by asking themselves: What about this topic interests me most? What do I want to learn more about?,"For example, if they want to start with the science, they might generate questions like: What is the impact of a single concussion? What is the long-term impact of brain trauma? What is the degenerative brain disease C.T.E.? And what is the impact of concussions on youths?","Or they may instead decide to investigate the role equipment plays, look into possible reforms or consider ethical implications. If they decide to go in any of these directions, they might come up with questions like: How do concussions affect athletes’ short- and long-term physical and mental health? How does this affect the people around them? What is the role of equipment in brain trauma? Can equipment reduce concussions or does it give players a false sense of security, therefore making the problem worse? Should parents let their children play football? Or are we obsessing about the dangers? Should we as fans still watch football?","No matter what question or questions students start with, research inevitably leads to asking more questions.",Some other relevant resources: ,"110 N.F.L.

National Anthem Protests,"Political activism and protests by athletes are nothing new. Muhammad Ali publicly criticized the Vietnam War. John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised fists during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics. Following the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the other members of the Miami Heat posted a photo of themselves wearing hooded sweatshirts in his memory. But perhaps no act of political protest today is more polarizing than the stance by Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem at N.F.L. games.","If students want to argue a position related to recent national anthem protests, they should start by asking a question. For example, should athletes have the right to kneel during the national anthem? Or are athletes who protest being patriotic or unpatriotic? As students do research, they will gather evidence that will support a position. Once they find enough compelling evidence, they are ready to assert a claim (or thesis or resolution).",Assert a Claim ,"In small groups or as a whole class, students can debate one or more claims that were generated by students — or the teacher. After they have the opportunity to test their arguments with their peers and hear other points of view, they can write up their argument as an essay or editorial.","Below are a few possible resolutions that students can affirm or negate, with related articles below.",Resolution 1: The N.F.L. has the right to demand that its players stand during the national anthem.,Surprise!

Performance-Enhancing Drugs,"Cheating has always existed in sports: spitballs in baseball; weighted gloves in boxing; stealing another team’s signs. Players are always looking for an edge, but perhaps none is more contentious and troubling than the edge that performance-enhancing drugs provide — steroids, human growth hormone, blood doping.","Some of sports’ most celebrated athletes have been caught using PEDs: for example, the cyclist Lance Armstrong, the gold-medal runner Marion Jones, the tennis champion Maria Sharapova and the Ultimate Fighting Championship star Jon Jones. In 2018, the entire Russian Winter Olympic team was barred from competing for doping violations.","Let’s say students have already generated their research questions related to the topic of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, they have done initial research, and they have asserted a claim they plan to defend in writing.

"For the Wealthy, Sports Opened a Back Door to Elite Colleges - The New York Times","The corruptions of American college sports and the status anxieties of the wealthy have achieved a spectacular commingling, as a federal indictment on Tuesday charged that N.C.A.A. coaches were paid to fix admissions for rich children at elite colleges and universities, like Georgetown, Yale and U.S.C.","An entrepreneur devised this ingenious scam less than a decade ago, and it involved multiple fixes, a sort of corruption minuet. Parents with cash to burn could pay to have a test taker sit in on the SAT or ACT in place of their teenagers. And if their children’s grades too were not up to snuff, they could bribe coaches to accept them as fake tennis, soccer and water polo prodigies.","The entry price for bribes often ran toward figures that meant this was no scheme for hoi polloi tennis dads. The bribe paying parents were weighted toward well-known actors, financiers and high-end designers. The ringleaders offered an additional service: If parents paid yet more money they could make children believe their test scores were real.","[Read more about the actresses, business leaders and other wealthy parents charged in the college admissions scandal.] ","So the Henriquez family (Manuel, the father, is chairman and chief executive of a publicly traded finance company) conspired to fix their daughter’s SAT, according to federal documents specifying the charges. Then, as the family had its gaze fixed on Georgetown University, they conspired with Gordon Ernst, the school’s tennis coach, to palm off their daughter as a tennis player.","She was helped to put together an application that was long on tales of struggle. I’ve played all summer. I grind out three and four hour a day workouts. I have a top 50 ranking in the USTA Junior Girls Tennis, and I’m looking forward to being part of the team and so on and on, and all of it was fabricated. At the end, the college coach simply told the admissions office: “Potential spot.”","Over the following year, the Henriquez Family Trust donated $400,000 to a foundation that in turn paid Ernst $950,000 for handling the Henriquez daughter and several other faux tennis recruits.",This is splendid work if your olfactory senses are not troubled by the stench of corruption.,"This scandal has had the salutary effect too of exploding what remains of upper middle class and wealthy self-righteousness about the grubby ways of the college sports in the basketball and football divisions. A year and a half back, F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors arrested assistant coaches and sneaker company fixers and pointed the finger at A.A.U. coaches and coaches who made payments to star players.","This, we were told, was unacceptable, a corruption that must be stamped out.","Unacceptable in this context meant, I suppose, a working class family and their son accepting $55,000 from an assistant coach at a large university that stands to make millions of dollars marketing their son while legally paying him nothing.","The wealthy already engage in much so-called acceptable board-tilting. Rich families routinely make contributions of millions of dollars to elite colleges in hopes of ensuring that admissions offices welcomed their children’s applications. More recently, as this scandal makes clear, families tried to ensure that their sons and daughters would be psychologically evaluated in such a way that allowed them to receive many extra hours to complete high pressure admissions tests to high school and college. It was the genius of this scandal’s mastermind that he found a way to combine that dodge with a subterfuge that allowed ringers to actually take those tests.","“Most of these kids don’t even have issues, but they’re getting time,” the ringleader explained to a parent. “The playing field is not fair.”","The F.B.I. transcript revealed no parent who protested this accounting. Let’s read the transcript as Gordon R. Caplan, co-chairman of the top law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, talks of fixing his teenager’s test scores.","“It’s just, to be honest, I’m not worried about the moral issue here,” he said.","This scandal is intriguing for a final reason. There is much gnashing and grinding of teeth these days over admission to elite schools, ranging from preferential admissions for black and Latino students to whether Asian-American students constitute a too large part of the student body.","This scandal reminds us that well-to-do families have long known of a back door. As the writer Saahil Desai pointed out in a fine piece for Atlantic Magazine last autumn, sports at elite colleges, from sailing to golf, tennis to lacrosse, are disproportionately filled with the children of the white wealthy. Many of these sports require that families spend upward of $1,000 per month during high school. Some 65 percent of the Ivy League athletes are white, and as the writer noted, this already constitutes a “quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids.”","These particular corrupt families used these doors to illegally gain entry for their well-privileged children. That is wrong, but it points to another way in which even well meaning wealthy parents can game the system.","“These parents are a catalog of wealth and privilege,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said Tuesday. “This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions.”","For once, he might have added, the coaches are but corrupt handmaids."
Retailer on Military Bases Says TV News Is Too ‘Divisive.’ Its Suggestion? Tune to Sports. - The New York Times,"In this era of political division, which cable news network you watch can reveal a lot about your political preferences.","For Republicans, it’s Fox News. For Democrats, it’s CNN or MSNBC.","But for a major retailer that serves the military, it’s simple: Don’t get involved.","The retailer, the Army & Air Force Exchange Service, which operates general and convenience stores and food courts on military bases in 34 countries, emailed locations this week recommending that they move away from playing news on public televisions and instead show a less partisan alternative: sports.","“As a federal entity, we remain neutral on political issues,” the message said. “News channels should not be shown on common area TVs due to their divisive political nature.”","In a second message to stores this week, the retailer removed its comments about news and politics but continued to suggest that televisions be tuned to sports. “This guidance allows flexibility to make adjustments based on the ‘news of the day’ and local needs,” it said.",Stars and Stripes reported news of the first message on Wednesday.,"The Army & Air Force Exchange Service, which is part of the Department of Defense and one of the largest retailers in the country, is the latest group to try to tiptoe around the question of what to do with televisions in shared spaces, at a time when partisan identification has grown to be one of the biggest wedges in America.","In recent years, people have complained about Fox News playing in doctors’ offices and hospitals, leading one waiting room in California to block the network temporarily. Dozens of airports across the country show CNN to the chagrin of those who see the network as biased. Thousands of people signed an online petition to “remove CNN’s airport monopoly.”","One fitness chain decided it was best to get rid of cable news entirely. The chain, Life Time, a Minnesota-based gym with locations across the country, removed cable news — both left- and right-leaning stations, including CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — from the large-screen televisions in its gyms last year as part of its commitment to a “healthy way of life.”","T. Franklin Waddell, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Florida, said that people tend to make assumptions about overall public opinion based on which news network is shown on public televisions.","“If you walk into a store or a restaurant and all the televisions are tuned to Fox News, you might make assumptions about the climate of public opinion and that can affect how likely you are to express your own political opinions,” he said.","“Those might be issues we can sidestep entirely if something more neutral was put on,” he added.","Chris Ward, a spokesman for Army & Air Force Exchange Service, said the emails this week were a general reminder, not a new policy, and were not prompted by any particular incident.","“We, of course, periodically do get complaints from customers,” he said. “If they are a CNN person, they don’t want it on Fox. If they are a Fox person, they don’t want it on CNN.”","The recommendation to turn to sports in food courts and other commons areas, he said, was a way to “appeal to the masses,” but he said it was just that: a recommendation.","“It’s not a hard and fast policy,” he said. “No one is going to get their hands slapped if they put the news on. It was more just guidance, like, hey, when in doubt, you can’t really go wrong with sports.”"

Opinion | Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports - The New York Times,"When the Duke University basketball star Zion Williamson injured his knee in a freak accident in a game on Wednesday, it reignited a debate over whether student-athletes competing as amateurs on college campuses should instead become paid professionals. If Williamson and other elite players like him are going to risk their professional futures by playing college sports, many wonder, shouldn’t they be financially compensated?","Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn’t afford. ","The 30 largest universities in the country each routinely generate annual revenues exceeding $100 million from sports, but according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, most of those revenues are spent covering operating expenses for the school’s athletic programs and paying tuition for their student-athletes. The majority of Division I colleges in the N.C.A.A. operate at a loss. In fact, among the roughly 350 athletic departments in the N.C.A.A.’s Division I, only about 24 schools have generated more revenue than expenses in recent years. The nation’s top five conferences made over $6 billion in 2015, billions more than all other schools combined, according to an ESPN analysis of N.C.A.A. data.","For the have-not universities, however, to continue operating means relying on millions of dollars in debt, funding from their main campus and student fees. Even with that help, some of the major athletic departments are struggling. A recent N.C.A.A. study determined that only about 20 of the 1,000 or so college sports programs in the nation were profitable. What is going to happen when the competition to offer students money is supercharged?","A federal judge in Northern California, Claudia Wilken, will soon decide if student-athletes should instead be paid more like professionals. At the moment, thanks in part to the pressure exerted by a 2015 ruling by Judge Wilken, top N.C.A.A. athletes can receive scholarships totaling tens of thousands of dollars for tuition, room, board and stipends, as well as cost-of-attendance compensation. But the association still sets a ceiling on those benefits, and a group of Division I basketball and football players is awaiting Judge Wilken’s ruling on whether that ceiling should effectively be lifted.","If the plaintiffs in this case are successful, the arms race for top athletes may have no limit. The top 25 or so schools will pay because they can afford to. The remaining 325 or so will be forced to make a decision: not pay their athletes (and risk losing top talent to schools that do) or find a way to pay.","We have already had a preview of what happens when schools are put in this position. In August 2015, after the N.C.A.A. began allowing Division I universities to adopt “cost of attendance” stipends, North Dakota State University announced that it would offer such stipends in 16 sports, resulting in a new $600,000 annual expense to be paid by the athletic department. The school’s rival, the University of North Dakota, followed suit six days later. What happened? The University of North Dakota cut five teams over the next two years to help pay for the added expense.","The University of Wyoming, too, announced that it would offer stipends to its student-athletes in 2015, resulting in a new expected annual cost of $700,000 to the athletic department. A year later, calls were being made for a reduction in the athletic department because of budgetary concerns. (Those cuts almost certainly would have been made, had it not been for a $4 million subsidy from the state government.)","Gene Smith, the athletic director at Ohio State University, has said that if the N.C.A.A. pay ceiling were lifted and he were pushed to pay basketball and football student-athletes more than their full-ride scholarship packages, he would not expect to maintain the same number of sports. The chancellor at the University of Wisconsin, Rebecca Blank, has also said that her school would consider cutting sports programs altogether.",Forcing the N.C.A.A. to pay student-athletes would undermine opportunities for the vast majority of them. It would create a winner-take-all system in which only a handful of top recruits would get a paycheck on top of earning a diploma debt-free.,"Similar problems would arise in the case of so-called third-party payments, in which student-athletes could be paid for things like endorsements. Major brands like Nike would pay top football and basketball talent at the biggest schools, while student-athletes in other sports or at smaller programs would be ignored. Currently, corporate funds go to athletic departments and are generally distributed among all sports; with third-party payments, those funds could instead mostly go directly to a few student-athletes, starving the rest.","I am not opposed to young athletes who decide they would prefer to be paid cash to play sports. For those who think that a free education is insufficient as compensation for playing sports, there are other options: The National Basketball Association’s developmental league, for instance, offers $125,000 contracts to top high-school talent. Such athletes can also pursue a career playing for other domestic or overseas professional leagues.","Millions of student-athletes devote their sweat, blood and tears to sports. Some play football and basketball; others swim, run cross-country, play soccer or compete as gymnasts. Only a fraction of them generate money for their schools. We must ensure that the N.C.A.A. is able to preserve its commitment to all of them."
"Besides the Mets, Other Astonishing Sports Runs - The New York Times",The 1969 Mets are regularly prefixed with the alliterative nickname Miracle.,But that doesn’t mean their unlikely World Series championship was the only astonishing run in sporting history. Plenty of other teams and athletes have defied the odds and the prognosticators to roar to unlikely triumph.,"In paying tribute to them, we’ll pass over the underdogs who were most known for beating the unbeatable: Rulon Gardner stunning Alexander Karelin, the United States Olympic hockey team topping the Soviets, Buster Douglas knocking out Mike Tyson, the aptly named Upset dealing Man o’ War his only loss.","Instead, we’ll look at the teams and athletes who came out of nowhere, the longest of the long shots. The Miracles.","Before the Miracle Mets of Shea Stadium, there were the Miracle Braves of Fenway Park in Boston. And their stories were uncannily similar.","Two years before, like the Mets, the Boston Braves were awful, going 52-101. Again, like the Mets, they improved some the next year, to 69-82. And in their shocking championship year they were 94-59 for an unexpected .614 winning percentage. The Mets were .617. Finally, like the Mets, they won the World Series.","In one way, their miracle outdid the Mets. By July 4, the Mets had established themselves at least as a decent team; they were 42-34, eight games out in the National League East.","Not the Braves. By July 4, 1914, they were 26-38, eighth out of eight in the National League. Somehow, they went 68-21 the rest of the way, a mind-boggling .764 clip, and won the league by 10½ games. Then they swept the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series.","In the pre-Ruthian era, the Braves were led by nine homers from Joe Connolly, and the good eye of 32-year-old Johnny Evers, of Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance fame, in his first year away from the Cubs.","The New York Times said: The “makeshift team, compactly welded together with a unity of purpose and a perfect harmony of action, had triumphed over one of the greatest ball clubs the game has known.”","Before the men’s 10,000 meters at the 1964 Olympics, the world-record holder Ron Clarke of Australia and the defending champion Pyotr Bolotnikov of the Soviet Union were attracting attention. Not attracting attention was Billy Mills of the United States. In the days before the race, no reporter asked him a single question, according to the Olympic historian David Wallechinsky.","But with a lap to go, Mills was right there. The leaders had to wind their way through a mass of lapped runners. Clarke, finding himself boxed in, shoved Mills out of the way. Then the Tunisian Mohamed Gammoudi pushed through as well. Mills looked to be running for a bronze. The announcer Bud Palmer speculated about an American record. No one was thinking gold.","But then Mills came tearing up on the outside. He passed Clarke. He closed on Gammoudi. “Look at Mills! Look at Mills!” hollered the color man, Dick Bank. (Bank later said he was fired by NBC for that outburst, which they considered unprofessional.)","Mills won in 28 minutes 24.4 seconds. He had never run under 29 minutes before. An official of the Tokyo Games approached him after the win to ask, “Who are you?”","The Times wrote: “Mills, who is part Sioux Indian and 100 percent American Marine, won a race that no one except himself and Mrs. Mills, who was in the stands, thought he had a chance to win.”","Many cite Boris Becker, who won Wimbledon as an unseeded 17-year-old in 1985, as the most unlikely Grand Slam champion. But not everyone was taken by surprise by his win. After Becker defeated Hank Pfister in a first-round match, Pfister said: “There are 124 other guys in the draw I’d rather play. He’s got to be among the top four or five in the world right now.”","For a tennis long shot, consider Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion. Her previous best Grand Slam performance, in seven attempts, was the third round. She was ranked 47th coming into the tournament. But she benefited from some lucky breaks in the draw, not meeting a seeded player better than No. 11 until the final, where she upended third-seeded Simona Halep to win the title.","Even more extreme was Mark Edmondson, who won the 1976 Australian Open as the 212th best player in the world. With the caveat that in that era many non-Australians skipped the event, Edmondson did beat the players seeded No. 5, No. 12 and No. 13 on his way to the semifinals, then topped No. 1 Ken Rosewall and No. 2 John Newcombe to win it all.","Edmondson had played in two previous Grand Slams, making the first and second round. Just a few weeks before the tournament he was mopping floors at a hospital to make ends meet.","“No way will something like that happen again,” Bud Collins, the journalist and TV commentator, said in 2011.",The Times said (Associated Press article on Edmondson): “One of the greatest upsets in tennis history.”,"Villanova in 1985 was the lowest-seeded team to win the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. From its No. 8 spot, it knocked off top-seeded Michigan and second-seeded North Carolina on the way to the Final Four, then beat another No. 2-seeded team, Memphis State.","The final, against No. 1 Georgetown, was the last N.C.A.A. tournament game played without a shot clock. Villanova took advantage, choosing its shots with care. In the end, it shot a remarkable 22 for 28 and a mind-boggling 9 for 10 in the second half.",It was a good decade for N.C.A.A. underdogs: Clemson in 1981 and Miami in 1983 each started the football season unranked and ended it as national champion.,"The Times said: “In what will surely be remembered as one of the most improbable outcomes in the history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, the Wildcats, who failed to finish in the nation’s Top 20 in any poll this season, completed their emotion-filled postseason by playing the elusive ‘perfect game’ at the perfect time.”","John Daly was a big hitter, but seemed to offer little else as a golfer. He wasn’t even going to play in the P.G.A. Championship in 1991, but sneaked into the field as the ninth alternate when others dropped out. As a result of the late entry, he drove all night from Memphis to Carmel, Ind., and teed off without a practice round.","He then barreled his way around the course for a three-stroke victory, launching him to a popularity that he maintains today, more than 25 years later.","“I think everybody thinks of this as a Cinderella story,” he said. “I think the fans won this tournament for me. I really do.”","The Times said: “Playing with a fearless ease that bespoke destiny, a 25-year-old rookie golfer named John Daly completed an underdog story of Rocky-like proportions today.”",Where else to find long shots but at the racetrack? The biggest longest shot to win the Kentucky Derby was Donerail in 1913 at odds of 91-1. But that is topped by the Breeders’ Cup Classic winner of 1993.,"Arcangues had raced around Britain and France without winning anything major. And all his races had been on grass. The Classic is on dirt, and regularly features the very best dirt horses in the world. So it was no surprise that Arcangues went off at odds — 133-1 — that made Donerail look like a comparative sure thing.","But Arcangues ran down the speedy Bertrando, winner of several important dirt races in the United States, and won, prompting race caller Tom Durkin to say, “Here is Arcangues to win it, in an absolute shocker!”","The Times said: “Arcangues’s winning payoff of $269.20 for $2 was the biggest in the 10-year history of the Breeders’ Cup. His price was so high that his actual odds did not even fit into the infield tote board, which only goes as high as 99-1.”","The St. Louis Rams won seven games in 1995. Then six games the following season, then five, then four. Going into the 1999 season the trend line did not look good.","When quarterback Trent Green tore up his knee in the preseason, the Rams turned to someone named Kurt Warner, who was undrafted out of Northern Iowa and whose main professional experience was with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of N.F.L. Europe.",So no surprise that the bookmakers had the Rams at 300-1 to win it all.,"Warner proceeded to lead the team to a 13-3 regular-season record, which earned him the league’s Most Valuable Player Award. The Rams then beat the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl, and Warner won another M.V.P. award.",The Times said (in a Week 1 preview): “Kurt Warner makes his first N.F.L. start. It won’t be a memorable one.” (Warner beat the Ravens with 309 passing yards and 3 touchdowns.),"All these stories are amazing. But this one is just a little more amazing than the others. The modern English Premier League is essentially a closed shop. The big teams not only take first place every year, they take second, third and fourth as well.","So no one blinked when Leicester, 14th the previous year, was listed at 5,000 to 1 to lift the league trophy. Heck, why not a million to one? For a team that was hoping to avoid relegation, winning the title seemed impossible.","But behind the smart midfield leadership of N’Golo Kante and Riyad Mahrez and the goals of Jamie Vardy, who had been discovered playing in England’s fifth division, Leicester won some games. And then some more. Much credit was given to the unconventional management style of Claudio Ranieri, and his nonsensical catch phrase, “Dilly-ding, dilly-dong.”","Leicester ended up not just winning the Premier League, but winning it by an improbable 10-point margin, leaving Arsenal, Tottenham and the Manchester teams far behind.","The Times said: “Soccer-crazed, working-class Leicester is verging on one of those ridiculous seasons, an unimaginable championship that was given worse betting odds at the start than finding Elvis alive.”",Miraculous.
The Little Sports Jacket That Could - The New York Times,"Is there a medical insurance code yet for street-style whiplash? Everyone in Florence, Italy, develops it at some point, a chronic neck ache caused by abruptly swiveling your head to get a load of some Instagram apparition in dandy drag.","The complaint is particularly acute during Pitti Uomo, the twice yearly trade fair that is to men’s wear what Coachella is to indie bands. Style mobs from all over the planet descend on this Renaissance city, trunks crammed with looks used to bait the style paparazzi who also arrive in hordes.","Part spectacle, part farce, these so-called influencers have become so essential an element of the theater of fashion that without them the giddy atmospherics of most fashion weeks might burn off like industrial gas flare. What we’d be left with would be the reality that these trade fairs are no more intrinsically interesting than a boat or auto show.","Yet here is a notion out of left field: Maybe it is time to tune out social media. Perhaps by filtering some of the seductive static produced for online consumption by guys wearing plus-four trousers or spats or capes or waxed mustaches or deerstalker caps, we can refocus on things no less radical for being subtle and discreet.","Consider L.B.M. 1911, for instance. Fashion insiders are sure to know this family-owned label, produced by a firm founded more than a century ago in the northern Italian city of Mantua. They automatically equate it with what might be the best utility sports coat a man can buy. ","Unlined and unfussy, it still retains distinguishing elements of fine Italian tailoring — that is, high armholes, a fitted but far from exaggerated body and subtle palette resulting from the use of uncolored fabrics that are garment dyed after manufacturing.","Roughly a decade ago, Nick Sullivan, the fashion director of Esquire, named the L.B.M. 1911 blazer the one jacket any stylish guy needed in his wardrobe, an opinion he has since found little reason to revise.","“I instantly loved it,"" Mr. Sullivan said. “It had all the hallmarks of Italian tailoring and personal style, but it wasn’t crazy expensive.”","By that he meant roughly $700. And, while inexpensive labor, technology and some of the less salubrious dimensions of a free market have made it possible to buy a decent (well, acceptable) suit for as little as $300 in the United States, the added value of looking better than basic comes with a cost.","Before M. Dumas & Sons, a 102-year-old retailer in Charleston, S.C., began offering the L.B.M. 1911 jackets that are now a staple, its offerings tended toward American labels and a brand of styling that was, to put it tactfully, middle of the road. ","“We hadn’t done a good enough job in evolving to include Italian product or European products in general,” said Gary Flynn, part owner and president of the store.","“Our business is pretty casual, but the L.B.M. 1911 is a soft coat, an unlined coat, what we call an empty coat,” he said, one that both meets the sartorial needs of guys occupying that sartorial gray area between the straitjacketed corporate drones and the Hoodie Horde of Mountain View, Calif., and that also justifies its price tag with the inner construction that linings are often used to hide.","Anyway, customers at M. Dumas & Sons don’t get hung up on the price of an L.B.M. 1911 blazer, Mr. Flynn said. And why should they when, as Mr. Sullivan points out, a pair of Balenciaga sneakers costs $900 and it is easy for many to drop $400 on video games without thinking too much about it?","“Guys at work are still throwing on a sports coat, but maybe with a pair of jeans,” Mr. Flynn said. “And, if they’re on the fence about price, they say: ‘Oh, shoot, it’s only $795. It’s not, like, $1,495 or $1,795.’”","What the typical consumer of L.B.M. 1911 — which occupies a central booth in the main pavilion at Pitti Uomo, just a short stroll away from that of Brunello Cucinelli, a designer who also parlayed a variant of what he calls “casual Italian elegance,” into a multi-billion-dollar global empire — is not likely to know is that every jacket comes with an unusual industrial back story.","“It’s the Model-T Ford of jackets,” Mr. Sullivan said. And, as it happens, Edgardo Bianchi, the son of the master tailor who started a small shop in Mantua in 1911, is often referred to as the Henry Ford of the Italian fashion industry.","Like Ford, Mr. Bianchi was single-minded to the point of obsession about efficiency and streamlined production. He measured his own quotidian rituals with a chronometer, organizing his regimen according to a schedule that allotted two minutes each morning for shaving and exactly enough time at breakfast to consume 28 grapes.","In reality, as his grandson Andrea Benedini said, he preferred to eat more, yet removing the detested seeds proved too time consuming. So he designed a special utensil — part knife and part spoon — that allowed him to reach his preferred allowance of 30 grapes a day.","Mr. Bianchi died in 2003, having built his modest family business into an industrial empire and been rewarded for his efforts by a knighthood conferred by the Italian government. The company he left behind is still run according to his belief that every action in life is repeated in an unending loop. ","“He was obsessed most of all with statistics,’’ said Mr. Benedini, the international export manager for Lubiam, the parent company of L.B.M. 1911. “Organization was the key word for him not only for business but for life.’’","Efficient assembly line methods are hardly the stuff of fashion innovation, and Mr. Benedini is the first to say that his men’s wear label may be, by some lights, boring.","“We don’t like a jacket with 10 pockets and a hole in the back,” Mr. Benedini said. “If you look at our collection, the models are pretty much the same each season.”",But that is not exactly the case. While a label specializing in subtle modifications by season — the current one features luxurious cotton corduroys and herringbone knits — and theme-and-variation is never going to become Instagram catnip in the age of likes and followers. ,But there’s something stealthily sexy about the low-key way that L.B.M. 1911 has built a clientele without the aid of influencers or salaried peacocks or Gucci-style frippery.,"“Guys have really embraced this deconstructed concept,"" said Steven Ramenofsky, the general merchandise manager of Garys, a specialty men’s wear retailer in Newport Beach, Calif. ","“Sure, other labels make soft jackets,” Mr. Ramenofsky said, citing better-known brands like Canali or Boglioli or Peter Millar, all of which cost considerably more than the Mantua-made jackets with the signature ceramic button on the lapel. “But, however you look at it, L.B.M. 1911 sure does hold its own.” "
"Will Sports Betting Transform How Games Are Watched, and Even Played? - The New York Times","Half an hour before a preseason hockey game last fall, Ted Leonsis strolled down the concourse of Capital One Arena in Washington, stopping every now and then to pose for someone’s selfie. Leonsis owns both the Washington Capitals, the National Hockey League team, and the arena itself, a squat behemoth that fills a block of Chinatown not far from Ford’s Theater. He also owns other teams that play there, including the Washington Wizards, in the National Basketball Association, and some smaller ones that don’t.","Leonsis is easily the most popular sports owner in the nation’s capital, though the Wizards have managed just one division title in his eight seasons and his N.H.L. team underachieved for years. It helps that the Capitals finally won the Stanley Cup last season, the city’s first championship in any major professional league in more than a quarter-century. But Leonsis is also uncommonly friendly to fans. During his customary lap around the arena, he fielded questions from anyone who came up to him. It was hard to imagine many big-league owners doing the same.","A middle-aged African-American man in a Capitals jersey approached Leonsis. “What about that gambling thing?” he asked. A few months before, the federal statute prohibiting sports gambling was overturned by the Supreme Court; this was the first home game since a few states, newly liberated to set their own gambling agendas, had implemented laws allowing sports bets. Leonsis has been vocal about his support for legal gambling, and he was full of ideas. One was a sports bar he planned to put inside the arena that would handle bets. It would fit into a space currently occupied by a brewpub, or perhaps displace a fitness center. He envisioned betting windows, like those at a horse track.","Sports gambling wasn’t yet legal in the District of Columbia, and until it was, there would be no betting windows. But Leonsis is confident that they will come. “Eventually,” he told me, the bar “will be somewhere that fans can congregate and watch games and bet on the games in whatever way they want to” — whether at the windows or on hand-held devices. Leonsis would outsource the bookmaking, because owning a team while taking bets on its games would be perceived as a conflict of interest (and probably be illegal). Instead, he would simply offer a site for eating, drinking and more gambling. “Except that I want to outlaw the word ‘gambling,’ ” he said. “Maybe call it ‘interactive wagering.’ When you hear ‘gambling,’ you think of Tony Soprano — ‘I’m with my bookie.’ People who bet on N.C.A.A. pools at their church, they don’t think they’re gambling. They are.”","Leonsis, who held various executive positions at America Online from 1994 to 2007, says he doesn’t gamble — not on sports or on anything else. Yet he has risked both his reputation and his capital on the future of sports wagering. He owns a stake in DraftKings, a daily sports fantasy company that has segued into online gambling. He has invested in Sportradar, which delivers, at high speed, information on games in progress to bookmaking websites, creating the sort of advantage enjoyed by Wall Street traders who, in his words, “get a quarter of a second more to say ‘buy that stock.’ ” He owns part of WinView, which holds numerous patents for various aspects of in-game gambling. He hopes to fill the schedule of the NBC Sports Washington cable channel, of which he owns a third, with chatter about point spreads and gambling opportunities. “Like CNBC,” he says.","Gambling on sports became explicitly legal in Nevada in 1949. Until recently, the prospect of it spreading beyond that state’s borders was treated as potentially ruinous by the franchise owners and commissioners who ruled over sports. They feared that it would alter the relationship between fans and their favorite teams, and that gambling would expose athletes to underworld characters trying to manipulate games. Eventually, the cautionary tale went, the competition in even the biggest leagues would be indistinguishable from the manufactured plotlines of pro wrestling or old-time roller derby. Gambling on sports was already happening, of course — at Las Vegas casinos, on illegal internet sites, at the corner bar — yet somehow that hadn’t made it more palatable. “Even five years ago,” says Steve Murray, a partner with Leonsis in the venture-capital firm that has invested in many of these businesses, “you would have had a hard time finding a single owner in any of these leagues saying that gambling was a good idea. You wouldn’t have been able to do it.”","Since then, attitudes seem to have changed abruptly. It’s now difficult to find anyone inside sports who opposes gambling. In part that’s because the leagues and their investors have come to see how much they stand to gain. But it’s also a result of insiders like Leonsis evangelizing to anyone who would listen: in owners’ meetings, in conversations with sponsors, even with U.S. congressmen during a 2017 gambling conference on Capitol Hill. “He’s a visionary, and he speaks quite eloquently about what the future opportunities are,” says Gary Bettman, the N.H.L.’s commissioner, who until recently strongly opposed gambling on sports. “He has been at the forefront of pushing us to make sure we’re as knowledgeable as we can be. I get emails on this from him daily — more than daily.”","Leonsis speaks slowly but exuberantly. His conversation unfolds as logically as a business plan. “What are you so afraid of?” he likes to ask anyone who seems uneasy about gambling. “We’re going to create more jobs. We’re going to generate more taxes.” While pro athletes were once paid poorly enough to make the offers of payoffs enticing, Leonsis argues that a vast majority are today far wealthier than anyone who might tempt them. “I don’t think an N.B.A. player is susceptible to some hustler saying, ‘Shave the points, and here’s $5,000 in hundred-dollar bills,’ ” he says.","Leonsis arrived back at his suite shortly after the opening face-off. He sat down in time to see the Boston Bruins score a goal. I mentioned that where sports wagers were now legal, gamblers had surely placed bets both for and against the Capitals. Leonsis wanted his team to win, naturally, even though this preseason game didn’t really count. But he admitted that just the fact that those bets could be made meant that, in a sense, he’d already won.","In the middle of the 20th century, television began reframing the way we experience sports. It gave us replays and extended timeouts, pushed World Series games into prime time, scrambled conference affiliations. Through national telecasts and highlights and, later, superstations and cable networks, fans grew intimate with teams many hundreds of miles away. Now gambling is poised to unleash changes just as transformative, and they may come fast. In an October report, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that a fully developed sports gambling industry in all states would draw $100 billion in bets every year; the congressional National Gambling Impact Study Commission has suggested the figure could be closer to $400 billion. Whatever the size of the jackpot, leagues, teams and broadcasters will want their piece of it. “The players, the sponsors, all the stakeholders in the ecosystem can become beneficiaries of this,” says Peter Guber, an owner of both the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Dodgers.","The games we watch are already enhanced by data collected through technological advances. Announcers tell us how hard baseballs are hit and how far they travel, or how many miles a particularly active soccer player has run. Because such derivatives create new opportunities for betting, we’re sure to see many more of them. (The N.B.A. has been advertising for a gambling data analyst on the employment website Glassdoor.) Hockey hasn’t traditionally generated much in the way of metrics, but in order to learn who is skating the fastest or shooting the hardest, the N.H.L. is preparing to record the movements of every player during every game and even put a chip inside the puck. “Leagues are building a fire hose of data around their product,” says Chris Grove, an analyst who consults for gaming companies and investors. “And the logical recipient of that data is the betting industry.”","What are the chances that someone homers in the next two innings? Or kicks a field goal in the next five minutes? Imagine those odds sliding across the bottom of your screen like the CNN news crawl. As a sports media consultant and former N.B.A. executive named Ed Desser puts it, “How does the production and presentation of telecasts change to accommodate gambling?” Explicit references to betting might seem jarring during a Masters broadcast, which has the feel of a conversation in a Ritz-Carlton lobby. But Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson’s made-for-TV showdown in November, which included such information, gave viewers more reasons to care about what happened.","Real-time digital wagering has created betting opportunities that don’t rely on the score; the appeal of a game in which the Patriots are up by 30 points in the fourth quarter is altogether different if you can put money down right then on how many more first downs they’ll get. As viewers create their own narrative tension by betting on pieces of the action, broadcast rights fees will increase and franchise values soar. That tension could also be artificially created and exploited by event promoters too. “If you’re the U.F.C. and you have an absolute dog of a fight on a major card for whatever reason, you could use odds and promotions around betting to drive fan interest,” Grove points out. “You could use betting proactively.”","Legal gambling also opens the door to an entirely new source of sponsorship income. In English soccer, 26 of the 44 teams that compete in the sport’s top echelons wear shirts festooned with the names of bookmaking sites. Don’t be surprised to see them soon in the N.B.A. or Major League Soccer. Games will be held in venues with names like the Bet365 Bowl or Caesars Coliseum and be analyzed by touts on TV and subscription podcasts. “As you create more interest in these things, people want more information,” Desser says. “And they’re always looking for an edge.”","Perhaps nobody sees more dollar signs on the horizon than legislators. It remains uncertain how quickly states will continue to pass new gambling laws, or how broad or restrictive those will be, but few dispute the potential impact. “I was talking to some economic development people from Alabama,” says Jack Evans, a District of Columbia council member who introduced a sports gambling bill there that is expected to become law in March. “They were asking how they could raise money. I told them: ‘Put in sports gambling and you can pay off all your debts on the Alabama-Auburn football game alone. One game, Alabama and Auburn. You’d make billions.’ ”","Leonsis has a stake in nearly all of these possibilities. He envisions simulcasts of every Wizards and Capitals game on NBC Sports Washington that will include a steady stream of betting information. He controls two teams in the resurrected Arena Football League and is pitching networks a gambling-centric concept for its games that’s too overt for the stodgy N.F.L., at least for now. Sportradar’s chief executive told me he expects its $2.4 billion valuation to quintuple in three years with the opening of the U.S. market, which will mean the same for Leonsis’s stake. And if franchise values rise because of fans’ increased engagement in the sports they follow, Leonsis’s N.H.L. and N.B.A. teams could be his most profitable gambling plays of all. In time, sports betting may generate its own Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, some forward-thinking entrepreneur who comes to define the zeitgeist of his generation. For now, though, the person whose odds are as great as anyone’s to profit from this emerging industry is Leonsis, a 62-year-old billionaire who has been around since the early days of the World Wide Web.","The history of regulated gambling in America goes back to 1931, when Nevada opened the nation’s first casinos. The state was on the verge of bankruptcy, a predicament that motivated it to defy the prevailing national sentiment against gambling. “Any state could have done it,” says Anthony Cabot, who teaches gaming law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “But no others did.” Just as pro football was starting to thrive, Nevada broadened its gambling law to regulate sports bets. Over the next half-century, American attitudes toward gambling evolved. In 1978, with great fanfare, casinos opened in Atlantic City. A decade later, Congress passed a law permitting them on land owned by Native American tribes. By 2003, a Gallup Poll revealed, nearly half of all Americans had played the lottery in the previous 12 months; almost a third had visited a casino. But just 10 percent had bet on a pro sports event, mostly because there were few legal ways to do it.","Nobody tried to legalize sports betting outside Nevada until Chris Christie. By the time Christie became New Jersey’s governor in 2010, Atlantic City was in trouble. The novelty appeal of its casinos had faded. Hotel bookings had plummeted — and tax-generating casino revenues with them. Christie saw sports betting as a way to counter those losses. His first year in office, he pushed a referendum that would allow it at any racetrack or casino in the state. The referendum passed, and Christie signed it into law.","There was only one problem. Through the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 — which, in a somewhat curious twist, had been sponsored by New Jersey’s own Bill Bradley, the former N.B.A. great turned senator — the federal government banned sports gambling throughout the country, beyond a few existing manifestations that were allowed to continue. Those included betting on bicycle racing in New Mexico and golf in Wyoming, several sports-based lotteries, horse racing, jai alai and the bookmaking inside Nevada’s casinos.","In 2014, New Jersey’s referendum was challenged in court by the N.C.A.A. The major sports leagues joined the suit as plaintiffs. But Christie had calculated that the Supreme Court wouldn’t uphold a law banning a recreational pursuit in 49 states that had been legal for decades in the 50th, and he was right. The court, analysts noted, wanted to make a show of limiting federal jurisdiction. “They just happened to pick a gambling law to do so,” Cabot says. Last May’s verdict in what had been renamed Murphy v. N.C.A.A., after Christie’s successor, Phil Murphy, surprised the gambling industry. “You’d be amazed how many casino operators didn’t see it coming,” says Greg Carlin, co-founder and chief executive of Rush Street Gaming, which owns casinos in Pennsylvania, New York and Illinois. It didn’t surprise Leonsis, though. He’d been planning on it for years.","Leonsis dates his personal revelation about gambling to November 2015, when he found himself visiting the remote southwest coast of Scotland. His daughter, who lived in London, had a serious boyfriend, and both families had flown in to spend Thanksgiving weekend at a manor house owned by the boyfriend’s parents. On a clear day, Leonsis was told, you could see Ireland across the water. He never could confirm that, though, because the weather was never clear. The basketball and hockey seasons were underway back home, but the house had no internet or satellite reception, so Leonsis couldn’t follow his teams. It was foggy and cold. “There was nothing to do,” he says.","The closest village of any size, Campbeltown, was 40 minutes away. One morning, they all drove in for lunch. Nobody seemed to be around. “The whole town is like two blocks long,” Leonsis says. “And there’s one restaurant and a pharmacy. And then we saw one place that had some life to it.” Inside a storefront, a crowd was making noise. It was the betting parlor, Leonsis learned. The phrase didn’t carry any connotation of disrepute, as it would in America. “It was just, ‘This is where you go and watch a game and see your friends and hang out,’ ” he said. “It was the ‘Cheers’ of Campbeltown.”","From Scotland, Leonsis went to London. Driving through his daughter’s neighborhood, he noticed one betting parlor after another. “Like in America, where you’d have a Starbucks,” he says. He investigated and found that you could bet on sports at 8,500 outlets in the United Kingdom. As a comparison, he looked up Domino’s pizza and saw that it had roughly 5,500 stores across the United States. “For me, that was the beginning of, ‘Hey, this is a true consumer phenomenon,’ ” he says. The parlors seemed inviting. They weren’t seedy haunts for professional gamblers. “This is not Off-Track Betting,” Leonsis says. “This is Starbucks or Domino’s. This is popularized and accepted in the most remote places and the most centrally located places. If you wanted to find a proxy of what could happen here, you just had to look at Campbeltown and London.”","Adam Silver, who is now the N.B.A.’s commissioner, had been doing just that. From 1998 to 2006, Silver ran the league’s video production and programming. On frequent business trips abroad, he couldn’t help noticing how pervasive gambling was. Stadiums had betting kiosks beside their snack bars. “There was this enormous legalized infrastructure in place,” Silver says. Yet somehow, leagues and teams hadn’t been corrupted. In fact, they were thriving. Silver’s boss at the time, David Stern, was a lawyer who had come to the sport during college basketball’s betting scandals of the 1960s. Throughout his tenure, Stern remained opposed to gambling — he later changed his mind — and for years even refused to hold league meetings and other events in Las Vegas. “But the opportunity seemed fairly obvious to me,” Silver says.","In 2014, Silver succeeded Stern as N.B.A. commissioner. That year, in a New York Times Op-Ed, he made an argument that did not differ much from those advocating the legalization of marijuana. “Despite legal restrictions, sports betting is widespread,” he wrote. “Because there are few legal options available, those who wish to bet resort to illicit bookmaking operations and shady offshore websites.” Why not bring the action into the light, he proposed, where it could be regulated, and the movement of betting lines and the sums of money monitored?","Earlier that fall, the N.B.A. signed a nine-year, $24 billion television rights deal. At the league’s board of governors meeting in New York, Leonsis, who was chairman of its media committee, presented it to the rest of the owners. Even as he celebrated the deal, he cautioned that such fees were unlikely to grow, though the cost of operating teams inevitably would. “We have to find new pots of gold,” he said.","Leonsis believed he had found them on that trip to the United Kingdom. You can hold your nose all you want, he later told his colleagues, but gambling offered a viable and wholly untapped source of revenue for the N.B.A. Leonsis can be almost courtly in negotiations, and he was polite when he met resistance. Privately, though, he shook his head. How could you ignore such an opportunity, ready to be taken advantage of as soon as the law allowed? What are you so afraid of?","For decades, sports gambling tended to be a static experience. You bet on a team and handed money to somebody, and maybe got a slip of paper in return. Then you waited to find out if you were right. That changed when three American options traders moved to Antigua in the mid-1990s to create an online gambling business they named World Sports Exchange. Instead of offering point spreads, World Sports Exchange operated like a commodities market. Before tipoff, options on the favored Lakers, for example, might cost $60 each. Options on the Knicks, the underdogs, might sell for $40. At the end of the game, the options on the losing team would become worthless, while the options on the winning team would each pay out $100.","But here was the novelty: You didn’t have to wait until the game was over to cash in. If the Lakers scored the first eight points, the value of that $60 option might grow to, say, $72. You could sell it and pocket your $12 gain. You might then invest in the Knicks at a discount. Or you might wait for the price to fall and buy another option on the Lakers. You could buy and sell options, on either team or both, throughout the game. Once you’d started, it was hard to stop until the game ended. It was exhausting. It was also great fun. And even more than the other bookmakers operating beyond U.S. borders, which were handling traditional bets, it seemed to threaten the monopoly on sports gambling that Nevada’s casinos had long enjoyed.","I met one of those traders, Haden Ware, under a thatched roof in the Caribbean in early 2000. He was drinking beer and eating lobster salad. Steve Schillinger, a partner at World Sports Exchange, later confided to me that he and Ware were each making more than $1 million a year. Yet they were miserable. The Interstate Wire Act of 1961 had outlawed taking bets over telephone lines. In that era of dial-up internet access, that’s exactly what World Sports Exchange was doing. Online gambling was “especially pernicious,” in the words of Jon Kyl, the U.S. senator from Arizona. “You get up in the morning and log on to your computer and start to gamble. It plays to the addictive nature of many people, especially kids.” Quoting an unnamed Harvard professor, Kyl called it “the crack cocaine of gambling.” A conservative Republican, Kyl introduced specific legislation against internet gambling and vowed to indict expats taking bets online. In 1998, 21 U.S. citizens were charged with Wire Act violations. Among them were Ware, Schillinger and Jay Cohen, another partner. Weary of living in exile, Cohen flew home. He was convicted and served 18 months in prison. Janet Reno, the U.S. Attorney General, backed Kyl’s efforts. So did casinos, sports leagues and gambling interest groups — just about everyone, in fact, except some Indian tribes. Even the lobbyist being paid by World Sports Exchange acknowledged that the opponents of digital gambling had a point. “The casinos worked a long time to establish legitimacy,” he told me.","Eventually, World Sports Exchange was overtaken by better-funded rivals. It ceased operations in 2013. That same day, Schillinger committed suicide. After serving his sentence, Cohen disappeared to Europe. By then, though, their insight that betting doesn’t have to stop when play begins had revolutionized the industry; what DraftKings and its competitors are currently doing in New Jersey, and what companies like Betfair and Bet365 do in England, could not exist without it.","Since the demise of World Sports Exchange, sports betting on various hand-held devices has proliferated. And because smartphones and tablets routinely capture the details of each transaction, proponents argue that games are actually better protected against manipulation when digital betting is legal. “If there was a huge bet placed against a team two hours before an announcement that its star player wouldn’t be participating, that is something that should cause us to investigate,” Silver says. “And it’s something that historically we wouldn’t have known.”","For many N.B.A. owners — and some in other leagues as well — the conversion began in 2014 with Silver’s Op-Ed and his argument that legalization actually offered more protection, not less, from the unsavory characters who might try to influence players. Europe was proving to be a test case, and its teams were thriving. Now Leonsis has come along, telling owners that their franchises would gain in value because gambling, like fantasy leagues, gives fans another reason to be engrossed in a sport.","“Ted was able to articulate the value proposition of not just the betting, but the deepening of the engagement,” Guber says. Rather than customers, Leonsis thinks of fans as an audience. “He understood that audiences want experiences,” Guber says. “This gives them a chance to walk away telling their own story — ‘I saw this opportunity, I recognized what this player would be able to accomplish.’ When you have a tool that makes an audience more of a participant than a passenger, it’s a very vital and vibrant element.”","There are risks inherent in legalizing sports gambling, Guber believes. But after talking with Leonsis, he became convinced that its opportunities far outweighed them. The N.B.A. was still a plaintiff when the Supreme Court heard the gambling case in late 2017, but by then Guber was among the many owners who were rooting for New Jersey to win.","One afternoon last October, Terry Link drove from his home outside Chicago to Springfield, the Illinois state capital. An informational presentation about gambling was scheduled in the House of Representatives the following day, and Link, a Democrat who serves as assistant majority leader in the Illinois Senate, wanted to attend. Since he was first elected in 1996, he has sponsored several gambling bills. Not one became law. “I’m still waiting to get one signed,” he says ruefully.","Before dinner that evening, he stopped into a bar to meet Jeremy Kudon, a lobbyist whom DraftKings and its competitor FanDuel have hired to help persuade legislators to pass laws allowing digital gambling. After ordering a soda, Link told Kudon that Illinois casinos hoped to use sports betting to get new customers into their buildings. He reminded Kudon that casinos have generated plenty of tax money for the state. Because of that, Link said, he wouldn’t favor a bill that would allow gamblers to undermine them by “placing bets from the couches in their living rooms.”","This was a problem for Kudon, because bets placed from living-room couches are exactly what his clients need to survive. Kudon argued that gamblers were already betting from their couches, but doing so on illegal websites. And the state was missing out on its cut.","DraftKings and FanDuel, whose valuations are both estimated to exceed $1 billion, were founded on the same idea: curate a limitless number of fantasy leagues for profit, generated by participation fees, and let customers choose new players every day. For many fans, watching games quickly became the equivalent of monitoring their investment portfolios, except the investments were bets on individual players. Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general at the time, thought that sounded a lot like gambling.","Games of skill are legal in every state; you can pay to participate in fishing or bowling competitions, for example, and win cash prizes. What you can’t do is bet on who you think will win those competitions. The fantasy sites argued, somewhat tenuously, that constructing a winning team is more like fishing than knowing who is good at fishing. Schneiderman disagreed. In 2015, he shut down both sites and fined the companies. At that point, DraftKings and FanDuel began working to get bills passed in state legislatures that would certify fantasy sports as legal.","Soon after, Leonsis bought part of DraftKings. He tends to characterize troubled companies in one of two ways — as either “falling angels,” which eventually rise again, or as “falling knives,” which don’t. In DraftKings, he saw a falling angel. He anticipated that digital sports betting would become legal, and he agreed with Jason Robins, the DraftKings chief executive, that the gaming-industry giants everyone assumed would dominate the U.S. market — the English bookmaker William Hill or maybe Bally’s or Caesars — were actually at a disadvantage. “We have a big database of customers that we know from research are already betting on sports, mostly with black-market websites,” Robins says. “And we have a brand that is much more identified with winning money and betting on sports than any of them that we’re competing with.”","Last summer, DraftKings partnered with a casino, as New Jersey’s law requires, and became the first company to begin taking digital bets. Since then, it has done more online business than any other bookmaker. Its ads blanket cable networks in New Jersey. “Get ready for thousands of ways to bet!” they shout — and they’re not exaggerating. One DraftKings executive estimates that the company’s app averages 45,000 to 55,000 different propositions for gamblers to consider every day.","But sports gambling laws enacted in most other states have restricted digital activity. Mississippi allows it, but only if the gamblers are physically inside a casino. Delaware’s law has not yet allowed any digital betting at all. Some casinos plan to leverage their brands online, but many regard digital gambling as a threat. “We have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in our casinos,” says Dan Kehl, the chief executive of Elite Casino Resorts, whose family has been in the gambling business in Iowa since 1990.","Kehl backs a bill that would require anyone who wants to bet on sports to first register at one of Iowa’s 19 casinos. That wouldn’t work in larger states, he acknowledges, but no one in Iowa is more than an hour’s drive from a casino. Registered gamblers could bet digitally, though on only a limited selection of propositions. “The question is, how far can we let the mobile go?” Kehl says. That troubles Leonsis, not just because DraftKings might not get the right to operate profitably there, but because nobody will. If gamblers betting on illegal sites can’t be persuaded to bet legally, much of the windfall that investors and politicians like Terry Link are anticipating won’t materialize. It’s not enough that states pass laws legalizing sports betting, Leonsis explains; they have to pass the right law. “The only way that gambling doesn’t work,” he says, “is if the revenue projections are off. If it turns out that all those estimates we hear are wildly inaccurate.”","Despite Kudon’s best efforts, laws that Leonsis considers favorable have been a difficult sell, mostly because of political pressure from casinos. In Springfield that evening, Link acknowledged that he personally favored digital sites partnering with casinos and paying them fees. But, he told Kudon, the Illinois casinos insist that whatever fees they’d get wouldn’t make up for the loss of all those potential roulette players. At that, Kudon rolled his eyes. “The gamblers that we’re talking about aren’t going to casinos,” he said. “They’ll never set foot in Rivers,” a casino in Des Plaines, Ill., “because they can bet on sports on these illegal sites. So let’s encourage them to go on DraftKings or FanDuel instead, and Rivers will get a benefit.” To Kudon, the mathematics are clear. “The state gets its licensing fee, and now we’ve gotten rid of the black market,” he said. “That seems like a win to everyone.”","If Link’s bill allowed hand-held gambling, as Kudon fantasized, travelers might even make bets while changing planes at O’Hare airport. He urged Link to consider what that would mean for Illinois, the millions of tax dollars that might be generated if gamblers didn’t have to travel to a casino to bet. Link stroked his chin. “I don’t think there’s a right answer yet,” Link said. “You have to look at all the factors involved. In New Jersey, nobody wants to go to the Boardwalk anymore. All the casinos there are going kaput.”","He sighed. Common ground seemed a long way away. “Listen, there’s no such thing as a perfect bill,” he said. “The reason we don’t pass these bills comes down to one word: ‘greed.’ Nobody wants part of the pie — they want the whole damn pie.”","Last July, Silver announced that the N.B.A. had, in a sponsorship deal, granted MGM Resorts the right to use league logos and data. Even the N.H.L.’s Bettman has come to terms with gambling. “We’ve had a very practical approach,” he told me in his office a few months later. The previous afternoon, the N.H.L. announced its own deal with MGM, though the payment involved was said to be far smaller than the N.B.A.’s.","But gambling’s greatest impact, at least proportionally, could come in the new professional leagues it spawns and the moribund ones it helps to resurrect. The Arena Football League once included 19 teams spread across the continent; last year there were four. Leonsis owns the Washington and Baltimore franchises, which makes him not only the most powerful owner in the league but the only person preventing its demise. He has positioned it as an ideal entertainment vehicle for the next generation. That includes gambling, of course. Arena Football averages a touchdown every six plays, Leonsis notes, as well as 98 points a game. “Lots of data generated,” he says — and a multitude of possible bets.","Greater than $30 billion has been bet legally on football since 1992, according to the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. That’s about 50 percent more than on basketball, and double the amount bet on baseball. Leonsis wants to expand the A.F.L. to six franchises, and eventually to 12. But his vision mandates a network partner that will market the game as the anti-N.F.L.: informal, expressive and gambling-friendly. It doesn’t matter that the league, as currently constituted, has almost no history, he says. Your favorite team will be the one you have money on at the moment.","On a private flight to New York last fall, Leonsis ran through a pitch he planned to show Sean McManus, who runs the sports department at CBS. He envisioned fast-paced telecasts of A.F.L. games on an affiliated sports channel. But as the plane landed in Teterboro, N.J., he confided that he doesn’t believe CBS will end up investing. Its executives are leery of jeopardizing their relationship with the N.F.L., he said, and that’s probably wise. The N.F.L. most likely wouldn’t look kindly on one of its primary partners’ televising another football league’s games. As usual, though, Leonsis was looking further ahead.","“If the N.F.L. is smart, they should want CBS to do this,” he said. “See how far they can take it. Let the A.F.L. be the canary in the coal mine. See what works and what doesn’t work, and then they can pull back from there on their own telecasts.” He paused. “CBS is going to be very nice to us today, but I don’t know if they’re ready for this. We’re going to blow their minds.”","An hour later, he was still stuck in New Jersey traffic. He also hadn’t stopped talking about gambling. But while his ideas had the potential to be wildly lucrative, I was struck by how little had actually happened in the months since the Supreme Court ruling. The betting parlor in his arena remained theoretical. DraftKings was thriving in New Jersey, but it hadn’t yet been licensed in another state. Sportradar’s explosive growth still existed only in the imagination of its chief executive. And most of the gambling laws being considered in state legislatures included severe limitations on digital play. As a result, in most states that have passed gambling laws, early revenues haven’t met projections. The growth process is slow, Leonsis admitted, and unpredictable. Yet he remained optimistic. “At AOL, it took us 10 years to get to 5 million” users, he said. “Then it took us five years to get to 30 million.”","Just then, his car passed a billboard for a casino that read “Fire Your Bookie.” Leonsis pulled out his phone. “Look,” he said. “I’ll show you.” The DraftKings app was pulsing with offers. There were odds on who would win that night’s N.F.L. game and by how much, but also bets on total points on various games, odds on tennis matches, even European basketball. I was scrolling through them when we entered the Holland Tunnel and everything vanished. “We just passed into New York,” Leonsis said. “So now it won’t work.”","A moment before, I’d been a legal gambler. Now, if I tried to place a bet from the same seat in the same car, I’d be breaking the law. I didn’t say anything, but Leonsis must have read the incredulity in my expression. He shrugged.","“It’s a work in progress,” he said."
"Sports Betting May Soon Be Legal in New York, but Only 4 Casinos Upstate Would Offer It - The New York Times",[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],"ALBANY — New York moved a giant step toward legalized sports betting on Monday, as the State Gaming Commission offered initial approval of a 33-page set of proposed rules that would allow such wagers at four upstate casinos.","The unanimous decision of the seven-person commission comes less than a year after a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for such operations outside of Nevada, which once had a monopoly on betting parlors under a 1992 law.","Since then, other states have legalized sports betting, including New Jersey, whose lawmakers had long clamored for it and passed it last year. The state now allows such betting in casinos and at racetracks, and also allows people within the state’s borders to place wagers online.","The New York State Legislature has yet to pass a law that could replicate New Jersey’s expansive offerings, so on Monday, the commission took the initiative by signing off on a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” designed to allow hometown fans to have another reason to bemoan the Knicks, Jets, Giants or Mets.","But hold your horses. While the gaming commission has certainly matriculated the ball down the field, nothing will happen in time for you to legally bet on the Super Bowl this weekend in New York. Here is a quick explanation of where things lie.","Well, you can if you go to New Jersey, but in New York the gaming commission’s decision will not become official until after a 60-day public comment period, after which the commission still needs to review those comments and then formally adopt the rule — presuming there is no objections. That means that there will be no betting in New York casinos until late March, at the absolute earliest (maybe just in time for baseball’s opening day or the Final Four). The casinos will also need a “sports pool license” to be issued by the Gaming Commission.","That said, preparations are underway for sports betting at all four casinos, with plans being drawn up for lounges, big screens and tote boards listing all manner of point spreads and money lines.","“Our customers want this form of gaming,” said Steven A. Greenberg, a spokesman for the del Lago Casino in Tyre, N.Y. “And we’re excited to be able to offer it to them.”","Uh, no. Not even close. The closest of the four casinos is Resorts World Catskills in Monticello, N.Y.; sports betting will also be allowed at the Rivers Casino in Schenectady; the del Lago Casino, in Tyre, a small town southeast of Rochester; and Tioga Downs, west of Binghamton.","The reason the four are so far-flung — as least from a New York City perspective — is rooted in the 2013 law that authorized the expansion of casinos in New York, part of a plan pushed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as a way to enliven long-sluggish upstate communities and their economies. That has not happened, as all four have struggled to meet their promises of tax revenue and in some cases, their debt payments.","The governor’s embrace of sports betting is an acknowledgment of how it could help draw people to those casinos, as well as an acknowledgment of the competition from other states (see New Jersey).","Those ads, for companies like FanDuel and DraftKings, are aimed for New Jersey residents and sports gamblers visiting the state.","It is not at all clear if New York will authorize online betting, which is a potentially much bigger moneymaker than the so-called brick-and-mortar operations the Gaming Commission gave its initial approval to on Monday.","The Cuomo administration has expressed the opinion that authorizing online bets would require changing the State Constitution. That is a time-consuming process; any such change would require passage by two separate legislatures and approval via a voter referendum. That means 2021, at the very earliest. Needless to say, casinos are not pleased by this interpretation or this timetable.",New York sports bettors do have one option that their New Jersey brethren do not: tribal casinos.,"Betting will likely be available at Turning Stone, the hugely successful operation outside Syracuse, which is owned by the Oneida Indian Nation. Earlier this month, the Oneidas announced a partnership with Caesar’s Entertainment to open betting lounges at Turning Stone and two other smaller casinos nearby in 2019.","Pretty much any professional or major collegiate sporting event. Betting on politics and other cultural events — the winner of “The Voice,” for example, or the coming Democratic presidential primary cage-match — will not be allowed.","No one under age 21 will be allowed to bet, and the rules provide that casinos can decline any bet over $10,000. Though it seems unlikely that the struggling upstate casinos are likely to turn people away. Sports betting is not the most lucrative game for casinos — slot machines, for example, generate far more profits — but they do offer an amenity to get bettors to come and spend time. As one chief executive, Ryan Eller of Empire Resorts, put it: “Casinos that already offer sports betting have seen an increase in companion play.”","Translation: People like to sit around and watch professional sports, particularly if they have money on it. And while they are there, they might throw a few bucks on a table or in a slot machine.","Not without online gaming, casino officials say. There is an enormous market for betting on your phone or laptop, and not just with sites affiliated with New Jersey casinos. Offshore sites offer wagers on anything from snooker to Icelandic basketball to American politics (where Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat is considered a very, very long shot to win the 2020 Democratic nomination).","Until that is legalized by the Legislature and the voters, however, gamblers will have to go to casinos to place their bets, and casinos are promising to welcome them with open arms. At Turning Stone, for example, officials are already constructing their betting parlor, promising a 48-by-9-foot curved screen visible from three sides, as well as 17 other massive televisions, something the casino promises will “create a ‘wow’ impact.”",Now if someone could just fix the Knicks.

Feud Over Soccer Piracy Deepens as A.F.C. Ends BeIN Sports Contract - The New York Times,"A toxic political dispute is threatening to sink the Persian Gulf’s biggest sports television contract, a development that could have repercussions for other broadcast rights agreements worth billions of dollars.","The Asian Football Confederation, the governing body for soccer in the region, on Tuesday unilaterally broke its exclusive contract with its Middle Eastern broadcast partner, the Qatar-based beIN Media Group, so that it could broadcast matches in Saudi Arabia, a country where beIN has been banned amid a bitter diplomatic and economic crisis between Gulf neighbors that is now in its second year.","The A.F.C’s decision to nullify its contract for the broadcast rights to games in Saudi Arabia comes even after rulers there have allowed a major piracy operation, perhaps the most sophisticated in television history, to steal billions of dollars of sports content owned by beIN since 2017.","BeIN’s rights deals with the A.F.C., which run through 2020, are worth $300 million. The broadcaster immediately announced its intention to file a lawsuit to counter the decision to strip it of the rights to games broadcast in Saudi Arabia, which comes weeks before the A.F.C.’s president, Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, stands for re-election. His opposition in that vote consists of a candidate from the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, and another from Qatar.","Yousef Al-Obaidly, beIN’s chief executive, said Tuesday’s decision was not a coincidence; he accused the A.F.C. of colluding with Saudi Arabia ahead of April’s election.","“It is remarkable to see the governing body of football across Asia — which should, by definition, be apolitical — putting politics ahead of its long-term commercial interests and established legitimate relationships,” Al-Obaidly told The New York Times in an emailed statement. “We will use the full force of international law to claim every dollar of damages we have and will incur as a result of the A.F.C.’s unilateral breach of our agreement.”","Previously, the A.F.C. had issued strongly worded condemnations of the theft of beIN’s programming and threats of legal action against the Saudi-based piracy operation, dubbed BeoutQ.","The dispute comes at a delicate time, with beIN Media and the A.F.C locked in negotiations over a new regional contract. The A.F.C. had tried to persuade beIN to agree to purchase future rights but without access to Saudi Arabia, the Gulf’s biggest market.","News of a separate deal with the A.F.C. for the Saudi rights was first announced by the Saudi soccer federation, well before the A.F.C.’s released its own brief statement on the matter almost 24 hours later.","Salman, who is also a FIFA vice president, has made no comment. The A.F.C said its decision to stream games in Saudi Arabia on its own channels was an attempt to tackle piracy. But within hours, its content was available on other platforms across Saudi Arabia, including on the free-to-air channel Saudi 24. A promise to geoblock coverage so it could only be viewed inside the Gulf’s most-populous country also failed, with the A.F.C.’s stream of its Champions League games available outside the kingdom.","Rights owners across the spectrum of sports, from FIFA to the governing bodies for tennis and track and field, have lodged complaints over the industrial scale piracy of their broadcast rights by BeoutQ. The latest twist could threaten the billions of dollars in income those organizations are able to extract for their content, according to beIN. The company said broadcasters would be unlikely to pay vast sums for exclusive contracts if those rights could be protected.","“There is now no guaranteed protection of intellectual property in the region to due to the A.F.C. in effect endorsing Saudi Arabia’s theft of world sport and wholesale disregard for the international rule of law,” the network said.",CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first hat trick for Juventus to send the club into the Champions League quarterfinals with a 3-0 win over Atlético Madrid on Tuesday. The Italian side fought back from a two-goal first-leg defeat.,"Ronaldo scored from open play in each half and then converted a late penalty as Juventus advanced by 3-2 on aggregate, ending Atlético’s hopes of reaching the final, which will be held in its Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.","It was Ronaldo’s eighth hat trick in the competition, moving him even with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and demonstrating why Juventus paid Real Madrid 112 million euros (then $131.5 million) for the Portuguese forward, who has dominated the competition in recent years. Ronaldo is seeking a fourth straight Champions League title; Real Madrid was eliminated without him by Ajax last week.",It was the first time Juventus came back from a two-goal defeat in the first leg.,"“Maybe that’s why Juventus signed me,” Ronaldo said. “To help it do things that it had never done before. This result is a great push for the future. We’re strong and we showed it.”","Manchester City also advanced to the quarterfinals, routing Schalke by 7-0 to progress on aggregate, 10-2.",Juventus thought it had taken the lead less than three minutes into its game but a video review confirmed that Ronaldo had fouled Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak before Giorgio Chiellini fired in the rebound.,"But a goal eventually came when Italy forward Federico Bernardeschi put in a cross from the left for Ronaldo to head in at the far post in the 27th minute. Ronaldo got his second goal three minutes into the second half, as Joao Cancelo put in a cross from the right. Although Oblak clawed Ronaldo’s header out from under his crossbar, goal-line technology confirmed the ball had crossed the line.","Juventus went all out attack and got the decisive third goal four minutes from the final whistle, when Bernardeschi was nudged over in the penalty area. Ronaldo converted the resulting penalty kick.","In Manchester, Manchester City tied the record for the biggest win in the Round of 16 of the Champions League by thrashing Schalke.","Sergio Agüero scored twice in the first half for City, and Leroy Sané rolled in another goal before halftime before Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus added second-half goals."

Imagine showing up to work tomorrow and finding yourself sent to Albuquerque along with Bob from Accounting for some young coding prospects.","Given all the trades in all the sports over the years, it is not surprising that there have been some unusual ones.","Guys have been traded for one, two, three, four or even five other players. Players have been traded for just about anything but a bucket of balls. Oh, wait. Scratch that. Tim Fortugno, a minor league pitcher, was sent from the Reno Silver Sox to the Stockton Brewers in 1989 for $2,500 and some baseballs. “I told them to throw in 12 dozen balls and we had a deal,” Jack Patton, the Silver Sox general manager, told The Los Angeles Times.","Other legendary baseball swaps: Cy Young in 1890 for a new suit, and Ken Krahenbuhl in 1998 for catfish. Not Catfish Hunter, but 10 pounds of actual catfish.","Teams have traded for coaches, including Jon Gruden, Lou Piniella, Doc Rivers and Bill Belichick. They have even traded for announcers: Ernie Harwell cost the Brooklyn Dodgers a player, Cliff Dapper, in 1948.","Sometimes a player is traded for a player to be named later. In the case of Harry Chiti of the Indians in 1962, the player to be named later turned out to be Harry Chiti.","In international soccer, trades are more unusual, but it’s not uncommon for smaller teams to ask bigger teams to agree to a lucrative friendly game as a part of a transfer deal.","Forget three-team trades. There have been four-team trades, including the one in the N.B.A. that sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012. There has even been a five-team trade, a 13-player blockbuster in 2005 that sent Antoine Walker to the Miami Heat.","One of the more memorable trades of recent years never actually happened. During a Mets home game in 2015, word reached the dugout and the many fans with smartphones that Wilmer Flores was being traded. Flores continued to play in the game, and the clued-in fans cheered the player in his “final” game as a Met. Flores was seen with tears in his eyes.","Only the deal fell through. Flores remained a Met, and he quickly went from fan favorite to beloved Met hero for the next three years. (He was released in November.)",Perhaps the strangest trade of all took place in 1979. The Philadelphia 76ers sent Harvey Catchings and Ralph Simpson to the Nets for Eric Money and Al Skinner.,"So what’s unusual? No, it’s not that Simpson’s daughter is the singer India Arie.","The two teams had played each other in November, with the 76ers winning in double overtime. But the Nets protested the game, arguing that a number of technical fouls had been called improperly. The commissioner agreed and ordered the last part of the game to be replayed. The replay was scheduled for March.",But by then the trade had taken place. Now four players were on different teams than when the game began.,"Sure enough, the final box score credits Money with 23 points for the Nets and 4 for the Sixers. Catchings and Simpson also played for both teams in the game.",That’s a story that’s going to be hard to beat. Remember those four players who were traded in the middle of the third quarter?

"A Sports Hijab Has France Debating the Muslim Veil, Again - The New York Times","PARIS — Plans by a major sporting goods company in France to sell a hijab designed for runners have incited yet another debate over what Muslim women wear, exposing once again the tensions between secularism and religion in the country.","France’s longstanding attitudes toward feminism, secularism and the integration of immigrants are at the root of the many controversies, but they are also fueled by recent fears about Islamist terrorism, along with the rise of social media.","The most recent debate centers on plans by Decathlon, Europe’s largest sporting goods retailer, to sell the hijab, which covers the wearer’s head and neck. Criticism quickly came from many quarters, with one lawmaker saying that the debate laid bare “this obsession around the veil and Islam.”","Decathlon had started selling the sports hijab in Morocco last week and planned to do so in France. The move was quickly criticized on social media, and several politicians expressed discomfort about the product being sold in France. ",Some even suggested a boycott.,"“My choice as a woman and a citizen will be to no longer trust a brand that breaks with our values,” said Aurore Bergé, a spokeswoman for Republic on the Move, President Emmanuel Macron’s party. “Those who tolerate women in the public space only when they are hiding are not lovers of freedom.”","Decathlon initially stood firm, arguing that it was focused on “democratizing” sports and that Muslim women often ran with “ill-adapted” hijabs.","“Our goal is simple: to offer them a suitable sports product, without judging,” the company said in a statement on Twitter.","It’s unclear why Decathlon became the focus of such criticism. Nike already sells hijabs for runners in France, but it has not faced the same scrutiny, possibly because it’s not a French brand. ","Some politicians defended Decathlon, with Aurélien Taché, a representative from Mr. Macron’s party, saying that France “would do well” without “this obsession around the veil and Islam.”","But Decathlon backtracked and on Tuesday, halting its plans to sell the sports hijab in France after — it said — salespeople were threatened in stores, some physically, and after it received hundreds of calls and emails.","One message accused the company of “betraying” France and “contributing to the Islamist invasion,” the company said.","Since 2011, it has been illegal to wear a face-covering veil in public in France, but the hijab does not fall into that category. ","Still, in recent years, Muslim women wearing the hijab and other garments have prompted friction — locally and on a national scale.","Last year, Maryam Pougetoux, a student union leader drew public ire after appearing on television wearing a head scarf.","In the summer of 2016, a nationwide debate erupted over the “burkini,” the full-body bathing suit designed for practicing Muslim women; the item was briefly banned in some coastal towns in southern France.","In some cases, other pieces of clothing have become the target of critics. In 2015, a French school sent a 15-year-old student home, saying that her long skirt was an “ostentatious sign” of her Muslim faith."," Since 2004, it has been illegal for students to wear any visible signs of religious affiliation.","Laïcité, the concept of state secularism, is a defining principle of the French republic, but it has often been a point of friction between Muslims and the state."," “France is a very secular society, which can be very virulent against any kind of religious expression, even those that are legal or do not threaten public order,” said Nicolas Cadène, a senior member of the Observatory of Secularism, an agency that assists the government in enforcing laïcité. ",The European Union’s highest court ruled in 2017 that employer bans on hijabs in the private sector could be legal. ,"But the debate about the veil is no longer about its legality, but rather its symbolism. ","On the right and far right, it is often seen as a rebuke of France’s secular values and a sign of a lack of integration. Across the political spectrum, the veil is often seen as an intrinsic symbol of submission that goes against gender equality, even when worn freely. ",Some feminists say that wearing it sends the wrong signal to women elsewhere in the world who are fighting to live without it.,"Marlène Schiappa, the junior minister for gender equality, wrote in The HuffPost on Wednesday that women should be allowed to wear the hijab, but that it was necessary to “question that choice.”","But others feminists and politicians on the left, as well as Muslim advocacy groups, argue that it is hypocritical to say hijab-wearing women are withdrawing from French society while criticizing garments like the burkini or sports hijabs designed to help them feel comfortable in public life.","Sylvie Eberena, 38, a Muslim entrepreneur and coach who runs a fitness website, said she found the discussions over attire “exhausting.”","“It’s not about politics or religion,” she said. “Every human being wants to feel good within their own bodies, so if a piece of clothing can help with that, why not?”","Since she began appearing in fitness videos wearing her hijab nearly a decade ago, Ms. Eberena said, she has seen many more veiled women practicing sports.","Laura Cha, a spokeswoman for the Muslim feminist organization Lallab, added that “for those who are not directly impacted by the hijab, it’s just one more controversy, but for Muslim women, it has some nefarious, long-lasting consequences.”","“It’s a shame that Decathlon didn’t stand firm,” Laetitia Gahoudi, 37, a Muslim entrepreneur and personal trainer, said on Wednesday.", “But we didn’t wait for Decathlon to sell a runner’s hijab to work out with our head scarves. And we will keep working out without them.”
"Thinking of a Jumbotron Proposal? Some Say, Ugh. Others, Say Yes. - The New York Times",Jumbotron proposals have become as much a part of baseball as the seventh-inning stretch — no matter that they are often considered tacky and in bad taste.,"When a proposal appears on the giant screen, a large segment of sports Twitter world (mostly women) chime in about how they hope no one ever proposes to them at a sporting event. Still, hundreds of these public, grandiose gestures happen every year and many proposees walk out of the stadium happily ever after.","On March 31, 2018, Joanna Chan, who works for Netflix, proposed to her girlfriend of five years, Julie Morris, who is employed at Hulu. The moment happened during the first period of a Calgary Flames game and was shown on the giant screen at Scotiabank Saddledome — known as the Enmax Energy Board — home to the National Hockey League’s Flames.","Ms. Chan and Ms. Morris, both 36 and living in Los Angeles (since married and now both going by Chan-Morris), had just embarked on a five-year tour of all 31 N.H.L. arenas, and the Saddledome was their final stop.","Joanna Chan-Morris says that a few stops before their final one, she knew she wanted to propose in Calgary. “It’s not about the public aspect of the proposal, really,” she said. “It was really just about making that last game special.”","Even still, with that gesture, their engagement became a viral sensation, traveling beyond the area and onto the internet. Joanna paid 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,782) for the opportunity, which she says was “worth every penny.”","The Saddledome is far from the only sports arena that gives fans the option to propose on a really big TV screen in front of thousands. Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, does 50 to 60 live, in-game proposals each season at a cost of $350 each. At Dodger Stadium, getting engaged onscreen will set you back $5,000, an event the team estimates happens two or three times a season.","The National Basketball Association’s Atlanta Hawks do several proposals a season, and the New York Knicks have a $500 proposal package for purchase. The Knicks have had “seven completed proposals so far this season,” the team said, and the package includes a split screen with video of the proposal on one side and your written message (“So-and-so, will you marry me?”) on the other. Most teams request that the payment come in the form of a donation to the team’s charity. Some sports organizations, though, like the Boston Celtics, don’t provide the option to propose on their giant screen at all.","Even though sports fans come from all genders, there’s an assumption that mostly men will be viewing the proposal, including the players. “Sports stadiums are not gender-neutral territory,” said Dr. Leslie Bell, the author of “Hard to Get: Twenty-Something Women and the Paradox of Sexual Freedom” (University of California Press, 2018). Just like rooting for your favorite team to win, she said, a woman saying yes to a proposal can be viewed as a sort of victory.","The whole concept irks Jessica Kleinschmidt, a content producer/reporter at NBC Sports Bay Area and a self-proclaimed “hater of in-game proposals.”","“It’s as if this person needs to show these complete strangers they love this person by making a show out of it,” Ms. Kleinschmidt said. “Needing validation from complete strangers? Go on Twitter if you want to do that.”","Also, she noted, an in-game proposal “puts the woman under pressure to say yes.”","When those traditional gender dynamics are reversed, the public response can be cruel.","In 2014, a woman surprised her boyfriend by proposing to him at an N.B.A. game. At the time, she told Fox 5 DC, “I thought this would make me the best wife-to-be ever to do it in front of his favorite team.” Her fiancé seemed happy she asked. But the response online was less than kind, with the frequently misogynist sports and culture website Barstool Sports calling it “the absolute worst proposal of all time,” among other worse things. Another blogger wrote that he would “never want to be proposed to by my girlfriend, and at an N.B.A. game no less, not in a million years.”","When Jumbotron proposals go wrong, spectators take an almost perverse pleasure in the rejection. In 2017, a rejected proposal at Fenway Park resulted in the entire ballpark chanting, “She said no!” (Jasmine Guillory’s newest novel, aptly named “The Proposal,” opens with a rejected proposal at Dodger Stadium that goes viral on the internet.)","This virality is something that more and more Jumbotron proposers are experiencing now that social media is a thing and everyone in the stadium has a smartphone, or the teams broadcast feel-good content across their various platforms.","What is it about our culture’s ideas about love, romance and marriage that allowed the phenomenon to gain traction in the first place? “Romantic comedies,” Chloe Angyal wrote for Buzzfeed in 2015, “teach us that the truer a true love is, the grander and more public the public grand gesture will be.”","It’s hard to know when the gimmick originated, but it had to be sometime after video screens were installed in stadiums; Dodger Stadium was among the first, in 1980. But the technology has given rise to an entire industry of what Laurie Essig, the author of “Love, Inc.: Dating Apps, the Big White Wedding, and Chasing the Happily Neverafter” (University of California Press, 2019) calls “spectacular proposals.”","Jumbotron proposals are, of course, grandiose gestures, broadcasting love and commitment onto a giant screen for tens of thousands, and now, with the advent of social media, millions of eyes to consume. They are larger than life. “I just thought it would make it that much more special,” to put it on the Jumbotron instead of just proposing in the concourse, said Tyler Garrison, 40, who proposed to his now-husband, Ty Fleming, at Nationals Park in 2017. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Fleming, 35, live in Washington and are season ticket holders, which is why Mr. Garrison says he thought the big proposal would be “creating a special moment that we can have for the rest of our lives.”","Mr. Garrison never imagined that the moment would be viewed millions of times across the internet. He had planned the proposal with help from a friend, Robert York, a board member of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit athletic advocacy group. It was one of the first same-sex marriage proposals on a screen at a Major League Baseball game.","When the Chan-Morrises got engaged in Calgary last year, Joanna says the team was initially concerned that her request was a prank or a desire to make a political statement. But after she persuaded them that she just wanted to get engaged — something a straight couple would almost never have to prove — the moment was one of the most touching Jumbotron proposals in recent memory. It similarly went viral, and the response was mostly enthusiastic.",Responses to these same sex engagements were overwhelmingly positive perhaps because they run contrary to who typically gets engaged at sporting events.,"But heartwarming feedback is not always the case. Marlyn Sanchez said she made the mistake of reading the comments under the YouTube video of her proposal at Marlins Park last year, and “people were so mean.” Ms. Sanchez, a 37-year-old curriculum support specialist for Miami-Dade County Public Schools and also a singer, had sung the national anthem at the ballpark before, which gave her now-fiancé, Rafael Cabrera, an “in” with the team. She was contacted and asked to come back and perform, and to throw the first pitch. Unbeknown to her, the person who caught the ball was Mr. Cabrera. He walked over, got down on one knee, and proposed. (The two plan to marry in May.)","Commenters joked that, because of the low attendance at Miami Marlins games, it appeared like Mr. Cabrera had rented out the entire stadium for her. Other people jabbed that it must have taken guts to propose in front of tens of people.","Mr. Cabrera, 35, was a former minor league ballplayer, and even though Ms. Sanchez says she isn’t necessarily a Marlins fan, the proposal was perfect because it was “totally him.” Even though they had never talked about the idea of public proposals, Ms. Sanchez says Mr. Cabrera would always say to her: “Don’t even give me any hints of what you want, because I’m gonna do it in my own way and that’s that.”","Although Ms. Sanchez says she has “thick skin” when it comes to criticism, in part because she’s a performer, getting engaged in such a public way invites feedback from viewers that not everyone will take in stride the way she did.","But for Julie Chan-Morris, when Joanna proposed to her in front of nearly 20,000 people in the Saddledome, she says it was surprisingly intimate. “It sounds crazy because there was so many people who were in attendance at the Saddledome that night,” she said, “but it was as if it was just us for a moment.”","She also understands the criticism levied at people who get engaged on Jumbotrons. “I think that, honestly, had Joanna just randomly done a public proposal,” Julie said, “I don’t think I would’ve been into it. But it was completely justified because of where we were,” with the arena tour."
"Michigan State Discouraged Reporting of Rape Allegation Against Athletes, Woman Says - The New York Times","Robin and David Kowalski barely recognized their daughter Bailey when she was visiting home in White Lake, Mich., in the spring of 2015.","Their perennially positive daughter, who was about to finish her freshman year at Michigan State, was sullen. She had suddenly decided to abandon her long-held dream of being a sports journalist, and she refused to tell her mother, in whom she typically confided everything, why.","It was not until October, after months of erratic behavior, that Ms. Kowalski told her parents that she had been raped by three Michigan State basketball players that April. The incident left her depressed and considering harming herself. She dropped out of college for a while and received counseling. She gave up sports journalism for good.","Last year, Ms. Kowalski, 22, who is speaking publicly about her case for the first time, sued Michigan State in federal court for violating her rights under Title IX, the federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, as a Jane Doe. The lawsuit asserts that Michigan State mishandles sexual misconduct complaints against athletes. One woman said two football players raped her in 2009, but she was not advised of her Title IX rights, the lawsuit said, and another woman said three basketball players raped her in 2010, after which the accusations were not reported outside the athletic department.","A Michigan State motion to dismiss the case is pending. A university spokeswoman, Emily Guerrant, declined to comment on the case while the litigation is ongoing but said Michigan State “is dedicated to making sure every student receives fair treatment and support when they need it.”","Ms. Kowalski has decided to come forward, hoping she can persuade other victims, at Michigan State or elsewhere, to tell their stories.","According to Ms. Kowalski, when a university counselor learned that the men who she said assailed her were members of the basketball team — a storied and treasured program that has played in 10 Final Fours, including this year’s — the counselor discouraged her from reporting it, the lawsuit said.","“If you pursue this, you are going to be swimming with some really big fish,” a staff member told Ms. Kowalski, the lawsuit said.","Ms. Kowalski plans to hold a news conference in East Lansing on Thursday, the fourth anniversary of the incident. A month later, she will graduate from Michigan State.","“I don’t want any other girl who has gone through this or who God forbid may have to go through something like this to feel for one second that they should be too afraid to come out and do something,” Ms. Kowalski said in a phone interview last week.","Her lawyer, Karen Truszkowski, said that a separate Title IX investigation initiated by the university last June had dragged on.","“It will not be resolved within a year,” said Ms. Truszkowski, who declined to discuss the substance of the investigation because it is pending. “That has consumed her entire senior year.”","Ms. Kowalski is still declining to name the men she says raped her on the night of April 11, 2015. All were members of the 2014-15 Spartans team, she said. She has not filed a police report, but is considering doing so.","It’s still unclear to Ms. Kowalski who at Michigan State eventually learned about what she told the counselor. “I still to this day don’t know who knew,” she said. “How far up. Who was the last person to know about what I told the counselor in the counseling center the day I went in?”","More than a year ago, Michigan State’s president and athletic director resigned after the depredations of Lawrence G. Nassar, the former university doctor who has been accused of sexual abuse by hundreds of women, including Olympic gymnasts, and convicted of sex crimes, became a source of national outrage.","Also last winter, ESPN reported several previously undisclosed sexual misconduct allegations against members of Michigan State’s football and men’s basketball programs. In several instances, ESPN said, the accusations were handled by the athletics program, rather than the venues mandated by federal law.","“There’s a lot that they have yet to take accountability for, as far as what’s going on in the athletic department and the systematic errors that are allowing the athletic department to be put above females that have been victims of sexual assault by athletes,” Ms. Kowalski said.","The lawsuit states that the sexual assault occurred in April 2015 after an informal celebration at an East Lansing bar for the basketball team, which had recently returned from the Final Four in Indianapolis, where it lost to the eventual champion, Duke, in the national semifinals. (Ms. Kowalski, days away from turning 19, said she used fake identification to enter the bar.)",Ms. Kowalski’s roommate encouraged her to approach the players.,"“I knew their stats, numbers, everything,” Ms. Kowalski said, adding, “She knew how I looked up to those guys.”","A team member invited Ms. Kowalski to his place for a party, and she accepted a drive to an off-campus apartment, the lawsuit said. When she arrived, there was no one else there, and Ms. Kowalski, who had already had trouble holding her glass at the bar despite not drinking much, had trouble controlling her thumbs to send a text, the lawsuit said.","The three players took turns raping her, the lawsuit said. She woke up later in the apartment and took a taxi back to her dorm.","Ms. Kowalski visited the Michigan State University Counseling Center roughly a week later, she said. The counselor she met with appeared to change her response to Ms. Kowalski upon learning that the men she said had attacked her were members of the basketball team. The counselor immediately insisted on having a second person in the room, the lawsuit said. Ms. Kowalski was not advised to seek a physical exam or pregnancy or S.T.D. testing, and was not made aware of her rights under Title IX.","With cases with “guys with big names,” she was told, according to the lawsuit, the best thing was to “just get yourself better.”","“She lived with that thought of, ‘Just get yourself better,’” said her mother, Robin Kowalski, in a phone interview last week.","When Bailey Kowalski first sued Michigan State last spring, the university rebutted her claims in a statement with significant and unusual detail. “We have not found any evidence or indication that she was discouraged in any way to make a Title IX complaint or a complaint to the police department,” it said. It also said that the university police eventually contacted her.","A day later, Michigan State’s former interim president, John Engler, said in a statement, “We regret that we provided an unnecessary amount of detail” in the initial response.","“They went out to the press and essentially addressed my lawsuit as a lie,” Ms. Kowalski said, “which basically was a message to anyone else coming forward with allegations similar to mine that, ‘If you’re going to do that, we’re going to completely exploit you.’”","After taking much of a semester off and receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment, Ms. Kowalski elected to return to Michigan State, believing that transferring to an unknown campus where she did not know anyone would have been worse. Her brother is currently a sophomore at Michigan State.","She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, she said, and felt she could never return to the vocation to which she had long aspired. She switched from a planned double-major in journalism and Spanish to one in biology. She hopes eventually to become a veterinarian."
Soccer Player’s Detention Poses ‘Historic Test’ for Global Sports - The New York Times,"BANGKOK — The global sports market is worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Now, this powerful industry is coming together to promote an unlikely cause: human rights.","Since late November, a Bahrain-born soccer player for a minor team in Australia has been held in detention in Thailand. The player, Hakeem al-Araibi, 24, is not a famous athlete. He has no lucrative sponsors.","But he has spoken out against one of the most powerful men in international soccer, who is also a member of the ruling family of Bahrain. His testimony of torture at the hands of Bahrain’s repressive government earned him refugee status in Australia, which determined that he faced credible threats of persecution should he return to the Gulf state.","Still, over the past week, Mr. Araibi has collected an impressive list of supporters in the world of international sports.","Fatma Samoura, the secretary general of FIFA, the international body governing global soccer, has called for Thailand to return him to Australia “as a matter of urgency.” So has Thomas Bach, the head of the International Olympic Committee, who raised the issue with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.","On Tuesday, Praful Patel, a vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, issued a statement asking Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand to ensure Mr. Araibi’s return to his adopted home.","The head of the Asian Football Confederation is Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini official whom Mr. Araibi accused of not stopping the persecution of athletes in his charge. Sheikh Salman also serves as a FIFA vice president.","Such a collection of statements of support is rare, said Mary Harvey, the chief executive of the Center for Sports and Human Rights, which assembles governments, sports bodies, corporate sponsors and nongovernmental groups to ensure the role of human rights in sports.","“Hakeem is a historic test case, because it’s the first time that we’ve seen these big, powerful sports bodies all come together publicly to address the fate of a single person,” said Ms. Harvey, who was a member of the United States national soccer team and a FIFA executive.","Sports has been buffeted by growing concerns about the hidden human costs of mega-events, like the Olympics and the World Cup, that have been used to bring international glory to authoritarian governments. Hundreds of foreign laborers, mainly from South Asia, have died in the building of stadiums and other infrastructure for the 2022 men’s soccer World Cup in Qatar, according to the International Trade Union Confederation.","Although the Qatari government has pledged to improve the rights of its migrant work force, some construction workers and foreign athletes continue to work in what is essentially indentured servitude, human-rights monitors say.","Last year’s hosting of the men’s soccer World Cup by Russia was marred by racism and homophobia controversies. Both bids for the World Cup by Qatar and Russia were tarnished by a series of corruption scandals that cleared out a significant portion of FIFA’s leadership ranks. With corporate sponsors nervous about a backlash from sports fans, FIFA unveiled a series of reforms aimed at bettering its human rights.","In January, Brendan Schwab, the executive director of the World Players Association, which represents 85,000 professional athletes worldwide, wrote an urgent legal request on the “severe violation of the human rights” of Mr. Araibi, which was submitted to FIFA. The brief was also signed by unions representing professional soccer players.","“Hakeem’s case is about a football player, it’s about a human-rights defender, it’s about a refugee and it’s about global sport’s ability to uphold its stated commitment to human rights,” Mr. Schwab said.","Although FIFA now has binding human-rights policies, they are largely untested. Even though FIFA’s human rights advisory board was formed two years ago, the request on Mr. Araibi’s behalf was the first time such a formal submission had been made.","When Mr. Araibi traveled to Bangkok on Nov. 27 with his wife for a belated honeymoon, the Thai authorities were waiting for him at the airport.","Initially, Thai officials said Mr. Araibi had been detained based on an Interpol request alerting the immigration authorities to fugitives of justice. But Interpol quickly lifted that request because such alerts, called red notices, are not supposed to apply to refugees.","Nevertheless, Bahrain has formally asked Thailand for Mr. Araibi’s extradition so he can return to face a 10-year prison sentence for a conviction in absentia on charges that he burned a police station, among other convictions.","Last week, the extradition request was passed on to the Thai attorney general’s office, said Busadee Santipitaks, a spokeswoman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meaning that Mr. Araibi’s fate could be decided in a matter of days.","Mr. Araibi was playing in a televised football match when the police station he was supposed to have attacked was burned. Bahrain has racked up thousands of questionable convictions related to its crushing of its Arab Spring movement in 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis joined street protests, human rights groups say.","Thailand, which has not signed an international convention on refugees, has a history of extraditing human rights defenders to countries they have fled, like China or Bahrain, where they are likely to face imprisonment or torture.","In early January, however, a Saudi teenager who had flown to Bangkok and feared death from her family, avoided deportation and was eventually allowed to travel on to Canada, where she was granted asylum. Her release followed an outcry on social media.","In 2016, Sheikh Salman, who has refused to answer questions about Mr. Araibi’s detention in Thailand, ran for the FIFA presidency. But his front-runner status diminished in part because of questions raised about Bahrain’s record of imprisoning protesters, including members of the national soccer team.","Instead, Gianni Infantino, who was born in Switzerland, won the top job. Both Mr. Infantino and Sheikh Salman are up for re-election to their respective posts this year.","Running for the first time for a vice-presidential post in the Asian Football Confederation is Somyot Poompanmoung, the leader of the Football Association of Thailand. A former national police chief, Mr. Somyot faced a scandal last year after it emerged that he had received large loans from a fugitive brothel owner implicated in human trafficking.","Thailand has mulled the possibility of jointly bidding for the World Cup in 2034 with another Southeast Asian nation. After the tainted bids by Russia and Qatar, updated FIFA guidelines now require that human rights be considered as a factor in deciding which country wins the right to host the prestigious tournament.","“Sports, like the Olympics and football, should and can bring social change,” said Craig Foster, a former captain of the Australian national soccer team who has lobbied on Mr. Araibi’s behalf.","“We’ve got to hold governments accountable and say, ‘If you want the great honor of hosting these major sports tournaments, then you have to accept global human rights standards,’” he said."
Short Pants and Long Sleeves: China’s Soccer Team Plays Under Tattoo Ban - The New York Times,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — China’s recent attempts to emerge as a serious soccer nation after decades in the sports wilderness have taken some curious turns. One of the more recent ones is visible — or, rather, invisible — at this month’s Asian Cup.","Temperatures in the tournament, which is being played in the United Arab Emirates, can be stifling, making the sight of some Chinese players wearing long-sleeved undershirts beneath their jerseys seem puzzling.","The answer lies in a semiofficial edict from Chinese sports officials issued last year that bans tattoos from being visible during matches. The directive applies to the national team but also to Chinese players in domestic competitions, like the Chinese Super League.","Soccer is now a national priority under President Xi Jinping, and China’s soccer authorities expect the country’s best players to promote positive values to the next generation of athletes and their parents, some of whom remain wary of allowing their children to play a sport they consider to be dangerous or, worse, frivolous. In many ways, the no-tattoos rule is a microcosm of the never-ending wrestling match that China’s central government conducts with its sometimes-dueling allegiances to modernity and control.","The rule can be more onerous for some players than for others. Take the heavily inked central defender Zhang Linpeng. Most of his body, including the entirety of both arms, is heavily tattooed. He has been playing with a compression shirt underneath his national team jersey at the Asian Cup, though he has avoided covering the markings on his right leg and his neck.","Other players have less work to do; a tattooed back or calf is often covered by a player’s uniform, while a smaller bit of artwork can be hidden under athletic tape. (Zhang and others have managed to get some respite: Covering tattoos isn’t mandatory for training sessions.)","The Chinese soccer federation and tournament organizers clearly do not want to talk about the issue, however. At a news conference before a game with South Korea this week that will decide top spot in Group C, a tournament official tried to shut down a question about the tattoos before the Chinese national team coach, Marcello Lippi of Italy, could answer it.","After it was rephrased, Lippi gave a short, diplomatic response, saying he was not unduly concerned by the edict. The team’s captain, Zheng Zhi, sitting to Lippi’s right, stifled a laugh but declined to comment on the issue.","“This is only a detail; I don’t really want to talk about this,” Lippi said through a translator.","A few months before the ink ban was imposed on Chinese soccer players, television stars faced similar restrictions as part of government efforts to control what viewers were being exposed to in the media. The soccer rules were brought in so quickly, though, that some clubs simply chose to heavily bandage their players before they took the field.","The tattoo ban has become a lively topic on Chinese social media. Many people in China appear to support the official view that the players are public figures and should act accordingly. Others have ridiculed the move, which is at odds with a current trend in Western sports, where elaborate tattoos are now as commonplace as cleats and jerseys. Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the Los Angeles Galaxy is covered by them; Barcelona’s Lionel Messi now has a long sleeve of art on his right arm and another on his left leg.","Zhang, a defender considered one of China’s best players, did not play in two national-team matches after the tattoo ban was established in March. The official reason was injury, but angry fans speculated on social media that China had been thrashed in matches against Wales and the Czech Republic because it was forced to play without Zhang, who they suspected had been benched because of his body art.","China has been pumping millions of dollars into soccer since 2015. A sleepy national league is now backed by some of the country’s biggest companies, whose lavish spending quickly attracted world-class coaches and players in search of some of the biggest paydays in the sport. A more intense focus is on creating a national team capable of transforming itself from a punch line into a force that can compete with the best in Asia and, eventually, against the best in the world.","The road to get there has been bumpy, though, with soccer officials, typically political figures, chopping and changing policy, or introducing rules that some have found hard to follow.","Last year, for example, top clubs were taken by surprise when the Chinese Football Association suddenly announced the best young players would be pulled from their club teams midseason and sent for military training, a practice that China has used with top athletes in other sports. Images of players with freshly shaved heads being put through drills by specialty trainers were beamed around the country.",The effects on some teams were significant. Dalian Yifang F.C. lost four straight games and was pulled toward relegation after three of its young starters were called up.,It is unlikely the best young players will be going back to their clubs anytime soon. Plans have been announced to create a team composed of young Chinese to play in the second division for a team recently created by a university in Beijing. The team could function as a kind of second national team.,"China’s men’s national team has not played in a World Cup since its first appearance in 2002, when it lost all three of its games. Its leaders have targeted hosting the event in 2030, and winning it by 2050. To do that, Xi has set a target for 20,000 training centers and 70,000 soccer fields to be established by 2020.","The efforts are immediately visible. Private soccer schools have mushroomed in the major cities, and European coaches of varying abilities are being recruited at staggering rates.","Lippi, who won the World Cup as Italy’s manager in 2006, has seen much of it. He moved to China in 2012 to run the big-spending club Guangzhou Evergrande, and has announced that he will step down as national coach after the Asian Cup. He has stressed a focus on youth development as a path to China’s soccer goals.","“Six years ago in China there were not so many young players,” he said. “This is the only way if you want to become stronger in the future. China has to continue to work in this direction.”","Regardless of how fast it improves, however, don’t be surprised to see some players turning up in long sleeves on the way there."
Kyler Murray Knows His Options. That’s Why This Isn’t Simple. - The New York Times,"Millennials were the first generation to make multitasking a religion. Hovered over by helicopter parents, they — we — were encouraged to see no ceiling to our potential and no limits to our options as we were ferried among school, basketball practice, piano lessons, test-prep tutoring and group outings to the movies.","“It’s not the stick that drives them on, it’s the carrot,” David Brooks wrote of the oldest millennials, who were college students in 2001. “Opportunity lures them.”","But that, it turns out, was child’s play. Kyler Murray, born in 1997 — making him either an extremely young millennial or a member of the emerging Generation Z — was already set to go from Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback of Oklahoma, a major-conference champion, to budding star outfielder for the Oakland Athletics.","Murray added a further twist Monday, though, when he announced — how? on Twitter, of course! — that contrary to expectations he would enter the N.F.L. draft, despite having received a $4.66 million signing bonus with the A’s last year. He had been selected with the ninth overall pick in the Major League Baseball draft on the understanding that this past season would be his last on the gridiron.","“I’ve always felt like I could play in the N.F.L.,” Murray said last month. “I’m a confident guy.”",He added of football: “I’ve played this game my whole life and I’ve always felt like I could do it.”,"There are many ways Murray’s pre-professional saga could conclude, and it is not at all certain that he will ever suit up for an N.F.L. team. The league combine is next month; whether Murray shows up will tell us more about his true intentions. (It will also tell us more about his true height, which Oklahoma lists at an already-short-for-an-N.F.L. quarterback 5 feet 10 inches.)","Murray and his representatives met with the A’s and a league representative on Sunday, according to a source with knowledge of the talks, where it was established that the A’s could offer him a larger, major-league contract. Murray entered the draft in order to learn more what N.F.L. front offices think of him, the source said.","Late last year, Murray and his baseball agent, Scott Boras, insisted that the plan was for Murray to play one season as Oklahoma’s starter and then report to spring training for the Athletics. Such a deal was apparently part of the negotiating process that led to Murray’s baseball contract, and was outlined in a news conference last spring with A’s executives.","Still, that Murray would even entertain the possibility of playing both big league baseball and quarterback on Sundays — or would be so self-assured of his talents as to make leveraging one against the other a plausible ploy — is something new in American sports.","When Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders were two-sport stars two decades ago, they were a running back and a cornerback. Those are difference-making positions, but quarterback they are not.","And in 1994, after Charlie Ward won the Heisman playing quarterback at Florida State, he said he would turn to basketball unless he was picked in the N.F.L. draft’s first round. When he was not, he embarked on a decade-long career in the N.B.A., mostly with the Knicks.",The differences between the two pastimes must have seemed blurrier then. Free agency was only dawning in the N.F.L. Many revelations concerning the toll of repeated hits to the head were still years into the future.,"Nowadays, we know how dangerous football can be. But we also know that young baseball players face many years of some combination of playing in the minor leagues and making lowish salaries under team control before hitting an ostensibly open market into which franchises are seemingly pouring less money every year. All this while franchise quarterbacks sign deals worth $30 million a year after finishing rookie contracts that are not exactly ungenerous.","Football versus baseball, in other words, is not the obvious, clear-cut decision that some might have once thought it was.","It is conceivable that Murray will not have to choose. He is frequently projected as a first-round N.F.L. draft pick, and already was one in baseball. First-round picks are among the most valuable assets in both leagues, and no team in either would knowingly waste one by using it on someone with no intention of trying to live up to it.","Either way, Murray has already transcended the team-first ethos of both sports, exploiting his moment of utmost possibility for all it is worth. This might be the ultimate millennial move: always, always play your cards optimally, and you will maximize your accomplishments.","Then again, an older person — even an older millennial — might point out that money, fame and glamour are worth only so much. In the long run, we are all running on a treadmill no matter how fast our 40-yard dash is.","This much we know for sure: should he not withdraw his entry into the N.F.L. draft, he will irrevocably give up his final season of eligibility in college football.","That is a wholly understandable decision. In college, the pay is lousy, and there is a definite sense that real life is still a thing in the future. But as many a proud alum knows, college can be the best, and real life can be overrated."
"In Science, as in Sports, the Sidelines Matter - The New York Times",Welcome to the hot stove science league.,"On Thursday, with great fanfare, officials from the U.S. National Science Foundation and U.K. Research and Innovation announced a $30 million project to double the sensitivity of the antennas for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which stunned the world three years ago by detecting space-time ripples from colliding black holes.","Only the day before, NASA had announced the selection of its newest astronomy mission: a satellite that will map the entire sky, including millions of galaxies, stars and planets, in three dimensions and 96 colors. The two-year mission, called SPHEREx (short for, hold on, the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer) will look for clues to the as-yet-unknown forces that propelled the Big Bang.","Neither announcement would be big news by itself. New projects are springing up all the time. The same week, NASA also announced the formation of a cross-disciplinary research network, the Prebiotic Chemistry and Early Earth Environments Consortium, to help guide future searches for life on other worlds. And last year, with serious fanfare, Congress passed and President Trump signed the National Quantum Initiative, designed to provide more money and organization into harnessing the most arcane science of quantum mechanics for computing and cryptography.",[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.],"The upgraded LIGO — Advanced LIGO Plus — won’t kick in until 2024 or so, although classic Advanced LIGO will be back online sometime this spring, on the prowl for whatever is out there. And NASA’s SPHEREx won’t be launched until 2023 or later.","But the close timing of the announcements is a reminder of an aspect of science that gets scant attention. Especially at Nobel Prize time, we applaud a few heroic Einsteins for their moments of inspiration and discovery. But much of the real action in science occurs on the sidelines, often years before any wizardry in the lab. Some of is performed by armies of people whose names are mostly unknown. Others are well-known politicians, like President John F. Kennedy declaring the moon shot in 1961, throwing their weight on the levers of history.","For many baseball fans, the most exciting part of the game is the so-called hot stove league, now in progress. Here the heroes are crafty general managers who wheel and deal, barter and sign and deploy their players like so many chess pieces. There was Branch Rickey, who integrated Major League Baseball by signing Jackie Robinson and putting him on first base for the Dodgers in 1947, but only after provoking him to make sure he would be strong enough to take the expected abuse without striking back. Recently Theo Epstein has become a front office legend by rebuilding the Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs.","It’s the same drama in most professional sports, as anyone who has followed the annual travails of the New York Knicks in their search for a franchise-changing draft pick or a free-agent superstar.","So, too, in the hot stove science league.","Future Nobel Prizes are won in congressional-committee hearing rooms and on august panels at the National Academy of Sciences, by budget-wielding bureaucrats. Without their efforts, there would be no labs or research grants. This is a point made emphatically by the well-known author Michael Lewis (“The Blind Side,” “Liar’s Poker,” “Moneyball”) in his latest book, “The Fifth Risk,” which tells stories of civil servants in bureaucracies like the Departments of Energy, Commerce and Agriculture working to keep the country’s nuclear arsenal and fleets of weather satellites in shape, and their travails under the Trump administration.","This summer the world will pay tribute to the Apollo 11 lunar landing 50 years ago, and to the bravery and skill of astronauts such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. But the man who did as much as anyone to put them up there was James Webb, NASA’s administrator from 1961 to 1968.","After a capsule fire killed three astronauts in 1967, Webb took charge of the investigation, setting a standard for the space agency’s warts-and-all frankness, and gave the go-ahead for Apollo 8’s dramatic moon mission during Christmas in 1968. He stepped down in October 1968 just before Richard Nixon’s election, but at least he will have a telescope named for him, the long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, when it finally launches, maybe in 2021.","Political, economic, bureaucratic, geographic and historic machinations now at work will determine where the next giant telescope or next big particle collider will be built. Laptop-toting physicists have been crisscrossing the oceans between Japan, China and Europe, for the last decade trying to cajole colleagues and their governments into pouring many billions of dollars into the future of physics. By the time particles start zinging around any such machine, many of these scientists will have retired.","As Frederick Bordry, CERN’s director of accelerators, said last year, “I’m working for the young people.”","Few people had ever heard of LIGO before February of 2016, when its astronomers announced that they had heard black holes dancing in the dark. The discovery knocked the world on its head, confirming for the first time the existence of gravitational waves, and of those dead pits of space-time, black holes. It also garnered a Nobel Prize for its originators and leaders, Rainer Weiss of M.I.T. and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology.","Of course, by then LIGO had been in the works for 30 years, and had already cost the National Science Foundation a billion dollars. Its success was a saga of persistence, ingenuity and just plain bravery in the face of nature and professional skepticism. The twin antennas — at Hanford, Wash., and Livingston, La. — are basically L-shaped tubes of vacuum, empty space. Inside them laser beams monitor the distance between two mirrors 2.5 miles apart, looking for a gravitational wave that will squeeze that distance by less than the diameter of a proton.","Convincing anybody that this scheme would work was no small or quick task. The LIGO team owes its Nobel Prize partly to skeptical physicists and astronomers (who didn’t like that a physics experiment was being called an “observatory”) who fought the project tooth and nail, holding its proponents’ feet to the fire in studies and workshops over and over, making them prove that it would work. On Feb. 10, 2016 the world got its answer when LIGO announced they had recorded the collision of a pair of black holes.","I sat next to one of those fierce critics, Richard Garwin, a distinguished, influential and well-connected physicist based at IBM, when the Nobel Prize announcement was celebrated at Columbia University. He was beaming with pleasure.",Branch Rickey would be proud.
Can Low-Impact Sports Like Cycling Be Putting Your Bones at Risk? - The New York Times,Could competitive cyclists be putting their bone health at risk?,"A disquieting new study of bone density in elite cyclists and runners suggests that the answer might be yes. The study found that the cyclists, both male and female, had thinner bones than the runners, even though all of the athletes were young, healthy and enviably fit, and many of the cyclists lifted weights.",The results underscore the divergent effects of various sports on our skeletons and also stir a little unease about the long-term impacts of pursuing low-impact exercise at the expense of more high-impact activities.,"By and large, the available scientific evidence shows that physical activity is desirable and even necessary for bone health. Children who run, hop and play develop thicker, stronger bones than those who remain sedentary, as do teenagers and young adults who participate in sports involving sprinting and leaping.","Most scientists agree that these kinds of activities build skeletal strength by generating sudden, sharp forces that minutely bow or deform the affected bones. Such activities jump-start processes within the body that increase the number of bone cells and help to prepare those parts of the skeleton to withstand similar forces in the future.","Even middle-aged and older people, who once were thought to face inevitable thinning of their bones with age, can maintain strong skeletons if they are sufficiently active, recent studies show.","But which types of exercise bend bones in a desirable way — and which are too gentle — remains uncertain. Some past studies suggest that running generates enough force to remodel bone, while other experiments with runners conclude the opposite. Ditto with weight training. And multiple studies have raised concerns about negligible or even adverse effects from non — weight-bearing exercises, such as cycling and swimming, which put little pressure on bones.","In hopes of gaining more clarity about sports and bones, researchers at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the Norwegian Olympic Training Center, in Oslo, decided to look closely at the skeletons of world-class, competitive cyclists and runners.","They focused on elite, full-time athletes in large part because the athletes’ heavy training could be expected to amplify any impacts from and differences between the two sports.","They wound up recruiting 21 high-level runners and 19 road cyclists, men and women, most of them in their 20s and all of them lean, fit and with several years of intense competition behind them.","The athletes reported to a lab, where scientists measured their body composition, with particular focus on the density of their bones, both over all and in their lower spines and the tops of their femurs — portions of the skeleton that can indicate general bone health.","The researchers also asked the athletes about their training, health and calcium intake and whether they spent much time in the gym. The latter question was of particular interest to the researchers, since weight training often is recommended to athletes in sports like cycling to bulk up their bones, as well as their muscles.","The scientists then compared data. Some of the differences between athletes were substantial, if expected. The cyclists trained far more than the runners, for instance, averaging about 900 hours a year in the saddle, versus about 500 annual hours on the road or treadmills for the runners.","The cyclists also did more weight training, with most of them heading to the gym during their off-season for intense lifting. None of the runners did that.",The athletes in both sports consumed enough calcium to meet their expected daily requirements.,But they had noticeably different bones.,"The cyclists, as a group, all had thinner bones than the runners, and more than half of them met medical criteria for low bone mineral density in some portion of their skeleton. One of the riders, a man, displayed clinical osteoporosis in his spine.","These results are potentially worrisome, says Oddbjorn Klomsten Andersen, a graduate student at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and a former national-team cyclist himself, who led the study, which was published in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine.","“There are limited studies following young cyclists through their careers,” he says. “But studies in master cyclists demonstrate that a larger proportion of them have low bone mineral density or osteoporosis” than people who do not cycle.","This study cannot tell us, though, why cyclists’ bones might be thin, he adds. They could have been eating too little or sweating too much for ideal bone health. Both low calorie intake and high rates of calcium loss through sweating have been tied to bone loss in other studies.","More surprising, the cyclists’ heavy weight training seems not to have built much bone.","But, as Mr. Andersen points out, this was a one-time snapshot of the athletes’ health. It’s possible, he says, that weight training prevented even greater bone thinning.","It is also encouraging, he says, that the runners harbored relatively healthy bones, since some past studies have hinted that running might not stimulate bone building.","Over all, the study’s findings suggest that serious cyclists might want to consider at least sometimes branching out, Mr. Andersen says.","“I would generally recommend combining cycling with weight-bearing exercise to promote good bone health,” he says."
The Fight for Gender Equality in One of the Most Dangerous Sports on Earth - The New York Times
Get Ready for Olympic Break Dancing - The New York Times,"The archetype of the Olympian is evolving, as evidenced by the potential arrival of a new sort of athletic competitor at the Summer Games: B-boys and B-girls.","As part of an effort to appeal to younger fans, the organizing committee for the 2024 Games in Paris announced on Thursday that it would recommend break dancing — yes, the street dance form with moves like flares, headspins and windmills — as a new sport to be added to its program.","The proposal — which also includes a recommendation that skateboarding, surfing and climbing, which will be introduced next year at the Tokyo Games, remain on the program — will be formally presented to the International Olympic Committee executive board at the end of March. The I.O.C. is not expected to confirm the events program for the 2024 Games until December 2020.","Break dancing was enthusiastically received when it made its debut at the Youth Olympic Games last summer in Buenos Aires. The eventual medalists there hailed from Russia, France, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Italy, Austria, Vietnam and Argentina — a vivid sign perhaps of how extensively the activity has spread since its beginnings decades ago in New York City.","“Breaking has two elements,” Nakari Shigeyuki, a Japanese teenager known as Shigekix who won a bronze medal at the Youth event, told Olympic.org in October. “One is sports, and one is arts. We need the stamina of athletes, but we also need to be artists, and express our feelings.”",The sport’s potential moment in the global spotlight arrives as the I.O.C. continues its efforts to engage new fans — particularly young ones — in a sports landscape flowering with alternatives to the traditional Olympic program.,"To that end, the I.O.C. created new rules recently to allow host cities to recommend new sports for the Olympics program. Organizers for the 2020 Games in Toyko proposed baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, which the I.O.C. eventually approved. (Because host city recommendations are valid for one Olympic Games only, karate and baseball/softball will not return in Paris.)","Paris 2024 organizers said their aim was to include “sports that can be shared on social media, sports that are a means of getting around, forms of expression, lifestyles in their own right, sports that are practiced every day, in the street and elsewhere.”",The organizers said their values led them to “sustainable and socially responsible” sports that do not require permanent facilities; sports that will engage young people and those in urban communities; and sports that are culturally relevant to France.,"Another initiative in that vein will be the opportunity for amateurs to run the Olympic marathon course after the official race has ended (which is, in essence, how most major marathons in the world operate, with a group of professional competitors preceding a larger, amateur field).","In their break dancing proposal, Paris 2024 organizers said there would be men’s and women’s events with a total of 32 athletes who would officially be referred to as B-boys and B-girls.","The competitions, meanwhile, would be referred to as “battles” and feature dancers taking turns performing dance moves and spins on the floor. Each routine would be graded, the organizers said, on criteria “such as technique, variety, performance, musicality, creativity and personality.”"
"Italian Alpine Spas, Where Sports Are an Afterthought - The New York Times","A paradise for skiers, the Italian Alps of South Tyrol offer a more placid pastime that’s surging anew. A host of spas are sprouting up in isolated tracts among the highlands, and though there’s hiking, biking and access to some of the Alps’ easier ski slopes, sports are a mere afterthought here. The spas draw skiers and nonskiers alike to spend days soaking in hot tubs, besotted by the view of these commanding, ice-shrouded peaks.","Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, when mineral springs became Europe’s cure-all for medical ills, wellness seekers flocked to the region’s famous waters and sanitariums. Today’s alpine spas are updating this long tradition as the present-day search for wellness has reinvigorated the desire for their timeless sedative effects.","For those of us who have forgotten what a multitude of stars looks like, the Italian Alps offer an immersion into lost wonders of contemporary life. Untrammeled snow. Unsullied air. A velvet cloak of silence. And the immeasurable reprieve of poor cellphone receptions.",It’s little surprise that these mountains have become the locus of a cluster of modern spa destinations designed to draw city dwellers to a place where tranquillity imposes itself by the very nature of the landscape.,"In December, I headed to the Alps to see how these age-old cures stood up to our high-intensity era of stress and self-care, visiting four contemporary spas set amid the summits of Italy’s South Tyrol region.","These spa hotels are dramatically modern, with bold architecture and cutting-edge restaurants. Their pools, saunas and hot tubs are designed for a forward-looking aesthetic and include outdoor heated pools that allow visitors to enjoy the mountain views alfresco, even when surrounded by snow. Though the look is up-to-date, the cures — hot soaks, massages, mountain air — are classic, and beckon a new generation in search of health and relaxation.","In their heyday, spas were metropolitan affairs, situated in cities like Merano. Health-seekers flocked to them for their restorative waters and for the society they provided at the theaters, casinos and dance halls that were common resort amenities.","In ancient times, the bathhouses that the Romans adapted from the Greek tradition were even more integral to cosmopolitan life. There were 952 bathhouses in Rome by 354 A.D.; they often included libraries, gyms, lecture halls, medical treatment facilities and gardens. The Baths of Diocletian alone accommodated up to 3,000 visitors at a time.","Today bathhouses are rare on our city maps, and serenity is a luxury reserved for infrequent vacations. Spas now must be deep in the woods, the dislocation and the staggering view of the mountains the only way to finally subdue us.","Modern Alpine spa resorts reimagine the mountains’ traditional wooden huts as lofty architectural temples of repose. On the sprawling plateau of the Alpe di Siusi in the Dolomites, set upon a grassland slope dotted with diminutive log cabins, the Adler Mountain Lodge mirrors the rustic little dwellings of its neighbors, but in palatial form. Built in the raw timber of local spruce trees, the double-gabled main hotel and a dozen surrounding chalets for rent are fronted by full glass walls, offering an awe-inspiring gaze at the serrated monoliths of the Sassopiatto and Sassolungo mountains, which rise like spiky arrowheads to lance the sky.","To pull back the morning curtains on this jagged expanse — the rocky massifs jangling in the bright sun or softened by fields of fresh falling snow — is to wake up to the grandeur of the greater world that, in our insular daily lives, we so easily forget.","Of course, the mountain views are just the beginning. There is a spa. A saltwater, womb-warm pool, constructed of the local silvery quartzite rock and filled by a nearby spring, extends from inside to out, where steam rises off the surface into the chilly air as visitors bob and recline, enveloped in Jacuzzi bubbles as they contemplate the horizon’s mammoth stony outcroppings. Two pinewood saunas, one filled with Tyrolean hay and its sharp, dry-earth perfume, offer panoramic views of the rough-chiseled topography. In the saunas — as in all the saunas of this area — genders are mingled and nude or lightly wrapped in towels. But as long as you’re comfortable glimpsing bare bodies, the personal sensation of simmering your own swimsuit-free body is, frankly, worth it.","Adler’s spa offers a post-excursion massage using Alpine arnica extract and mud to soothe overexerted legs, but no one seems to be in a great stink to get sporty here. There are options, though: The area offers a paradise for hikers, electric bikes are available in the summer and you can ski right out of the locker-room door onto mountain paths in the winter. The trails are wide and easy, and guests generally hit the slopes for a couple of hours at most. “Our slopes are good for cruising and enjoying the view,” says Nicol Lobis, a staff member at Adler Mountain Lodge. “But people come here to relax, not to burn their thighs to the max on black diamond slopes.” And besides, the bar is open all day.","For all its healthy overtones, Adler is an all-inclusive resort, serving up plentiful, thrice-daily meals and snacks in between. An all-hours bread and cheese buffet, like the well-stocked bar, is self-serve, giving the stay a decidedly more indulgent slant.","The restaurant’s dishes reflect South Tyrol’s unique history. A territory of Austria until World War I, the region’s primary language is still German; and smoked fish, caraway seeds, horseradish, beets and the very distinctive taste of milk thistle oil mark its cuisine as more Central European than Mediterranean, despite belonging to Italy for the last century. Yet the Adler dedicates Italian-style special attention to superbly high-quality local ingredients.","The hotel opened in 2014 and was the first resort of its kind in this Arcadian area of the Alpe di Siusi, which, as part of the Unesco-protected Dolomites, allows only a handful of cars and even fewer building developments.","In Italy’s Alps, the modern movement of forest spas launched with the opening of the Vigilius Resort in 2003. Designed by the renowned architect Matteo Thun, the hotel is a starkly contemporary expanse of glass and lumber 5,000 feet up the mountainside, reachable only by cable car. In its first years, the Vigilius won awards for its sustainable energy approach and introduced the idea of the eco resort to the area, setting the bar for subsequent spas’ natural material use and extreme energy efficiency. The Vigilius’s glass-fronted sauna and indoor-outdoor heated pool immerse visitors in a dramatically dense view of larch trees and craggy peaks, but the resort is in need of a refresh to keep up with the high style introduced by more recent eco resorts in the vicinity.","Atop the isolated Avelengo plateau visible on a mountaintop opposite the Vigilius, the San Luis Retreat Hotel & Lodges is a collection of modern chalets and “tree houses” on stilts, all splayed on a meadow around a central lake, with hills of larch trees rising behind. There are no rooms at this hotel; instead, there are individual cabins of one or two floors, with rosy exteriors of aged, untreated wood that face the water and the nighttime fire pits along its piers. Their hardwood interiors pair polished modern interpretations of farmhouse furniture with a crackling fireplace, a private hot tub on the deck and a sauna with a panoramic glass wall, so guests can enjoy spa time in solitude — perhaps the most romantic setup of the resorts in South Tyrol.","“Everyone lives in cities, but they all dream of a house in the woods,” said Ilse Meister, who, along with her husband and two grown children, launched the San Luis spa resort in 2015, a countryside complement to the urban Hotel Irma that the family has run in Merano for generations. “We were convinced that in the future, the thing that would be most important for our guests would be total silence.”","As evening falls amid the dimly lit cabins, the only sounds are the occasional bather languidly splashing in the burbling Jacuzzi, and the soft popcorn snaps of newly lit fires, as the last sun rays fade behind the delicate, silhouetted web of pine branches surrounding the ridge. Chimney smoke and the balsamic pitch of evergreen needles scent the clean breeze. At the center of the grounds, a soaring wood-beam lodge — the candle-filled main hall — contains the dining room of the full-board (excluding alcohol) hotel and its main sauna and steam room. A fireplace marks the heart of the glassed-in, gabled-roof barn that holds the heated pool, which opens to an outdoor pool and a Jacuzzi perched on a pier in the middle of the lake, its warm vapors swirling and rising into brisk evening air.","There are no cold-plunge pools here, or seemingly anywhere in South Tyrol — surprising, as the ancient Romans themselves were great practitioners of hot/cold immersion therapy, a practice continued today in many bathing cultures. A frigid shower after the sweat of the sauna will never induce the dazzling, purifying tingle of a full icy dunk: a stupefying feeling that your entire body is mentholated, a trick that keeps you warm through wintry days.","But at the San Luis, you can improvise with a bracing roll in the snow (tried and recommended) or a leap in the lake, depending on the season; and the chalets’ big, free-standing baths can be adapted for cold immersion after partaking of the personal sauna and hot tub (also recommended).","A short car ride away, the Hotel Miramonti is “a mountain hotel in the city,” says Klaus Alber, who opened it in 2016 with his wife, Carmen. It’s distinctly more urban than the other Alpine spa resorts, but its position — secluded on a promontory 4,000 feet above Merano, along a steep country road winding past apple orchards, flocks of grazing mountain goats, a lovely 14th-century Romanesque church and antique castles — is still detached from the hustle and bustle seen vertiginously below.","The red fir lumber exterior of the boutique hotel’s triple-peaked lodge mirrors the mountains across the Merano valley, a majestic palisade of zigzagging, snow-crowned geometry at the sky’s edge that’s visible from each of the hotel’s weathered wood balconies. The rooms — of which the lofts are the coziest — are fitted with raw planks of oak and fir as at the other resorts, but contrasted here with stark white walls and minimalist Scandinavian furniture from Copenhagen’s &Tradition brand; more urban design hotel than chic chalet.","Merano, its illuminated tangle of city streets visible straight down the hotel’s front cliff, is just a 15-minute drive away, and guests often descend for dinner or a day trip. Yet the Miramonti, built on porphyry rock amid a thicket of trees, still has miles of woodland paths just out its back door, and the Merano 2000 ski slopes are a short shuttle ride away.","Set a few steps outside the hotel’s lodge, an elevated pinewood and glass cabin — Miramonti’s forest sauna — allows guests to enjoy Finnish heat while surveying the surrounding copse of firs and the mountain crests in the distance. A hot tub is tucked into nearby bushes. Smart, ash-gray linen recliners line the indoor and outdoor observation deck with a view over the valley. But this slickly modern spa shines brightest with its design-forward, photo-ready outdoor infinity pool, partially covered by a pitched cottage roof and jutting out to seemingly hover above the precipice. Floating at the water’s edge, with the city beneath silenced by its remoteness, the pool’s projection offers a vantage point of quiet calm; the hushed, hulking mountains seem to be all yours.","What does it take to relax these days? As the stresses of work, life and the modern world pile up, perhaps we ought, like Romans, to let our heads float in womb-like bubbles more often.","At the San Luis, I tried a massage, although days of spas had — I thought — already rendered my body the tender consistency of a jellyfish. Yet the masseuse paused as her fingertips alighted on my spine. “Do you spend a lot of time working at a desk?” Well, yes.","She kneaded a constellation of unexpected knots around my shoulder blades, clucking that everyone she saw these days had the same condition. “You need a massage once a week, or you’ll damage your back.” Need, she told me. Need. Did the Romans, with their weekly spa-time and scheduled self-care, have knots in their backs? Perhaps the masseuse is right. Need indeed.","Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Tiger Woods’s Masters Win Joins the Ranks of Great Sports Comebacks - The New York Times,"Tiger Woods hadn’t won a major in 11 years. He had struggled through injury and personal crises. He was dismissed as finished, his years of dominance fading into memory.","Then on Sunday he won the Masters again, at age 43.","When athletes begin to fade, it’s usually all over. But a select few have returned in triumph, defying setbacks or Father Time.",The comeback most people thought of when Woods won Sunday was the Masters victory by Jack Nicklaus at age 46 in 1986. Nicklaus had not won a major in six years and became the oldest player to win the Masters.,"Even more incredible was the return of Ben Hogan at the 1950 U.S. Open. His car had collided head-on with a Greyhound bus in Texas in 1949, and Hogan was nearly killed. After two months in the hospital, and a year recovering, he returned to golf and won the Open. He added five more major championships over the next three years.","After three straight championships with the Chicago Bulls from 1991 to ’93, Michael Jordan decided to give baseball a try. A .200 batting average in the minor leagues made him a figure of ridicule for many fans and commentators, and the N.B.A. moved on.","Then as abruptly as he retired, Jordan came back in 1995. In his first three full seasons, the Bulls won three more titles. Jordan retired again in 1999, generally considered the best player in basketball history. (A second comeback, with the Washington Wizards, was less successful.)","After Muhammad Ali declined to serve in the military during the Vietnam War, he was stripped of his heavyweight title and was unable to box for three years.","When he was able to get relicensed in 1970, he resumed a career that is regularly cited as the greatest. He regained his title in 1974 and battled through three immortal fights against Joe Frazier.","George Foreman, from whom Ali recaptured the heavyweight title in 1974, hung up the gloves in 1977. But 10 years later, at 38, he decided to return to the ring. After a series of wins, he got a shot at the title at age 42, but lost to Evander Holyfield. He kept boxing, though, and got another improbable title shot in 1994 at 45 years old. Incredibly, he beat the champion, Michael Moorer, and won three more fights before losing in his final bout in 1997 at age 48.","Roger Federer’s win at the Australian Open in 2017, at age 35, was his first major title in five years and capped a comeback from back injuries and knee surgery. Beating Rafael Nadal in that final showed Federer could defeat the younger rivals who had flummoxed him during his drought. In 2018, he won the Australian Open again, for his 20th major title, and returned to No. 1.",Jennifer Capriati was written off after her career as a teen star was derailed by personal problems. She quit the tour for two years and dropped out of the rankings. But she returned in 1996 a more mature player and won the Australian Open in 2001 at 24. She became world No. 1 and added two more Grand Slam titles.,"But the most inspiring tennis comeback undoubtedly belonged to Monica Seles, who was stabbed by a deranged fan on the court in 1993. She was 19, No. 1 and an eight-time major singles champion at the time. Seles struggled with her injuries and with understandable anxiety after the attack. Still, she returned to win the 1996 Australian Open and make three other Grand Slam finals.","Quarterback Doug Williams helped lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the 1979 N.F.C. championship game. But after a salary dispute in 1982, he left to join the fledgling U.S.F.L.","When that league folded, Williams caught on as a backup to Jay Schroeder for the Washington Redskins in 1987. But Williams earned the starting job just before the playoffs and led the team to a Super Bowl title, the first black quarterback ever to do so.","Aldiniti was a solid steeplechaser in Britain in the late 1970s before sustaining a bad leg injury. At about the same time, the jockey Bob Champion learned he had testicular cancer. Once both had recovered, they were paired for the 1981 Grand National and won it. Their triumph was turned into a 1984 movie, “Champions,” starring John Hurt.","Honorable mention goes to Da Hoss. He won the 1996 Breeders’ Cup Mile, then raced only once in two years. Yet in his return to the Mile in 1998, he won it again, causing the race announcer Tom Durkin to proclaim it “the greatest comeback since Lazarus.”","Greg LeMond became the first American to win the Tour de France in 1986 and seemed poised to reel off several more. But the next year he was accidentally shot while turkey hunting, hit by several dozen pellets, including some in his heart lining.","He returned to the Tour in 1989 in poor form and was considering retirement. But he strengthened as the race went along and won it in one of the most famous finishes ever, beating his rival Laurent Fignon in a time trial on the Champs-Élysées. The final margin was the closest in history: eight seconds. LeMond went on to win another Tour the next year.","Tommy John had a strong 12-year career as a pitcher for the Indians, White Sox and Dodgers. But in 1974 he sustained an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow, which usually meant the end of pitchers’ careers.","John decided to try an untested, speculative surgery, now known as Tommy John surgery. In the procedure, now routine, a tendon from elsewhere in the patient is removed and replaces the damaged one in the elbow.","John missed the 1975 season, but returned the next season at 33. He had three more All-Star appearances and three 20-game win seasons before finally retiring in 1989 at 46."

They can involve livestock, soup commercials, magazine covers and, frequently, the selling of star players.","In recent years, the rapper Lil B has made a name for himself in the sports realm with his curses — most notably on James Harden of the Houston Rockets — but it appears he has some new competition: the rapper Ja Rule.","It all started on Saturday, when Ja Rule was performing at halftime of a game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the host Milwaukee Bucks.","The performance came on the 17th anniversary of Ja Rule’s collaboration with Ashanti, “Always Be On Time,” hitting No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. But the show came under criticism immediately because of a somewhat misleading video of the crowd reaction and another one showing an unexpected guest: Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks’ star forward, who came out to begin warming up for the second half while Ja Rule was still performing on the court along with a group of dancers.","The rapper initially shrugged off the criticism, but his tone changed when the Timberwolves decided to mock the performance on social media. In a post to Twitter, the team said “We too were hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!” The post was a reference to an earlier post by Ja Rule about his role in the ill-fated Fyre Festival, a luxury music event in the Bahamas that failed spectacularly in 2017. ",The rapper was not amused.,"The potential effects of this particular curse are unclear, though. The Timberwolves have existed as a franchise for 30 seasons and not only have not won a championship, but they have only made it out of the first round of the playoffs once — in 2004. They are 28-31, putting them just outside legitimate playoff contention, and the notion that Karl-Anthony Towns is departing anytime soon — as Ja Rule suggested with “AND KAT IS LEAVING!!!” — seems unlikely, as he has signed a five-year contract extension that kicks in next year and guarantees him nearly $160 million.","Of course, logic does not have to play a role in sports curses. The Chicago Cubs endured the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat for more than 70 years after the team asked the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, William Sianis, to leave a game because his goat was bothering fans. That the team had not won a World Series in more than 30 years before the episode was treated as mostly irrelevant. ",Other popular curses have included one in which the athletes endorsing Campbell’s Chunky Soup seemed to become injured at an extraordinary rate. Another claimed that athletes had their performance fall off after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated.,"The most famous, of course, is the Curse of the Bambino, which doomed the Boston Red Sox to lose after selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in December 1919. The jinx is credited by some with keeping the Red Sox from winning a World Series for 86 years, despite the first year of that stretch coming before the team sold Ruth, and the fact that the curse was barely mentioned in popular culture before George Vecsey wrote a column about it for The New York Times in 1986. Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe also wrote a book in 1990 that popularized the phrase.","At the very least, the talk of Ja Rule’s curse was good news for Lil B, who spent part of the weekend trending on Twitter. He celebrated by retweeting various people saying Ja Rule was simply stealing a tactic that Lil B had already perfected."
"For Women Working in Men’s Sports, It Is Not an Honor Just to Be Nominated - The New York Times",The hiring of the W.N.B.A. point guard Kristi Toliver as a full-time assistant coach with the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards while she is still an active player was widely applauded as a notable new achievement for women in coaching.,"It followed the San Antonio Spurs’ hiring of Becky Hammon, and other women like Nancy Lieberman and Jenny Boucek also joining N.B.A. coaching staffs.","“With anything, you need to see it to be it,” said Briann January, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury and, in her off-season, an assistant women’s basketball coach at Arizona State. “I see it now because of Becky. Because of Kristi. I see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional area.”","For many players, the moves showed N.B.A. teams tapping into a longstanding, significant pipeline of female talent.","“I think a lot of women in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunities in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team, to any organization, no matter our gender,” said Alana Beard, a veteran Los Angeles Sparks guard often mentioned as a coaching candidate by her peers.","Beard cited the meager pay Toliver is to receive this season — just $10,000 because of limits in the W.N.B.A.’s collective bargaining agreement — as an “extremely important” issue for the league to address in negotiations for a new agreement. The goal would be making a barrier that has long been permeable on one side — men into women’s basketball on the coaching side — into a free exchange of talent, regardless of gender, based on opportunity.","Many, if not most, W.N.B.A. players, who are paid significantly less than their male counterparts, cannot afford to spend their off-season working for so little pay. Their basketball skills are worth much more — into the millions of dollars — in service of women’s leagues overseas.","“All of those things on a coach’s plate to take care of, to do that for $10,000 for an entire N.B.A. season is crazy,” January said. “I’d like to break that down and do the math, like how much that is a game or how much that is a day. That would just be insult to injury.”","Yet some people, including commentators on internet sites and men’s basketball fans in real life, contend these women should be happy to have opportunities at all.","This attitude rankles many W.N.B.A. players — that even Toliver’s shot, let alone chances for other women with considerable experience playing and in many cases coaching, is often thought of as a one-sided benefit for those who are hired.","But in many cases, the N.B.A. came calling after seeing the women excelling on their own. Toliver’s work with the Mystics helped bring her to the attention of Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, just as Hammon got her opportunity in San Antonio because she was employed by the Silver Stars, then owned by the same group as the Spurs, and her W.N.B.A. coach, Dan Hughes, talked her up to Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.","“I had a chance to put two parties together that I knew would work,” Hughes, now the head coach of the Seattle Storm, said. “I knew Becky, and I also knew Pop, and I knew that Pop, we had a lot of years of conversation about Becky. He had seen her play when I first brought her to San Antonio. So to me it was an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each other.”","Toliver has opened up that discussion in significant ways, which she said was a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place. In Hughes’s eyes, it is nothing less than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia has prevented the men’s basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the women’s side of the sport, the next step toward N.B.A. teams and W.N.B.A. teams and men’s and women’s college basketball programs all hiring from the same pool of candidates.","As Hughes sees it, it’s time, not because these women deserve a chance, but because every basketball team needs more coaches like Hammon, Toliver and those who will follow.","“I want a world someday where people judge coaches on how good a coach they truly are,” Hughes said. “Doesn’t matter if they’re male or female, doesn’t matter their background. They can say he’s a coach or she’s a coach, and we can use them.”","Every W.N.B.A. player who stays home instead of playing overseas in her off-season, the athletes said, is potentially one more person around which to promote the league year-round, and that player gets to rest, too. The grind of playing 12 months a year has led to W.N.B.A. players like Diana Taurasi and Angel McCoughtry taking seasons off.","“You always want to protect your product,” January said. “And the majority of our product is being run down and beaten up year-round playing this game. So when they come back around to play in the W.N.B.A., you have half of your players injured, playing through nagging things. We still find a way to have a high talent and high level of basketball, which is crazy to me.","“We just have some really strong women, but that needs to be a discussion. What can we do to provide other opportunities for women to make income and prepare for the future on a real-life scale? Something they can live on. Something that makes sense.”"
"Bribes and Big-Time Sports: U.S.C. Finds Itself, Once Again, Facing Scandal - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES — On the palm-tree-lined campus of the University of Southern California this week, a tour guide proudly pointed out to prospective students the university’s six Heisman football trophies and award-winning faculty, testaments to the stellar reputation the school has fought hard to build.","Yet only a day earlier, U.S.C. had emerged at the epicenter of an unfolding college admissions scandal involving federal charges of bribery, cheating and parents who were willing to pay thousands of dollars to get their underperforming children into some of the nation’s top universities.","Of the nearly three dozen parents named in court documents unveiled this week, more than half are accused of bribing their way into the elite private campus in the heart of Los Angeles. Four U.S.C. athletics officials are charged with taking bribes, more than the number named at any other school. Donna Heinel, one of the university’s top athletics administrators, helped get more than two dozen students admitted as athletes, federal prosecutors charged, though none of them were qualified to play competitive sports.",[Read more on the Justice Department’s largest ever college admissions prosecution.],"Reeling from what was only the latest scandal to unfold over the past two years, campus officials insisted this week that U.S.C. was a victim in the bribery and cheating case and vowed to reject any applicants involved in fraudulent admissions.","Six students who applied for admission this fall were involved in the alleged bribery scheme, officials said, and would be rejected. The university was still investigating how many current students were also implicated.","“This will not set us back in any way,” Wanda Austin, the interim president, said in an interview. “We have parents who set a horrible example, and employees who clearly acted in a way that showed they need to be fired.”","The campus today is far different from the one students encountered decades ago when the school was better known as a home for the children of Los Angeles’s wealthy elite, snidely referred to as the “University of Spoiled Children.” In the 1990s, the university began an extensive overhaul, building on its reputation as an athletic powerhouse and ranking academically among the nation’s top-tier schools.","It recruited star faculty, including six Nobel laureates, and raised standards for admission, admitting last year only 13 percent of those who applied. The campus also made a major investment in its athletic programs, winning national football championships, while also drawing top athletes to play tennis, water polo, volleyball and track.","But a series of corruption scandals has torn through the university, threatening those years of image building.","In 2017, the medical school dean was fired over accusations of drug use and prostitution, and his successor resigned after allegations of sexual harassment. After yet another scandal emerged in 2018, involving a campus gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct, the university’s president, C.L. Max Nikias, was forced to step down. Then at the end of last year, the dean of the business school was ousted over the mishandling of workplace misconduct claims.","How the university built itself up only to be undermined by such profound internal turmoil has left students, parents, faculty and the vast Trojan alumni network wondering whether the university can manage to maintain its stature. It has also prompted many to begin asking: Has the push to raise money to boost the school’s programs gone too far? Is everything at U.S.C. for sale?","Josh Meltzer, who graduated in 2002, said he has been alarmed by the “apparently constant lack of ethical and responsible leadership” in the last several years.","“U.S.C. prides itself on creating this massive Trojan family and alumni are constantly asked to support the university with donations, but it’s hard to imagine doing that right now,” Mr. Meltzer said. “When I was a freshman I looked around at our class and was proud it certainly wasn’t all rich kids — we were coming from a lot of diverse backgrounds and had done really well in high school.”","Ms. Austin has vowed to have more accountability and transparency and said that the school would reject any current applicants who are connected to the bribery scheme. She and others at the campus have expressed shock at the brazen willingness of parents, as described in the charging documents, to subvert the admissions system.","In one conversation referred to in the indictment and captured by a wiretap, a Beverly Hills marketing executive, Jane Buckingham, discussed how to get her son into U.S.C. with William Singer, the admissions counselor who has pleaded guilty to organizing the bribery and cheating scheme. She admitted that it was a reach.","“I need you to get him into U.S.C., and then I need you to cure cancer and [make peace] in the Middle East,” Ms. Buckingham said.","“I can do that,” Mr. Singer replied.",[Read the full list of who has been charged here.],"Yet even the chairman of the university’s board of trustees, Rick J. Caruso, a Los Angeles real estate developer, emerged with a personal connection: As prosecutors announced that the Hollywood star Lori Loughlin was being charged with bribing her daughter’s way into U.S.C., the daughter was on Mr. Caruso’s yacht, sharing a spring break vacation in the Bahamas with Mr. Caruso’s daughter.","“My daughter and a group of students left for spring break prior to the government’s announcement yesterday,” Mr. Caruso said in a statement. “Once we became aware of the investigation, the young woman decided it would be in her best interest to return home.”","The bribery allegations, he said, were “just unthinkable.”","Mark Piccirillo, who was visiting the campus from Dallas this week with his daughter, a high school junior, said he was disappointed but not surprised to learn about the bribes. He said the case affirmed his long-held belief that the system was rigged in favor of the rich and privileged.","“The one thing that bothers me about the whole thing is it’s hard enough to get in regularly,” he said. “My guess is this is the tip of the iceberg.”","The center of the scandal swirled around the school’s athletics department, which over the years has been the most visible way the school presents itself to the world. As the bribery case made clear, the system to recruit student athletes — who are already sometimes held to lesser academic standards than other students — can be subject to manipulation.","“The fact that there is this entirely separate system for athletes’ admission and recruitment that frankly lends itself to corruption and abuse is really disturbing,” said Ariela Gross, a law professor at the university. “There’s the broader class issue of wealthy people buying access or stacking the deck in normal, legal ways.”","At one time, there was no better symbol of the renaissance at U.S.C. than the football team.","The Trojans, behind a charismatic coach, Pete Carroll, eagerly filled the professional football void left in Los Angeles by the departure of the Rams and the Raiders.","Mr. Carroll, who was hired in 2000, built a juggernaut, winning 45 of 46 games at one point with teams that were as entertaining as they were dominating, routinely packing the cavernous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.","As the building boom in and around campus took root, investment continued in athletics, which, thanks to football’s rejuvenation, had seen revenues double to $76 million over an eight-year period. A long-awaited basketball arena, a state-of-the-art tennis stadium and a glistening new administration building were built, fortifying programs like water polo, tennis and track and field, which continued to chase national championships and produce a steady stream of Olympians.",But football was hit by its own recruitment scandal nearly a decade ago.,"The team’s stars back then were treated as such, receiving the Hollywood treatment.","Snoop Dogg hovered near the end zone during games and ran pass patterns at practice. Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx and Spike Lee stood along the sidelines, regularly flanked by professional athletes.","But it came crumbling down in 2010 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association, after a clumsy, contentious and lengthy investigation into whether football and basketball players had received illegal gifts from agents, hit the school with crippling penalties.","The university moved swiftly to recover. Mr. Nikias succeeded Steven B. Sample as president that same year and began building the school into a fund-raising powerhouse. For the last several years, it has been one of the top universities in annual fund-raising, along with Harvard and Stanford, raising $6 billion in a recent campaign.","Mr. Nikias used the N.C.A.A. sanctions as the impetus to clean house — firing the athletic director, Mike Garrett, himself a former Heisman Trophy winner. Mr. Nikias also beefed up the rules compliance office, hiring a prominent Los Angeles lawyer, and soon had a nine-person staff.","“We’re going to have a culture of compliance,” Pat Haden, the replacement U.S.C. athletic director, told The New York Times at the time. “We’re going to think about it in the morning, think about it before we go to bed. We’re going to have issues but we’ll fess up and be better than the way before.”","As part of the restructuring, one administrator was soon thrust into a more prominent role — Ms. Heinel, a former college swimmer.","Ms. Heinel now stands accused of collecting more than $1.3 million in payments directed from parents through Mr. Singer between 2014 and 2018, and drawing $20,000 per month from Mr. Singer since last July through a sham consultant agreement.","Ms. Heinel, who came to U.S.C. in 2003, was fired Tuesday along with Jovan Vavic, the hugely successful water polo coach who was charged in the current affidavit with accepting $250,000 from Mr. Singer. Two former U.S.C. soccer coaches — Ali Khosroshahin and his assistant, Laura Janke — have been charged with taking $350,000 from Mr. Singer. So, too, has Bill Ferguson, the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, who led the men’s team at U.S.C. for a decade before leaving in 2016. He is accused of accepting $100,000 from Mr. Singer.","The recent scandals haven’t appeared to dim the university’s powerful lure for prospective students. This year, U.S.C. received close to 66,000 applicants, its largest pool ever, with the highest collective grade point averages and SAT scores ever recorded.","Yet in the aftermath of the latest news, many faculty and students said they felt betrayed and angered.","“I’m infuriated by what happened and what she did,” said Tom Walsh, a former U.S.C. track and cross-country coach, who left in 2013 after 19 years at the school, referring to Ms. Heinel. “I felt like our program, we got denied a few people that we thought were going to get into our program, legit track and field international stars. Now, you look back and wonder why they didn’t get in. Did they make space for these phony people?”","Summer Dahlquist-Tookey, 18, a freshman, said that for her, the indictments had only underscored the role money played in the admissions process. “From the moment I stepped onto U.S.C.’s campus, I noticed how wealthy most of the students were,” she said. “I have classmates who have the same last names as buildings on campus. Once we hear that, we basically know how they got in.”"
College Scholarships for Middle Schoolers? N.C.A.A. Plans Vote to Limit Early Recruiting - The New York Times,The recent roiling college admissions fraud scandal exposed how the athletic recruiting system at desirable institutions can be manipulated to grant privileged treatment even to students with fabricated athletic achievements.,"But for truly gifted young athletes drawn into the cryptic world of college sports recruiting, the pressure to lock up a spot at a top university can arrive as early as the seventh grade. In what has become a common, disquieting tactic in dozens of sports — from soccer to volleyball — skilled, athletic middle-schoolers are pressured by coaches offering full athletic scholarships to commit to attend institutions many years before they will fill out an admissions application.","Sometimes, the offer comes with a take-it-or-leave-it deadline. And because of the pervasive obsession with getting into high-ranking colleges — and better yet, with landing a scholarship that will help cover the cost — anxious athletes and their families eagerly, if sometimes rashly, accept.","“Parents are worried and panicked that those offers are going to disappear,” said Justin Sell, the athletic director at South Dakota State University and a prominent member of N.C.A.A. legislative committees. “There shouldn’t be a rush. No seventh-grader should be faced with that decision.”","Now, a coalition of administrators, coaches, faculty and students have banded together to fight back against such early recruiting, and this month the N.C.A.A. is poised to prohibit early recruiting in most college sports. High-profile sports like football and basketball would be excluded.","A proposal before the 40-member N.C.A.A. Division I Council, if approved by a majority during meetings April 18 and 19, would ban all recruiting contact between coaches and athletes until June 15 of the prospective student’s sophomore year in high school. Official visits to campuses by recruits could not occur before Aug. 1 after their sophomore year. Third parties, including a recruit’s family members and high school or club coaches, would also be prohibited from recruiting-related communications before June 15.","Football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey would be excluded from the new guidelines because of the professional contract opportunities recruits in those sports are sometimes considering in addition to attending college, council members said. College coaches asked for the ability to communicate with the athletes as those options are being weighed.","Karen Weekly, a co-head softball coach at the University of Tennessee, said her brethren had reached the breaking point on early recruiting in recent years when sixth graders had suddenly begun committing to programs in her league, the Southeastern Conference.","“There was no boundary to stop it,” Weekly said. “Ten years ago, we thought sophomores committing was too young. Sixth graders? Enough is enough.”","Kerstin Kimel, the women’s lacrosse coach at Duke University, explained that in the last decade some coaches had tried to gain a competitive advantage by hoarding ever younger, promising athletes before rival coaches could discover them. Kimel said the ploy had become more widespread in part because of the mania among parents eager to gain entry to leading institutions.","“Savvy parents are saying, ‘If we’re early to all this recruiting, maybe that’s our shot to get into certain places,’” Kimel said.","While there is broad support for establishing early-recruiting embargoes, there is, however, disagreement over substantial details within the new recruiting regulations. Two sports, lacrosse and softball, are lobbying to be excluded from the proposed N.C.A.A. legislation because they have already established their own more stringent early-recruiting rules. Two years ago, the national lacrosse coaches associations received the N.C.A.A.’s approval to prohibit recruiting contact until Sept. 1 of a student’s junior year of high school, or 11 weeks — one summer — later than the date in the N.C.A.A. proposal. With some amendments, softball adopted the lacrosse guidelines last year.","“The Sept. 1 date has kept that summer before the athletes’ junior year calmer and free from recruiting and has led to a more thorough evaluation, including academically, on both sides,” said Mike Murphy, the men’s lacrosse coach at the University of Pennsylvania.",Kimel noted that starting the recruiting contact on June 15 could distract a high school student during final exams and interrupt the conclusion of recruits’ spring sports seasons.,"Samantha J. Ekstrand, who acts as legal counsel to the lacrosse and softball coaches associations, said that in a recent poll of softball coaches, 82.5 percent were opposed to rolling back the recruiting start date to June 15.","“A lot of thought went into the Sept. 1 date,” Ekstrand said. “It might not seem a big shift, but it’s a colossal shift.”","The leaders of the national body that represents college athletes insisted that their constituency overwhelmingly endorses a uniform date for the start of recruiting in as many sports as possible, mostly to avoid confusion.","Nicholas Clark, a former football player who is one of two college athletes elected by their peers to serve on the Division I Council, said representatives from every campus in 32 conferences were polled.","“They want us to vote for the proposal,” Clark said.","Blake James, the council chairman and the athletic director at the University of Miami, said he has heard from parents of high school athletes who told him they were eager to contact coaches earlier and preferred the June 15 date.","“Ultimately, I don’t know exactly where we’ll end up on this,” James said. “But it will be a much better place for both youth sports and college sports.”"
Judge Opens the Door to More Compensation for College Athletes - The New York Times,"A federal judge on Friday, in a closely watched case, opened the way for college football and basketball players to receive more compensation than they do now, but narrowly limited the benefits to expenses “related to education.”","The ruling was somewhat of a victory for the athletes but fell well short of their goal of eliminating the N.C.A.A.’s cap on their compensation, which the organization has argued is vital to maintaining a semblance of amateurism in college sports.","In the ruling in Federal District Court in Oakland, Calif., Judge Claudia Wilken determined that amateurism rules barring payment beyond scholarships and certain related costs of education violate antitrust law.","Schools, she said, can compensate athletes for education-related expenses such as postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad, and computers and musical instruments. Individual conferences could cap these payments.","But in a ruling of more than 100 pages, Judge Wilken also supported the N.C.A.A.’s claim that students should not become professionals while playing for school teams.","“The court does credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sports and professional sports,” she said in Friday’s ruling. “In addition to the fact that college sports are played by students actually attending the college, student-athletes are not paid the very large salaries that characterize the professional sports leagues that many student-athletes aspire to.”","Still, rather than settle the matter, the decision seemed likely to continue the debate. She stayed the ruling pending appeals.","Jeffrey Kessler, a prominent sports lawyer who represented the college athletes, a group of football and basketball players, called the ruling a win, while acknowledging that it stopped short of his clients’ full goals.","“It’s just going be a big step forward, and not the full bringing down of the edifice,” he said.","The ruling, he added, “will create a whole litany of benefits for the athletes.”","“And as I say, that’s terrific,” he continued. “We had hoped we could get an even greater opening of the market. But as I said, one step at a time.”","In a statement, the N.C.A.A.’s counsel, Donald Remy, said the association would “explore our next steps.” In tightly limiting her ruling, he said, the judge clearly acknowledged that “college sports should be played by student-athletes, not by paid professionals.”","“The decision,” he added, “acknowledges that the popularity of college sports stems in part from the fact that these athletes are indeed students, who must not be paid unlimited cash sums unrelated to education.” He also noted that “the court rejected the plaintiffs’ desire for a free-market system.”","Several years ago, a federal appeals court, in overturning Judge Wilken in a previous case, allowed college athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses in video games and other media, but limited the amounts.","In a sign of her wrestling with the issue, Judge Wilken signaled she might endorse another way, in which the N.C.A.A. might allow colleges to reward athletes’ academic progress financially, up to the value currently permitted for performance-related bonuses. (For instance, the N.C.A.A. allows championship rings worth no more than a few hundred dollars each.) This, Mr. Kessler suggested, could be a way to annually get thousands of dollars more to athletes.","The players had asked Judge Wilken to bar the N.C.A.A. from restricting pay to athletes outright, letting individual conferences set any limits. Failing that, they wanted her to uncap certain bonuses that athletes are allowed to be paid.",Judge Wilken rebuffed these requests.,"She did so while brushing aside many of the college sports establishment’s cherished arguments in favor of amateurism. The notion that paying college athletes more decreases demand for college sports, she said, was belied by the plaintiffs’ expert testimony as well as the fact that college athletes have been paid thousands of dollars more in the past few years — partly thanks to her ruling in the previous case — without affecting ratings and interest.",She also acknowledged the stark economic reality that advocates for players frequently cite: that “the extraordinary revenues that defendants derive from these sports” demonstrate that capping players’ compensation at scholarships and related costs “is not commensurate with the value that they create.”

Russia Warms to Controversial TUEs After Doping Scandals - The New York Times,"MOSCOW — After years of using hacked data to vilify Western athletes as cheats who bend the rules to take banned substances, Russia is warming to a controversial part of the anti-doping system.",Russian President Vladimir Putin said in 2017 that the country's rivals were using Therapeutic Use Exemptions to game the system. The exemptions allow athletes to treat medical conditions with substances that would otherwise be banned.,"If they were really ill, Putin said, ""maybe they should enter the Paralympics.""","Late last month, though, Putin gave a high-profile speaking slot at a meeting of his Fitness and Sports Council to a veteran gymnastics official who urged Russians to apply for more TUEs.","""We must use this opportunity on a legal basis,"" Irina Viner-Usmanova told the televised meeting, calling on the sports ministry and the government's Federal Medical-Biological Agency to help.","Russia's years of doping scandals, she said, had taught Russia to use legitimate avenues properly.","""This experience let us be more attentive and law-abiding when taking medical products,"" Viner-Usmanova said.","Statistics show TUEs are in demand as Russia returns to sports following bans, like from last year's Winter Olympics.","The Russian anti-doping agency, known as RUSADA, received a record 101 TUE applications last year, and is on track to breeze past that number this year. After years when doping was widespread in Russian sport, the agency hails the rise as the result of better education and legitimate sports medicine.","Despite the rise in applications, RUSADA says athletes and team doctors struggle to understand the system. Only 22 applications were approved last year.","Officials from RUSADA and the UK Anti-Doping Agency, which handled Russian TUEs until September, turned down applications which lacked medical documents, or from athletes asking for medicines that weren't actually banned.","RUSADA deputy CEO Margarita Pakhnotskaya argued that even the more clueless applications at least indicate growing respect for the rules. She said ""one or two"" filings seemed like an attempt to cheat and were passed on to RUSADA's investigations unit.","While some Russian athletes may be getting TUEs direct from international sports federations, RUSADA's numbers remain relatively low by European standards. Not all agencies publish TUE data, though Norway granted 85 applications and refused nine last year, while German figures for 2017 show 72 approvals and seven rejections.","In the high-stakes world of Olympic sports, athletes can risk a ban for failing to declare some relatively common medications. Without the TUE system, athletes who get injured or have longer-term conditions like asthma might have to spend long periods on the sidelines until medicines left their system completely, or risk their health by going without treatment.",Russia's ire at Western athletes followed regular hacks by the Fancy Bears group — which U.S. law enforcement said last year was a cover for Russian military intelligence.,"The Fancy Bears' website, which once promised ""sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances,"" now bears a message that it has been seized by the FBI. The Russian government denies involvement in hacking.","The Fancy Bears published dozens of athletes' medical histories, though no Russian TUEs. Stripped of their context — injuries or illness — many applications were legitimate but looked suspicious.","One case in particular rocked the world of cycling. The leaked documents revealed that Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins sought TUEs for injections of triamcinolone acetate before key races in 2011, 2012 and 2013. He denied wrongdoing and was not banned, but a series of high-profile investigations damaged his reputation and that of Team Sky.",The TUE process still carries a stigma in Russia.,"Russian biathlete Margarita Vasilyeva told state TV last month that despite having asthma, she refused to get permission to use an inhaler.","""It's not really honest, I think,"" said Vasilyeva, who faces separate doping-related difficulties after being accused of failing to make herself available for testing on three occasions.","Pakhnotskaya, whose job includes running educational seminars on anti-doping across Russia, doesn't want athletes to dismiss TUEs out of hand. After all, who knows when they might get ill?","""I don't think all Russian athletes or all Russian officials should wake up and think how great TUE requests are,"" she said. ""But each one who has the right to get it should know the procedure.""",___

"The N.C.A.A. Lost in Court, but Athletes Didn’t Win, Either - The New York Times","If the opinion published Friday night in a landmark college sports antitrust case were a novel, then its villain would be the N.C.A.A.","In a novella-length 104-page opinion, United States District Court Judge Claudia Wilken criticizes, berates, even mocks the N.C.A.A. for its refusal to allow colleges to compensate players for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related costs of attendance, all in the name of something they call amateurism.","“Defendants nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumers insist upon,” said Wilken, referring to the N.C.A.A. and several of its richest, most prominent conferences.","Even if they had, Wilken continued, she pointed to numerous exceptions when players could, effectively, be paid. Players are paid, beyond scholarships, all the time: in untold millions of dollars invested in training facilities; in gifts for participating in bowl games; in funds available to purchase loss-of-value insurance.","“The rules that permit, limit or forbid student-athlete compensation and benefits do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism,” she said.",The decision stems from a long-running case in which a group of college athletes sued the N.C.A.A. and 11 athletic conferences that participate in the top levels of basketball and football. They contended that the ruling bodies of college sports had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limits the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their universities. The N.C.A.A. and the conferences argue that those limits are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sports and undergraduate education.,"In her decision, Wilken seems to say that those rules “did restrain trade,” producing “significant anticompetitive effects.”","“The clerk,” Wilken added on the final page, with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement, “shall enter judgment for the Plaintiff class.”",So why doesn’t it feel as if the group of athletes who pursued the litigation to end the N.C.A.A.’s rule won the case? Why did they and their star sports labor lawyer Jeffrey Kessler not get the outcome they most fervently sought?,"Despite finding that the N.C.A.A. was violating federal law, Wilken turned away the plaintiffs’ main proposed remedy, which was also the logical one: to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation. That means the continuation of a status quo where so many players feel they are working basically for free. How’s that?","“When you apply a uniquely muddled set of laws to a unique industry, this is the kind of ruling you get,” said Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane’s sports law program and teaches antitrust law (the unique muddle to which he was referring).","The upshot of Friday’s ruling, pending a likely appeal, is that the N.C.A.A. may continue to cap payments to athletes after all — with the limited exception of expenses that are educational in nature. Think computers, or costs related to internships, or postgraduate scholarships.","Don’t think: stipends of $1,000, or $10,000, or $100,000, because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sales, and media exposure and television rights payments.",No wonder several of the defendants responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one does not expect from parties that technically lost a case.,"The decision “reaffirms the fundamental principles of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism,” Pacific-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. “Student-athletes are first and foremost students, who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life, while also pursuing athletic excellence.”",(Scott’s statement is more aspirational than descriptive: There are basketball players who conclude their college careers before finishing even a year of college.),"Similarly, the reaction from players’-rights advocates was more muted than you might expect postvictory.","“This is progress, but it’s just one step,” Ramogi Huma, of the College Athletes Players Association, said in a text message. “This ruling still treats athletes as second-class citizens. No other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic price-fixing, especially one imposed by a repeat antitrust violator that does not have an antitrust exemption.”",How can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continue?,"According to Feldman, the answer includes a much-disputed antitrust principle known as the rule of reason. In some cases — including this one — the rule calls for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefits of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition as much.","Wilken determined that amateurism was crucial to college sports’ commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sports, even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust law.","“The court does credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sports and professional sports,” she said.","Courts have given sports leagues a wide berth when it comes to antitrust, Feldman said: “The argument is that sports are unique.”","After all, sports cannot really exist unless, say, 353 teams are allowed to agree to the same rules in men’s basketball, even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commerce.","Wilken was also following precedent. Most of all, she was following a precedent set by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit — her circuit.","In an earlier case, known as O’Bannon, the appellate court agreed with part of a Wilken finding at the district court level that the N.C.A.A. ban on compensating athletes for the commercial use of their names, images and likenesses in things like video games was an antitrust violation. But the appellate judges overturned her proposal that athletes be able to receive up to $5,000 annually in exchange. The Ninth Circuit’s reasoning was that such payments were not “tethered to education.”","You can draw a direct line between that phrase, from 2015, and Wilken’s 2019 ruling in this case. That is how she Solomonically decided that the N.C.A.A. may restrict payments as long as they are noneducational.","“Future plaintiffs, if they challenge N.C.A.A. rules, will look for a jurisdiction outside of the Ninth Circuit,” Feldman said. The Ninth Circuit, after all, has now made it very clear it will defer to the N.C.A.A.","Another venue could rule in a more plaintiff-friendly direction. Kessler, the prominent sports lawyer, may now be able to push forward with a nearly identical case in Federal District Court in New Jersey.","Either way, the future of college athletics is now out of the hands of Wilken, who for nearly a decade has loomed over it.",Her decision last Friday may be a result of her understanding her power and its limits. Numerous observers expected a more plaintiff-friendly ruling based on the questions she asked during trial.,"Yet here we are, with little change.","“This finding did not surprise me,” said Gerald Gurney, a former head of the reform-minded Drake Group.","“Even though she may have wanted to completely agree with Kessler’s arguments,” Gurney added, “she did have some constraints.”"
U.S. Women’s Team Takes a Stand as Gender Disparities Remain Widespread - The New York Times,They work just as hard as men for less pay.,"When they complain, they are told they need to generate as much money as men do if they want to get paid as much as men are paid. When they say that’s essentially impossible without more opportunities and promotion, they are told opportunity and promotion will happen once they start producing more money.","This is the narrative at the heart of the gender discrimination lawsuit the United States women’s national soccer team filed on Friday against U.S. Soccer, but in nearly every sport, gender disparities in pay and working conditions are rampant.","Coming just three months before the start of the Women’s World Cup, the litigation immediately became the central plotline for the event and brought to the fore an issue that has increasingly rankled the sports world.",[Eight times women in sports fought for equality.],"In golf last year, the world’s top-ranked woman earned as much as the 33rd-best man. The United States women’s hockey team expected to have a victory tour after winning gold at the Pyeongchang Olympics last year. It didn’t happen. The N.B.A. minimum salary of $1.35 million for a player with one year of experience is higher than the salary cap for an entire W.N.B.A. roster.","“Unless the origin of the sport is anchored in women, like gymnastics or field hockey, I don’t think there’s a culture that starts with the premise: Women are going to be treated equally, or, we’re going to make up for the historical discrimination against women and make sure we’re going where we need to go,” said Donna Lopiano, a sports management consultant and former University of Texas athletics administrator, referring to both the national governing boards and to college sports.","According to the national women’s team’s suit against U.S. Soccer, differing systems of compensation for the men’s and women’s teams have led to the women repeatedly earning less than their male counterparts, even though the women are defending champions and the men failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.",Supporters of women’s sports praised the soccer team on Friday for taking a stand and trying to force the powers that be to address its complaints.,"“College sports has a great statute called Title IX,” said Nancy Hogshead-Makar, the chief executive of the advocacy group Champion Women.","“What it takes, though,” she added, “is 18- to 22-year-olds speaking up, because the adults in the room have abdicated that role of ensuring gender equity.”","Title IX — the 1972 landmark federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, including college sports — is nearly 50 years old. But advocates say that many universities fall short of the statute’s requirement that athletic opportunities must correlate with the overall student population. Both the college sports establishment and the federal government have evinced little interest in enforcing that requirement strictly.",Advocates say that the N.C.A.A. and its members have not sufficiently prioritized increasing funding for women’s sports.,"“If sports are being dropped, the money isn’t going to women’s sports — it’s going to the arms race in football and men’s basketball,” Lopiano said. “The culture is football and men’s basketball first. Boys first. Women are still at the back of the bus.”","Amy Wilson, the N.C.A.A. managing director of inclusion, said the N.C.A.A.’s member colleges, which create most policy, had no plans to further enforce Title IX to make up for the federal government’s failure to act.","“The thinking is, we’re here to run an organization with rules for our sports,” Wilson said.",A major challenge for female athletes has been to come up with a response to the argument that women deserve less money because their sports produce less money.,"Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, said that those who cling to a free-market argument fail to note the artificial advantages that men’s sports have long enjoyed. Men in the major team sports play in leagues that are monopolies, and have benefited from tens of millions of dollars in public subsidies that have helped finance and promote their endeavors.","“While the revenue disparity is a major component of this, it’s partly a result of the lack of promotion women have received,” Zimbalist said. “There is a lot of historical and cultural baggage to all of this.”",For all the gains that women have made in golf — the increase in playing opportunities in college and the integration of formerly all-male private clubs — the disparity in purses between the women of the L.P.G.A. Tour and the men of the PGA Tour continues to be striking.,"In 2018, the women’s leading money winner, Ariya Jutanugarn, won three events, including the United States Women’s Open, and posted 17 top-10 finishes in 28 starts. Her on-course earnings of $2,743,949 were surpassed by 33 players on the PGA Tour, led by Justin Thomas’s $8,694,821. Chesson Hadley, who ranked 33rd, did not record a victory and had seven top-10s in 30 starts on his way to $2,768,863. (The 33rd-ranked L.P.G.A. player, by comparison, earned $626,263.)","In 2016, the L.P.G.A. and PGA Tour formed a partnership with the stated aim of creating joint marketing programs and events and coordinating schedules. The alliance apparently does not cover certain fees that fall under the T.P.C. Network, which is part of the PGA Tour.","Brittany Lincicome, a two-time major champion, said that when she chooses to practice at T.P.C. Tampa Bay near her home she is required to pay cart fees. Card-carrying members of the PGA Tour incur no such fees.","What bothers Lincicome is not the fee per se, “but the principle of it,” she said. “I’m a well-known L.P.G.A. player.”","Two years ago, the future looked brighter for the United States women’s hockey team. Like the women’s soccer team, the hockey players were dominant in their sport internationally and far exceeded the achievements of the men’s national team.","After threatening to boycott the world championship tournament in 2017 in Plymouth Township, Mich., amid contract negotiations with U.S.A. Hockey for a living wage and more playing opportunities, the women’s team reached a deal that paid each player about $71,000 annually. That was a vast increase over the less than $10,000 that some of them had been making. The deal also provided the female players with travel and insurance provisions that equaled what the men’s national team received.","But the support for girls and women’s hockey that U.S.A. Hockey also promised then has been slow to develop. There are no women on U.S.A. Hockey’s marketing council. The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group, which was created in the 2017 deal, has only recently begun to have meaningful dialogue.","After earning the gold medal at the 2018 Olympics with a dramatic shootout victory over Canada, its archrival, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, visiting talk shows and N.H.L. games. But its post-Olympic exhibition tour never materialized. And there are currently no women’s player jerseys or jerseys in women’s sizes available at U.S.A. Hockey’s online stores.","“From a marketing standpoint, is it a huge missed opportunity?” Hilary Knight, the team’s star forward, said late last year. “Probably. We sort of disappeared from the summer.”","In tennis, women have pulled closer to pay equality than in any other major sport, with equal pay on the sport’s biggest stages. Tennis players routinely dominate lists of the highest-paid female athletes. But a closer look at the scoreboard each year would still show, “Advantage: Men.”","The four Grand Slam events and three other large tournaments — Indian Wells, Calif.; the Miami Open; and the Madrid Open — offer equal prize money to men and women, but women in the top 100 generally make only about 80 percent of the prize money their male counterparts make, because of lower pay at other tournaments.","At the Australian Open, Serena Williams spoke of how she talks often about equality on the different boards she sits on outside the sport. “Bringing that into tennis, as well, is something that’s superimportant. The only way to do it is to talk about it and to be open about it, have these conversations that aren’t necessarily comfortable.”","The biggest unresolved question in terms of how women are compensated for playing basketball right now is in the W.N.B.A., where the league and the players’ union are engaged in negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement.","Erin Kane, an agent with Octagon who represents Kristi Toliver, Elena Delle Donne and other W.N.B.A. players, said players were largely satisfied with how U.S.A. Basketball treated them.","“What the U.S.W.N.T. is doing is timely and inspiring,” Kane said of the soccer lawsuit. “When it comes to money, change is always a fight.”","W.N.B.A. players, many of whom play overseas in their off-season to earn more money, are pushing for quality training resources that are consistent across the league and on a par with the N.B.A.","Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, said the league’s compensation system is dependent on its revenues. “We want nothing more than for W.N.B.A. players to receive the recognition they deserve for being world-class athletes,” he said. “And as we work with the W.N.B.P.A. to improve the economics of the league, we also challenge the broader basketball and sports community to support the W.N.B.A. and its athletes.”","Chiney Ogwumike, a member of the union’s executive committee, said that for too long W.N.B.A. players have been told to be grateful for what they have.","“Our goal is to educate people to respect the fact that we too are the best of the best at what we do,” she said."
"The New A.A.F. Is Betting on Football, and on Betting - The New York Times","There are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.","Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.","The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.","“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.","Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.","“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”","To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.","But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.","Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.","MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.","“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”","Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.","The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.","But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.","“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”","Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.","“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”","Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.","And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.","“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”","For now, he is preaching patience.","“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”"

Trump Says He Will Give Tiger Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom - The New York Times,"A day after Tiger Woods won his fifth Masters title and 15th major tournament in a rousing resurrection of his career, President Trump said Monday he would give him an honor almost as exclusive as a green jacket from Augusta National Golf Club: the Presidential Medal of Freedom.","Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he would bestow the award, without saying when. “Because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more important, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!,” Mr. Trump wrote.","The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, and is awarded to those who make outstanding contributions to national security or national interest, world peace, culture or other public or private endeavors. The medal has been awarded since 1963, and is typically given to a dozen or fewer people each year.","Over the years numerous sports figures have received it, especially under the presidencies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Mr. Trump, all noted sports fans.","Just last year Babe Ruth, Roger Staubach and Alan Page were awarded Presidential Medals of Freedom. Woods will not be the first golfer to get the award; Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus were honored in consecutive years in the mid-2000s, and Charles Sifford, the first African-American to play on the PGA Tour, was honored in 2014. But it is rare for an active athlete to receive the honor.","Mr. Woods has a longstanding relationship with Mr. Trump, an avid golfer. They own property near each other in Florida and have golfed together a number of times, both before and after Mr. Trump became president.","In February, Mr. Trump tweeted a picture of himself with Woods and Nicklaus at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla. The next day, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “Tiger is back & will be winning Majors again!”",Over the years Mr. Trump has repeatedly tweeted about watching Mr. Woods play golf.,"They are also business partners. Mr. Woods is designing the course at the Trump World Golf Club Dubai, set to open in 2019.","Mr. Woods acknowledges having played golf with Mr. Trump and having eaten together, but otherwise is reluctant to speak about their relationship. “Well, he’s the president of the United States,” Mr. Woods said last year. “You have to respect the office.”","Still, while several African-American athletes have criticized Mr. Trump or kept their distance, Mr. Woods, who is of African-American and Thai descent, has maintained his relationship with him.","When asked last August after a tournament if he had any thoughts about race relations in America, Mr. Woods demurred. “No, I just finished 72 holes,” he said. “And really hungry.”"
"Players Hold Power Over the N.C.A.A., if They Feel the Hunger - The New York Times","MINNEAPOLIS — This Final Four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective, if inadvertent, instances of athlete activism in college sports.","This was when the Connecticut star Shabazz Napier, speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game, said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat.","“There are hungry nights that I go to bed and I’m starving,” he said.","Within weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s board of directors for Division I voted to lift restrictions on how much teams could feed their players. No longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal (notoriously, serving peanuts did not count, while serving peanut butter did). Now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts.",This common-sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually. But the stark comments by a high-profile player at the N.C.A.A.’s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the N.C.A.A.’s power over college athletes.,"It is fruitful to remember the efficacy of Napier’s comments, because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports’ much-maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within. The players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change.","What would have happened if Zion Williamson had said, after his Nike shoe exploded, jeopardizing his career, that enough was enough, that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by Nike? And that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy, either?","“The power is with labor and the players,” said Kain Colter, the former Northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago.","This was most obviously displayed in 2015, when Missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired. He stepped down. That the boycott concerned the campus’s racial climate rather than the players’ compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened: The players — unpaid, un-unionized — flexed their muscles, and the system gave in.","Vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant. From Jackie Robinson withstanding taunts, threats and worse to break Major League Baseball’s color line; to baseball players striking in the 1970s and ’80s to gain and keep full-fledged free agency; to the track standout Edwin Moses devising benefits for Olympic athletes, athletes have often been the ones bringing about change. Their leverage is unmatched: They are the ones the fans pay to see, and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit.","And they are the only ones with a steady interest in, well, their own interest.",Consider what else has happened since Napier’s comments.,"Colter’s unionization effort, which a National Labor Relations Board regional director endorsed weeks before Napier’s Final Four, was squashed by the overall board.",The antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players.,"Last month, a second antitrust suit, which sought to explode the N.C.A.A.’s ban on compensation, concluded at the district-court level with a technical victory for players that looked as much like a victory for the establishment. A federal judge ruled that the N.C.A.A. could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education.","“The courts are not a forum where you’re going to get relief,” said Don Yee, a sports lawyer and players-rights advocate.","For Yee, who also happens to be Tom Brady’s agent, the solution is “private entrepreneurialism.” He is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the N.F.L. (which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school). It would be developmental, like college football, but unlike college football, average pay would be $50,000.","A planned summer basketball league, the Historical Basketball League, would pay scholarships for its college-level players while enabling them to sell their names, images and likenesses to sponsors. The N.B.A.’s development league plans to offer higher salaries. The probable dissolution of the one-and-done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the N.B.A. instead of having to spend at least a year in college.","A few states, notably North Carolina and California, have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if, say, a video game uses their names and likenesses.","All these efforts are well intentioned. But if past is prologue, the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion.",Nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition.,"At a news conference in Minneapolis last week, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports’ governance.","“I’m a lifelong academic,” he said. “I grew up with that tradition, and I never worked at a school that didn’t have students on their board, and they were full voting board members. They voted on my contract, and I think that’s just perfectly appropriate.”","There are athletes serving on several important councils, but there is not one on the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors. No athletes vote on Emmert’s contract, which was extended late last year through 2023.","Tim Nevius, a onetime N.C.A.A. investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system, believes the answer lies with player activism. Last month, he announced a new organization, the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the N.C.A.A. with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players.","He acknowledged in an interview the challenges, including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes, as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power. But he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change.","“There are powers here that the athletes have,” he said, “and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands.”","Ros Gold-Unwude, a Turner Sports analyst and former Stanford basketball player, said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order.","“That’s the way our culture is, where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms,” she said.","“If you’re really struggling or hungry,” she added, “that experience will come out.”","Apathy will come out as well, though. Beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it, a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets.","Napier, who is now a reserve on the Nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article, said more during his “hungry nights” speech heard ’round the world, even though it received less publicity.","He noted that there were other wrongs. Players’ jerseys were sold to fans, and the players did not receive a cut. More basically, he said, the players were not paid.","It was, he suggested, wrong. Probably.","“Something can change, something should change,” Napier said five years ago. “But if it doesn’t, at the end of the day, we’ve been doing this for so long.”"
"Zion Williamson Will Be Fine, but His Teammates Might Not Be - The New York Times","When Zion Williamson of Duke went down with a severed shoe and a sprained knee 30 seconds into Wednesday night’s showdown with North Carolina, it was bad news for plenty involved. Williamson now has to deal with an injury. Duke had to play its archrival without its best player and duly lost, 88-72. Nike faced questions about its product’s apparent failure.","But ESPN, broadcasting the contest as part of its multibillion-dollar deal with the Atlantic Coast Conference, did just fine. The game’s biggest star was injured for nearly 99 percent of the game, yet on Thursday, the network reported that the rivalry had produced its highest-ever ratings for a weeknight college basketball game.","The episode crystallized the economic limitations that N.C.A.A. amateurism and N.B.A. rules impose on Williamson, a preternatural talent, and the unique ways that they limit the income of a unique player.","If the N.B.A. did not bar high schoolers from heading straight to the league — a rule that may disappear in a few years — then Williamson could already have been playing for, say, the Atlanta Hawks and making several million dollars on his rookie contract. If N.C.A.A. rules did not prevent players from signing endorsements, Williamson could already have been receiving millions from Nike.","However, barring an outright catastrophe, Williamson, the likely top draft pick, will be getting paid, soon and well, and at a time when his economic productivity is even higher than it is today. His specialness, though, obscures what some suggest is the greatest injustice of college sports’ policy of amateurism.","In contrast to Williamson and a few other superstars, most players in college basketball are denied the right to cash in during what is very likely their moment of peak economic value.","“The top guys are worth a lot — on the order of millions a year,” said Daniel Rascher, a sports economist who has studied the economic value of college athletes. “But the seven, eight, nine guys,” he added, referring to the players further down the depth chart, “are going to be several hundred thousand a year in terms of the incremental revenue they bring to the school.”","Take Duke’s Jordan Goldwire. He was a midrated recruit out of high school, and his options besides Duke included midmajor programs such as Eastern Kentucky, Coastal Carolina and Nevada-Las Vegas. He is probably not bound for N.B.A. riches. This season, he has not played at all in three A.C.C. games and has averaged fewer than seven minutes in those he has played in. He played eight minutes against the Tar Heels on Wednesday. But that actually made him an essential contributor to a two-hour broadcast worth a lot of money to Duke, the A.C.C. and ESPN.","“If you look at the N.B.A., the guys who don’t play very much still get paid a lot,” Rascher said.","Or forget about Duke and think of the players at whichever team makes the N.C.A.A. tournament out of the Big South or the Patriot League. Part of that billion-dollar event’s charm comes from the quirky matchups — and the potential for exciting upsets — when such teams face juggernauts like Duke and Kansas in the early rounds. Players on those teams, too, are producing a real financial return for the N.C.A.A., for its member colleges and for CBS and Turner Sports, even though their abilities will never be remotely so lucrative again. Yet they are prohibited from taking more than a relatively small, prescribed share of that value.","Moreover, all of these players, too, are risking futures in professional basketball — more of them than you might think. While fewer than 5 percent of Division I men’s basketball players are drafted into the N.B.A., the N.C.A.A. said last year, around half go on to play pro basketball in some form, such as in foreign leagues. From teams in the five top conferences, the N.C.A.A. added, more than three-quarters of players go on to be paid to play.",The college sports establishment’s common rebuttal to these lines of thinking is that not paying the players beyond scholarships and related costs is actually crucial to the popularity of their sports.,"Last year, in a federal lawsuit challenging the N.C.A.A.’s restrictions on compensation from an antitrust perspective, Mike Aresco, a former sports television executive who is now commissioner of the American Athletic Conference, testified that college players’ amateur status was a feature of their sports’ appeal, not a bug.","“It resonated with fans because it wasn’t professionalized at all,” he said, according to a court transcript, while serving as a witness for several conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. “And it was presented and framed as college students, as college sports.”","Among other things, this distinction differentiated college basketball and college football from minor league sports, Aresco said. “And that was very important,” he added, “because minor leagues had never been popular.”",He said: “People view college sports separately. And we always maintained that separation.”,"Rascher was a witness for the plaintiffs in that case, in which a decision is expected any day. His reply to arguments like Aresco’s was to point to the experiment of sorts that took place a few years ago, when the N.C.A.A. permitted colleges to offer athletes funds that included the so-called full cost of attendance. After players began to be “paid” slightly more than they had previously been, college sports’ popularity was not measurably affected.","Williamson’s injury in the marquee game of the regular season, particularly so early in the contest, appeared to be a devastating blow to Duke, which entered as a 9-point favorite yet never led once. Being magnanimous, Roy Williams, North Carolina’s colorful coach, acknowledged as much afterward.","“Be honest,” he said. “When the big fella goes out of the game, it changes a lot of stuff for them.”","Judging from the final score, Williams was right. But be honest: If you looked only at the bottom line, you would not even know that the big fella was gone."
Tiger Woods' Victory in Masters a Win for Golf Business - The New York Times,"(Reuters) - Tiger Woods' victory at the Masters golf tournament on Sunday, his first major victory since 2008, is expected to lift sales for sponsors, broadcasters and golf courses lucky enough to host a tournament with Woods playing.",The competition put the 43-year-old back on top of a sport he helped transform 25 years ago. ,"""Tiger sells golf,"" says Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, Inc., a Michigan analytics firm. Apex found that Nike earned $22.5 million worth of brand exposure just from Woods’ final round, with Nike’s ""Swoosh"" logo splashed on his hat, shirt, pants and shoes. Nike stock was up about one percent on Monday. ","Tournament broadcaster CBS Corp saw a ratings bump. Based on preliminary data, the final round of Sunday's tournament was the highest-rated morning golf broadcast since 1986, when CBS started collecting that data. The tournament, which is usually broadcast in the afternoon, was rescheduled to the morning because of weather.","CBS has the rights to the PGA Championship in May and expects prices for advertising time that is still available to rise as a result of Woods' Masters victory, according to a source familiar with the matter.","The golf demographic is wealthier and better-educated than other sports fans, so TV ratings are valued more highly because they’re more apt to turn into sales, even of big-ticket items, said Neal Pilson, president of Pilson Communications and former president of CBS Sports. ","“Historically, events where Tiger Woods is on leaderboards on Sunday generated 30 to 40 percent higher ratings in the United States for those tournaments,” Pilson said. ",MAKINGS OF A COMEBACK,"Woods was a 20-year-old prodigy when he turned pro in 1996. Less than a year later he was ranked No. 1 in the world. He struck lucrative endorsement deals - including a five-year, $40 million deal with Nike - and golf experienced a surge in popularity. ","Then Woods' personal life collapsed and with it, his brand. In 2009, after the news of multiple infidelities, he lost endorsement deals with companies like AT&T Inc and Accenture Plc. Other sponsors, such as Procter & Gamble Co's Gillette and Berkshire Hathaway Inc's NetJets, kept their contracts with Woods but stopped using him in marketing. ","Four back surgeries later, Woods continued to suffer professionally and in the public eye. In 2017 police arrested him for driving under the influence; he pleaded guilty to reckless driving and entered a program for first-time offenders. ","In 2018 Woods began a professional comeback that culminated at Sunday's Masters. After his victory, Nike, which stood behind Woods throughout his darker years, posted an ad on its website titled “Tiger Woods: Same Dream.""","“In sports you have heroes, villains and underdogs,"" said Benjamin Hordell, founder of digital marketing and advertising firm DXagency. ""Tiger has lived all of it. That’s amazing from a storytelling perspective. People will root against him, but they’re watching.""

","Russia has been rocked by several sporting bans in recent years after international investigations found evidence of widespread, state-sponsored doping in athletics and a string of other sports.","The amendments, which envisage fines of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for drug cheats, must still be approved by the upper chamber of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin before they become law.","Russian legislation already considers it a crime for coaches and medical staff to coerce athletes into doping, but there have so far not been any convictions under that law.

Virginia is now on the verge of writing a new chapter — one that arguably wouldn't be appreciated by nearly as many people were it not for the huge platform Virginia hoops helped create.","The Cavaliers play Texas Tech for the NCAA Tournament title Monday with a chance to add ""national champion"" to a resume already brimming with color and characters.","""University of Virginia holds a unique place in college basketball,"" said Craig Littlepage, the program's former longtime athletic director and one-time assistant basketball coach.

Less than two weeks before that, it had been Virginia vs. Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in a meeting then billed as the Game of the Decade .","Virginia stood front-and-center in what college basketball was becoming in the early 1980s, a few years after Larry Bird and Magic Johnson set the stage with their epic meeting in the 1979 national final.",But that Chaminade game broke through the sports pages and onto to the front pages.

Admissions Scandal Stokes Hard Questions on Recruited Athletes - The New York Times,"A dozen years ago, the University of Washington barred athletic coaches from having contact with anyone in the admissions department.","With a move that now seems prescient, two new administrators supervising athletics sought to allay any concerns that coaches could put undue pressure on admissions personnel. The change also brought more oversight to athletics, in this case through a committee of senior faculty members, deans and other university representatives.","The previous arrangement, said Philip Ballinger, an associate vice provost now overseeing admissions, “didn’t have sufficient transparency; it didn’t have enough eyes on it.”","The leeway coaches get in recruiting has long been a point of discussion in higher education circles. But after federal investigators last week revealed a broad admissions cheating scandal, a number of colleges began asking hard questions about how they evaluate athletic applicants and oversee the chosen few whom coaches recommend for admission.","In what prosecutors described as the biggest case of admissions fraud they had investigated, 50 people were accused in a scheme that involved paying bribes to coaches and to people who monitor admissions tests in order to fraudulently get the children of wealthy patrons into some of the nation’s most elite colleges.",Some students were accepted as recruited athletes even though they did not play the sports described in their applications. They gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admissions spots to athletes who might not get in otherwise.,"This process has been followed for decades in the pursuit of competitive teams, which burnish a university’s reputation, inspire alumni loyalty and often help with fund-raising.","Now, the fraud case has sent a thunderbolt through the higher education community.","“Every college president in America called his athletic director the morning after that admissions fraud story broke and asked: How do we make sure this doesn’t happen at our school?” said Bill Martin, the athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. “And certain athletic directors were smart enough to call their presidents first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athlete.”","Indeed, at Yale University, where F.B.I. investigators say the longtime women’s soccer coach accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer, the university president, Peter Salovey, announced late last week that new oversight policies had already been put in place. The Yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit’s credentials before admission, and recruited athletes who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive “close scrutiny,” a university statement said.","A broad overhaul of athletic admissions systems in Division I, the highest level of N.C.A.A. competition and the level the colleges in the scheme compete in, has been overdue, according to several athletic administrators interviewed in recent days.","Battles over blue-chip recruits in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized. In those upper echelon sports, if there is money changing hands, it is from coaches to recruits, not the other way around.","But in the lower-profile sports like crew, volleyball, tennis and soccer — often called the Olympic sports — there has been more room for bribes and exploitation. And the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect as a “recruited walk-on.” In nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credentials cited in last week’s indictments, from Stanford to Texas to Yale, the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walk-on.",Such applicants are not even assured a spot on the team. But they are often on a list of five to 20 athletes — it varies from sport to sport — that a coach is permitted to submit to the admissions department.,"The two daughters of the actress Lori Loughlin, who was charged in connection with the fraud case last week, were passed off as crew recruits despite never having competed in the sport, according to federal prosecutors.","That choice of sport may not have been an accident. In a sport like women’s crew, where rosters can balloon to 125 athletes, many teams have scores of recruited walk-ons. (Such large rosters can help a college comply with federal equality laws, balancing out the number of male athletes in football.)","“When the rosters are that big, like they are in women’s crew, I could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person as a recruited walk-on,” said Martin, who added that Michigan annually audited team rosters.","The recruitment of athletes in such sports may be an even bigger factor in the admissions process at colleges in the N.C.A.A.’s lowest tier, Division III, where athletic scholarships are forbidden.","Division III is also the largest tier, with nearly 450 institutions, including many of the country’s most selective small liberal arts colleges, where acceptance rates can be as low as 15 percent. These colleges might field as many as 30 teams from enrollments as small as 2,000, with varsity athletes, many of them afforded an advantage in admissions, making up 30 percent to 45 percent of the student body.","These small colleges, like the largest ones, also give preferential treatment to applicants who excel in music, the arts and a host of other skills. There are also allowances for students from the least-populated states.","“Admissions is filling all the different buckets,” said Wendy Smith, the athletic director at Haverford College, a highly rated institution near Philadelphia. “And our athletes are right in there. We are not in any way gaming the system. They are absolutely on par academically.”",The cost of fielding a successful sports team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads to other troubling conflicts of interest.,"In the Ivy League, for example, most coaches are responsible for fund-raising that bridges the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully. That can lead to uncomfortable decisions about composing a team, especially since athletes’ families often become the leading donors.","“You have a family who will give you $25,000, but then you are not going to play their daughter?” said Paul Wardlaw, who was the women’s tennis coach at Brown University for 14 years.","“The whole scandal is interesting, and it’s human nature to take the easy route,” he said, “but there are some systematic issues that are contributing to this.”","At many elite institutions, the notion that recruited athletes have been granted an unfair advantage is palpable.","Cameron Green, a tight end on the football team at Northwestern University, which accepts about 13 percent of applicants, conceded that several of his high school classmates who did not play sports had applied to Northwestern and been rejected.","“It’s easier for athletes to get in, so I know that’s hard for regular students,” said Green, a senior who does not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility. “A lot of kids I knew were confused when I got in and they didn’t, but you know, at the end of the day, the school looks at your demographics on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet you.”","The high percentage of recruited athletes at some colleges, particularly smaller ones, has other consequences, some of them at odds with institutional ambitions for a diverse student body.","Because success in youth sports today often comes more easily to affluent families who spend copiously on private instruction, the rosters of college teams have become predominantly white — nearly 80 percent at some small schools.","In the end, some in the higher education community believe that last week’s admissions fraud scandal, while an embarrassing lesson in what policy changes need to be made, is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admissions procedures at American colleges.","“There is now this notion that admissions is a competitive cesspool, and it’s not,” said Michael Reilly, the executive director of the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers. “In fact,” Reilly added, “most campuses nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goals. But then we have this segment that’s highly competitive and has created a completely different dynamic.

Mike Trout, the center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels, is finalizing a contract extension that will be worth about $430 million and keep him with the team through 2030, according to two people who were briefed on the deal but were not authorized to comment publicly.","However the deal is calculated — either an additional $360 million over 10 years or the Angels’ total commitment of about $430 million for the next 12 years — Trout has eclipsed the previous record for guaranteed money: the 13-year, $330 million deal Bryce Harper signed this month with the Philadelphia Phillies.","The extension, which was first reported by ESPN, would establish Trout as the highest-paid baseball player on an annual basis, topping the $34.4 million Zack Greinke is earning from the Arizona Diamondbacks on a six-year, $206.5 million contract signed in December 2015.","[From 2017: Mike Trout, Baseball’s Best Without the Brand]","While it is an enormous amount of money, even this record-breaking contract doesn’t necessarily bring Trout into the highest tier of overall income for professional athletes.","While comparing contracts across sports and continents is an inherently difficult undertaking because of varied contractual structures, tax burdens, bonuses and ancillary benefits, it is clear that even with the monster deal Trout would fall well short of becoming the world’s highest paid athlete annually.","The soccer superstar Lionel Messi, for example, is expected to earn more than 106 million euros (about $120 million) per year from Barcelona through 2021, an amount that could rise to 120 million euros if certain incentives are met. The boxer Canelo Álvarez will earn at least $73 million annually from a five-year deal with the streaming service DAZN.","Trout, 27, also won’t have the highest annual salary in North American team sports. In the N.B.A., Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors is making $37.5 million this season, and the Houston Rockets’ James Harden will earn $42.3 million annually once his four-year, $169.3 million contract extension kicks in.","The highest-paid N.F.L. player, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, earns a bit less than Trout is expected to: an average of $33.5 million from a four-year, $134 million contract (though only $98.7 million of that is guaranteed). Unlike Major League Baseball, the N.F.L. and N.B.A. have salary caps.","Compared with superstars in other sports, Trout has a limited ability to earn money outside the game. Baseball players typically aren’t as well-known nationally or internationally as their counterparts in other major sports, and Trout’s lack of marketability has been lamented by M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred.","Trout does have a number of endorsement deals with companies including Rawlings and Nike, and in 2014 he became of the first baseball player since Ken Griffey Jr. to get a Nike signature cleat. But baseball players’ ability to move merchandise pales in comparison to that of a basketball player or a soccer player, and endorsement contracts reflect that.","Trout earns an estimated $2.5 million from endorsements annually, according to Forbes. Kevin Durant’s endorsement deal with Nike alone is worth up to $300 million over 10 years, while Harden will earn $200 million over 13 years from Adidas. LeBron James of the N.B.A. and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese soccer star for Juventus, have lifetime deals with Nike that are rumored to be worth $1 billion each.","While a handful of athletes earn more from their contracts annually than Trout, those individuals almost assuredly will not be doing so in 2030, the final year of Trout’s deal. N.B.A. contracts last a maximum of five years, and with a few exceptions, soccer contracts are rarely longer than that, either. Boxers typically earn their money fight to fight, while golf and tennis players simply claim a share of tournament prize money.","But in 2030, no matter how Trout’s baseball career progresses, he will earn at least $36 million — a priceless long-term assurance.","He has earned the payout by putting together seven astounding seasons to begin his career; the most similar players, production-wise, at his age, according to Baseball Reference, have been the Hall of Famers Frank Robinson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mickey Mantle. Trout has won two American League Most Valuable Player Awards and been the runner-up four times. His career batting average is .307 and he is the majors’ active leader in on-base plus slugging percentage, at .990.","But, adding to Trout’s lack of recognition and earning power, postseason success has eluded him. He has reached the playoffs just once, in 2014, when the Angels were swept by the Kansas City Royals in a division series. The possibility of Trout departing for a new team loomed after the 2020 season, when his six-year, $144.5 million contract was set to expire; Harper, for one, had said he would love for Trout to join him in Philadelphia.","Trout still lives in his hometown, Millville, N.J., in the off-season, and is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan. But the Angels had tried to impress upon Trout the benefits of keeping his work and home lives separate, and to sell him on the idea of being a one-team icon with a franchise with which he has thrived. And with a promise of an enormous paycheck — at least for on-field performance — the Angels put together a winning pitch."

LSU Reinstates Men's Basketball Coach Wade - The New York Times,"Although noting ""regrets"" that LSU men's basketball coach Will Wade didn't comply with the school several weeks ago when asked about recruiting issues, athletic director Joe Alleva announced in a statement Sunday that Wade's month-plus suspension has been lifted.",The university suspended Wade on March 8 because it said he refused to meet with school officials amid scrutiny of a reported FBI wiretap capturing the coach talking about an offer to then-recruit Javonte Smart. Wade missed the Tigers' final regular-season game and all of their SEC and NCAA Tournament games.,"Assistant coach Tony Benford took over as head coach and led LSU to the SEC regular-season title with a win over Vanderbilt in his first game, then led the Tigers to the Sweet 16, where they lost to Michigan State.","Wade was reinstated after he met with Alleva and NCAA compliance officials on Friday, Alleva said in the statement, adding that he saw no place where Wade violated his contract, allowing for his reinstatement.","""During those meetings, he answered all questions and denied any wrongdoing in connection with recently reported allegations of irregularities in college basketball recruiting,"" Alleva said.","The statement also said the university ""regrets that Coach Wade did not choose to fulfill his obligations to LSU when he was first asked to do so. However, the seriousness of the allegations and Coach Wade's prior refusal to refute them could not be ignored without exposing the University and basketball program to great risk. Protecting LSU and preserving our integrity must always be our first priority. Coach Wade's explanations and clarifications offered during the meeting, absent actual evidence of misconduct, satisfy his contractual obligation to LSU.""","The alleged offer to Smart arose in a conversation Wade was having with Christian Dawkins, described as a middleman in the scandal of paying basketball recruits. Dawkins was convicted on felony charges of wire fraud last year and sentenced last month to six months in prison. The specifics of that case were unrelated to Dawkins' reported interaction with Wade.","ESPN and Yahoo Sports reported last month that a wiretap caught Wade upset about not landing Smart at that point despite a ""strong-ass offer."" CBS Sports described Smart as a top-50 recruit from Baton Rouge. He ultimately signed with the Tigers.","""I was thinking last night on this Smart thing,"" Wade reportedly said to Dawkins on the wiretap.

Bob Costas Accuses NBC of Retaliating for His Remarks on Concussions in N.F.L. - The New York Times,"Bob Costas, the longtime sportscaster and prime-time host on NBC, alleged in an interview that aired on Sunday that the network’s executives abruptly removed him from covering last year’s Super Bowl after he criticized the violence in football and how the “game destroys people’s brains.”","His nearly 40-year relationship with NBC Sports, first as its boyish announcer and later as elder statesman, came crashing down over five days in November 2017. At a symposium that month with fellow journalists, Mr. Costas remarked on what he saw as the life-altering dangers of the sport, devastating consequences for its players and existential questions confronting the National Football League.","“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains — not everyone’s, but a substantial number,” Mr. Costas told the crowd at the University of Maryland. “It’s not a small number, it’s a considerable number. It destroys their brains.”","His highly critical remarks, while in line with his past public comments about the link between playing football and head trauma, including an hourlong NBC special about it in 2013, quickly grabbed headlines and cast an uncomfortable spotlight on NBC Sports just months before it would broadcast the N.F.L.’s biggest and most lucrative event, the Super Bowl.","At the end of that week in November, Mr. Costas appeared on the CNN program “Smerconish” in what he later described as an effort to soften the reaction to his remarks. He said that network executives had been well aware of his thoughts about football and that “NBC Sports deserves credit” for supporting him as he expressed his views.","Still, network executives were seething, according to Mr. Costas, setting in motion his removal from the network’s Super Bowl plan and his eventual departure from NBC. Mr. Costas spoke about the episode with ESPN last year for a story that aired Sunday on “Outside the Lines.”","Within an hour of his appearance on CNN, he said, he received a text message from Sam Flood, an executive producer at NBC. “I think the words were, ‘You’ve crossed the line,’” Mr. Costas told ESPN, adding that he no longer had the text message.","Mr. Costas told ESPN that he believed his remarks had cut too close to the delicate, multibillion-dollar business relationship between the N.F.L. and the networks that carry the games.","“Look, the N.F.L. isn’t just the most important sports property, it’s the single most important property in all of American television,” Mr. Costas said. “And it isn’t even close.”","An NBC Sports spokesman confirmed that Mr. Costas had been told that he had “crossed the line” but said it was not because he had discussed the topic of brain injuries and football. Instead, the spokesman said, it was because Mr. Costas had agreed after the University of Maryland symposium that he would no longer discuss the topic in interviews without prior approval from NBC Sports.","He had not sought approval for the CNN interview, the spokesman, Greg Hughes, said on Monday.","Shortly after the CNN appearance, Mr. Costas said, he was told he would not be part of NBC’s coverage of Super Bowl LII in February 2018. It was a sudden breakup between NBC and Mr. Costas, its longtime host of the Olympics and of “Football Night in America,” the network’s highly rated Sunday N.F.L. pregame show. Last year, he described the separation in public as “mutually agreeable.”","The parting was the culmination of Mr. Costas’s wavering commitment over many years to covering the N.F.L. He stepped away from NBC’s coverage in the 1990s, later saying the decision was because he “had ambivalent feelings about football.” Yet he was a host of HBO’s “Inside the N.F.L.” in the 2000s and then rejoined NBC’s coverage of the sport in the 2006-7 season, when the network started a $600 million-a-year deal with the league for Sunday night games. He continued hosting that program, “Sunday Night Football,” for the next decade, as awareness about the long-term effects of head injuries continued to rise.","During that time, Mr. Costas used the top-rated show’s platform to provide commentary on everything from guns to politics. In a halftime commentary in 2012, Mr. Costas called for “enlightened legislation and controls” on guns a day after a Kansas City Chiefs player shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself.","The network never received criticism or complaints from the N.F.L. about Mr. Costas’s coverage or commentary, including his remarks at the 2017 symposium, Mr. Hughes said.","By the time Mr. Costas appeared at that event, he had already taken a back seat in NBC’s coverage. He hosted the first “Football Night in America” of the 2017-18 football season but then handed off the remaining shows to Mike Tirico, who had moved over from ESPN to become NBC’s face of major sports events. When NBC eventually announced that Mr. Costas would not participate in the Super Bowl broadcast, he said that it would not have been fair to those who had been there the entire season.","“It wouldn’t be right for me to parachute in and do the Super Bowl,” he told The Associated Press weeks before the event. NBC and Mr. Costas officially parted ways last fall, when they agreed to end his contract early."
"Finally, the N.B.A. Comes to Charlotte - The New York Times","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — As the N.B.A. prepares for All-Star Game festivities this weekend in Charlotte, N.C., the backdrop to the celebration is unequivocally political, as nearly everything in the divided state seems to be these days.","The event was supposed to have been in Charlotte in 2017. But in March 2016, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law, known as House Bill 2 or HB2, that invalidated local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the genders listed on their birth certificates.","Supporters called the law a necessary public safety measure, but opponents condemned it as intolerant, and a backlash emerged, chasing away businesses, conventions and concerts and testing sports leagues that are normally averse to political debates.","The N.B.A. moved the All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans. The N.C.A.A. and the Atlantic Coast Conference removed championship games and tournaments from the state, a stunning blow given the hold college basketball has over North Carolina.","Political scientists say the law contributed when the governor at the time, Pat McCrory, a Republican, lost his subsequent re-election bid by 10,000 votes.","“There was a sense that the election was a referendum on HB2, and a verdict was rendered,” said Pope McCorkle, a professor of public policy at Duke University and a former Democratic political consultant.","A year later, with the N.C.A.A. saying the state had 48 hours to change the law or lose the chance to host any N.C.A.A. championship games through 2022, House Bill 2 was partially repealed. ","That was enough for the N.B.A., and it has allowed Charlotte to present itself as a welcoming place, however much some activists believe the repeal did not go far enough.","For sports organizations, the partial repeal, known as HB142, allowed them to return to the state, a growing and important market. Within weeks, the N.C.A.A. and the A.C.C. returned championship games to North Carolina, and the N.B.A. quickly awarded Charlotte the 2019 All-Star Game. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said that he understood concerns that the repeal did not go far enough but that he believed it eliminated “the most egregious aspects of the prior law.”",That the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A. found themselves in the middle of a pitched political brawl in the Tar Heel state was fitting. Sports have long been intertwined with politics in North Carolina.,"Kenan Memorial Stadium, where the University of North Carolina’s football teams have played for 90 years, was originally named for William R. Kenan, a 19th century merchant who led the massacre of dozens of black residents of Wilmington. In 2018, the university decided to name the stadium instead for his son, William R. Kenan. Jr., a former university trustee and businessman.","In the 1960s, Dean Smith, the longtime coach of North Carolina’s basketball team, was a force for integration and civil rights in the state. More recently, former North Carolina athletes helped end plans to return a Confederate monument to campus.","Activists and Democratic politicians praise the role sports organizations played in overturning House Bill 2, but only to a point. The partial repeal overturned the portions of the law dealing with restrooms but largely left the other provisions intact. They see it as a less discriminatory law that is far from perfect.","“Philosophically, it wasn’t the correct fix, but it achieved a good objective,” said Representative Deb Butler, a Democrat and one of North Carolina’s few openly gay lawmakers. She voted against the partial repeal.","Kathy Behrens, the N.B.A.’s president of social responsibility, said the league has equality principles that each arena, vendor, hotel or other business the N.B.A. works with for the All-Star Game is required to adhere to.","Among other requirements, she said, each partner must “ensure that any restroom it provides for its personnel or the general public will be open for use by all individuals consistent with their gender identities.”","Still, some states, including New York and California, maintain bans against any official state travel to North Carolina. Netflix recently opted to film “OBX,” which is set in North Carolina’s Outer Banks, in South Carolina because of the bill. A lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging portions of the bill is pending.","“This debate should never have been about sports,” said Chris Brook, the legal director of the A.C.L.U. of North Carolina. “Basketball is something of a religion here in North Carolina, but HB2 and HB142 at bottom are about people’s lives and their rights to live a public life.”","North Carolina’s political battles continue. The Supreme Court will rule this year on partisan gerrymandering in the state, and one of the North Carolina’s seats in the House of Representatives remains vacant because of credible voter fraud allegations. A bloody state budget battle looms.","For the moment, though, sports is not on the docket."

Athlete Body Says NOCs Should Lead on Sponsorship Freedom - The New York Times,"LONDON — National Olympic Committees should take the lead in helping athletes win more freedom to promote their personal sponsors during Games, the head of the Global Athlete movement said on Monday.","Rule 40 of the Olympic charter states that participants in the Olympic Games cannot allow their ""person, name, picture or sports performances to be used for advertising purposes during the Olympic Games.""","The German Cartel Office ruled in February, however, that the IOC and German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB) were subject to competition laws and must grant more rights for promotional activities ahead of and during the Games.",The ruling only applies in Germany and IOC President Thomas Bach was quoted as saying at the weekend that other athletes should talk directly to their National Olympic Committee (NOC) or federation.,"""We welcome the fact that the IOC is now starting to raise this issue, which has long been on the minds of the overwhelming majority of Olympic athletes,"" said Global Athlete director general Rob Koehler.","""This is a first step to recognizing the growing mood among the athlete community to have their marketing and commercial rights liberated at an Olympic Games.""",Koehler told Reuters that he would have preferred the IOC to put the onus on NOCs rather than leaving it up to athletes who lacked the staff and time.,"""I would have liked to see it flipped around a little bit saying ‘responsibility on the NOCs to see what we can do to help you athletes’,"" he said.",The insidethegames.biz website quoted Bach on Sunday as telling the International Athletes' Forum in Lausanne that there was no one-size-fits-all solution.,"""What we are doing now is actively contacting NOCs and starting talks advising them of what we agreed after the DOSB negotiated this with the Cartel Office in Germany.

U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination - The New York Times,"Twenty-eight members of the world champion United States women’s soccer team significantly escalated their long-running fight with the country’s soccer federation over pay equity and working conditions, filing a gender discrimination lawsuit on Friday.","The suit, in United States District Court in Los Angeles, comes only three months before the team will begin defense of its Women’s World Cup title at this summer’s tournament in France. In their filing and a statement released by the team, the 28 players described “institutionalized gender discrimination” that they say has existed for years.","The discrimination, the athletes said, affects not only their paychecks but also where they play and how often, how they train, the medical treatment and coaching they receive, and even how they travel to matches.","The players involved — stars like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd and their teammates — include some of the most accomplished and best-known female athletes in the world, members of a team that has been a leading force in women’s sports for more than a generation.","The players’ continuing battle with U.S. Soccer, which is not only their employer, but also the federation that governs the sport in America, has thrust them to the forefront of a broader fight for equality in women’s sports. In recent years, players, teams and even athletes in other sports — American hockey gold medalists, Canadian soccer pros, W.N.B.A. players — have reached out to the United States players and their union for guidance in their efforts to win similar gains in pay and working conditions.","“I think to be on this team is to understand these issues,” Rapinoe said in a telephone interview. “And I think we’ve always — dating back to forever — been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place.”","Friday’s legal action is the latest flash point in a yearslong fight for pay equity and equal treatment by the national team, which has long chafed — first privately, but increasingly publicly — about the compensation, support and working conditions it receives while representing U.S. Soccer. The women’s players argue that they are required to play more games than the men’s team, that they win more of them, and yet still receive less pay from the federation.",[Sign up for the Sports newsletter.] ,"For decades, U.S. Soccer has been a world leader in its support for women’s soccer; its investment of time and resources has made the United States, which is a three-time world champion and a four-time Olympic gold medalist, the dominant power in the women’s game. But throughout that period, generations of women’s national team players have complained that the federation’s financial support and logistical infrastructure have lagged behind that of the more high-profile men’s team.","Those grievances have never been far from the surface; an earlier generation of top women’s players angry about their pay boycotted a tournament in Australia in January 2000, only months after a World Cup victory had made them the toast of American sports. The dispute between the team and the federation burst into the open more recently as an increasingly emboldened and activist women’s team took on U.S. Soccer and FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, over everything from artificial turf fields to World Cup bonus payments to refereeing standards.","The players’ prominence and willingness to leverage their profiles and enormous social media followings in support of their cause have paid dividends: FIFA doubled the prize money pool for this summer’s Women’s World Cup only after the United States team’s complaints drew attention to how far it lagged behind the pool for the much richer men’s event, and the team has not played a match on artificial turf, a surface many players disdain, since 2017. The United States women flew on a chartered flight — once an unthinkable luxury for the squad — between matches as recently as last week, and U.S. Soccer has eliminated other inequities on topics as disparate as meal money and hotel accommodations.","The respect they have won has spread, too: Spain’s national team rose up to demand the ouster of its coach after the last World Cup, and several prominent members of Brazil’s squad quit their team to protest the ouster of a popular female coach in favor of a man. Players from Argentina and Colombia have gone public about mistreatment and meager pay, and Norway’s players demanded — and won — equal pay with their men’s counterparts. That, too, several United States players said, was part of their motivation to press ahead with their suit only months before they turn their focus to retaining their world championship.","“We very much believe it is our responsibility,” Rapinoe said, “not only for our team and for future U.S. players, but for players around the world — and frankly women all around the world — to feel like they have an ally in standing up for themselves, and fighting for what they believe in, and fighting for what they deserve and for what they feel like they have earned.”",U.S. Soccer did not respond to a request for comment.,"Direct comparisons between the compensation of the men’s and women’s teams can be complicated. Each team has its own collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer, and among the major differences is pay structure: The men receive higher game bonuses when they play for the United States, but are paid only when they make the team, while the women receive guaranteed salaries supplemented by smaller match bonuses.","One of the biggest differences in compensation is the multimillion-dollar bonuses the teams receive for participating in the World Cup, but those bonuses — a pool of $400 million for 32 men’s teams versus $30 million for 24 women’s teams — are determined by FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, not U.S. Soccer.","The bulk of the suit mirrors many of the issues raised in a wage discrimination complaint filed by five United States players with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016. Frustrated by a lack of progress on that complaint after nearly three years of inaction, the players received permission from the federal agency in February to sue instead. (One of the players on the original complaint, the former goalkeeper Hope Solo, filed her own gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer in August.)","The suit offers a new forum but also new hurdles. The players, represented by Jeffrey Kessler, who has been involved in labor fights in nearly every major American sport, will have to prove not only that their team and the men’s squad do the same work, but also overcome questions about the differences in their pay structures and their negotiated collective bargaining agreements. And the C.B.A. has already left them without one bit of leverage: The players cannot strike to press their case at least until it expires at the end of 2021.","But to experts in gender discrimination and Title IX cases, the argument they are making is familiar.","“These are the same kinds of arguments and claims that we still see at every level of education for women and girls, from K through 12 to college,” said Neena Chaudhry, the general counsel of the National Women’s Law Center in Washington. “It’s unfortunately a sad continuation of the way that women and girls in sports are treated in the U.S.”"
Swedish Government Pledges Support for 2026 Olympics - The New York Times,STOCKHOLM — The Swedish government is getting behind the country's bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympics.,"Sports Minister Amanda Lind told broadcaster TV4 that hosting the games ""would be great for Sweden.""","Swedish Olympic Committee chief operating officer Peter Reinebo says taxpayers would not foot the bill for the games, which would be held in Sweden and Latvia. The committee has estimated it will cost 13.1 billion kronor ($1.4 billion) and has said no public funds will be used.","Last week, Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krisjanis Karins pledged support for the 2026 bid. Most events would be held in Sweden — mainly in Are, Falun and in Stockholm — but luge would be in Sigulda, Latvia.",The IOC is scheduled to vote on the 2026 host in June.

Shields Wants to Lift Women's Boxing Into Mainstream - The New York Times,Claressa Shields won Olympic gold in 2012 in London and returned home with only a minimal bump in fame.,"""I'd tell people I won the gold medal and they'd say, 'Yeah, right,'"" she said with a laugh.","So what's an unrecognized champ to do? Shields would just challenge people to Google her if they doubted that she really was one of the top boxer's on the planet. When that dare got old, Shields simply started carrying the gold medal with her and flashed it to her skeptics.","Four years later, when Shields won boxing gold again in Rio , she hid the London medal in her warmup jacket pocket. She pulled it out after winning the championship bout and slipped two golds around her neck atop the medal stand — best in her class, best in the world. Twice.","All that's left for Shields, who overcame a childhood of poverty and abuse, is to reach best of all time.","The 24-year-old Shields (8-0, 2 KOs) is on the fast track toward that claim, headlining one of the more tantalizing bouts in women's boxing history on Saturday night. Shields fights Christina Hammer (24-0, 11 KOs) in a middleweight unification bout live on Showtime at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.","There have been more accomplished female fighters — Laila Ali, Christy Martin, Lucia Rijker top the short list — but no bout has quite matched this one in anticipation or potential historic significance. Shields could continue to lead the evolution of women's boxing the way Ronda Rousey did for MMA and bring the fight game into the mainstream.","Shields is charismatic, making fans and friends out of A-listers such as actress Halle Berry. She's not afraid to give Beyonce a shoutout to attend her fight . She's dominant, not losing a fight since her amateur career, and she's won championships in multiple weight classes as a pro. She takes a stand, putting blue streaks in her hair to raise awareness to the clean water fight that's gone on for years in her hometown of Flint, Michigan.","If her life sounds like something out of a movie, it soon may be: ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" director Barry Jenkins is writing the screenplay for a Shields biopic.","Shields and Hammer are the first female boxers featured on Showtime's All Access YouTube sports channel. The distinction didn't come because of the 28-year-old Hammer, who has racked up wins for a decade in the 160-pound division without fanfare. It's the spark and the success that Shields creates whenever she fights.","""If I was a man, I would probably be one of the most famous boxers out there,"" Shields said. ""There is a gender gap. We all know it. I'm working toward changing that. We work hard, we get less money and less recognition, but the world is changing. We are changing it.""","The undefeated fighters were supposed to meet on Nov. 17, but Hammer postponed it because of a stomach illness.","Shields, whose father spent years in prison during her childhood, spent a day this week visiting kids from the New Jersey Give A Kid A Dream organization and the Girls in Gloves boxing program at the Atlantic City PAL gym. She tried to inspire kids who may have had a rough upbringing like she did and show them that it's possible to achieve goals and ""really see that girls can box.""","""(One of the girls) said I gave them hope and I got a little shaky,"" Shields said. ""I didn't have a role model growing up. So it is a little weird to hear kids say that I am their role model. I am just trying to do a good job.""",Shields said she's practiced her Ali shuffle and is ready to bust it out with a victory. She'll have UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones and boxing star Errol Spence Jr. walk her to the ring on Saturday night.,"""Me and Jon Jones are both the GOATs,"" she said.","And maybe with a win, Shields will start to inch closer in popularity with some of the other greats in women's sports. Rousey has nearly 3.7 million Twitter followers compared to about 35,400 for Shields.","""(Rousey) has one of the biggest followings in women's combat sports. Hell, I've achieved double of what she have and I'm younger and the hate is off the charts ""poorthetic"" but I'm not changing a damn thing! And I won't lose either!"" Shields tweeted .","Shields picked herself off the canvas for the first time after an uppercut by Costa Rican Hanna Gabriels in the first round last June in Detroit. Hammer watched that fight ringside, then created a skirmish when she stepped into the ring to confront Shields.","On Saturday night, they go face-to-face for real — and with perhaps more on the line than just championships.","""This is going to be the biggest women's fight in history,"" Hammer said. ""We're both champions, she has Olympic gold medals and other accolades, so with all of that combined, it's going to be a game changer for our sport.""",___

Conor McGregor’s Retirement and the U.F.C.’s Plan to Survive It - The New York Times,"Conor McGregor has retired and un-retired before, so it is possible he will return to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.","But if McGregor, who loves to talk as much as he loves to fight and loves to win, has indeed left the sport for good after months of career and legal troubles, U.F.C. will be without its most popular and recognizable fighter just as it is trying to expand its footprint in a crowded sports landscape.","“In the short run, they’ll miss the attention that Conor gives them, no doubt,” said Marshall Zelaznik, who spent 10 years as a U.F.C. executive before leaving in 2016. “For the longevity of a promotion, you need these kinds of stars.”",[Read: McGregor is under investigation in Ireland after an accusation of sexual assault.],"U.F.C. has churned out other athletes with crossover appeal. Jon Jones, the first mixed martial artist with a Nike signature shoe, recently returned from a 15-month doping suspension. Ronda Rousey, who has become a professional wrestler, regularly drew huge pay-per-view audiences as recently as 2016.","Now the sport is confronting a fallow period, with unfortunate timing. ESPN, the new U.F.C. broadcast partner, has taken over the sport’s pay-per-view distribution and will air the main events exclusively on its streaming network, ESPN+.","“It’s at a crossroads,” David Carter, the director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California, said of U.F.C.","The company’s alignment with ESPN ushers a once renegade sport deeper into the mainstream. On top of a reported five-year, $1.5 billion deal struck last May that wrested the complete media rights package from Fox, ESPN paid an undisclosed fee to extend that deal through 2025 and become the only purveyor of pay-per-view fights in the United States. They will be shown exclusively on ESPN+, which costs $4.99 monthly. Main cards will cost an extra $59.99.","ESPN has not released any viewership data from ESPN+ beyond acknowledging in its quarterly earnings call in February that two million subscribers had signed up and that it attracted 568,000 new subscribers in January, when the initial deal with U.F.C. kicked in. It is unknown, for instance, whether people signed up for ESPN+ and then left — and if so, how many.","Even before McGregor retired on Tuesday, Carter said he believed this was a critical time for U.F.C., which is owned by Endeavor, a sports, entertainment and fashion content marketing company.","“Our metrics show that our fan base has significantly scaled,” said Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, “and that M.M.A. viewers are buying the fights as much for the slate of fights as they are any one individual fighter.”","According to Nielsen data, through five live telecasts on ESPN’s main channels, U.F.C. is averaging 1,462,000 viewers, or more than twice as many as its fights averaged (707,000) on FS1 last year.","Still, U.F.C. appears to have reached a critical juncture in the same manner as other leagues, like the N.B.A., that struggled with sustainable star power during transition seasons.","The challenge for U.F.C., Carter said, is to develop the new fighters to supplant the old guard when, to some extent, fans will have to pay for an ESPN+ subscription to get to know them.","And lately casual sports fans have been hearing about U.F.C. largely in connection with fight cancellations or suspensions. Or in McGregor’s case, a suspension for his role in a brawl after he lost a fight in Las Vegas and criminal charges after he was caught on video last spring outside Barclays Center throwing a metal dolly into the window of a bus carrying U.F.C. athletes and employees. He pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn court to one count of disorderly conduct.","“That’s not limited to U.F.C. at all,” Carter said. “But at some point, I think at some point casual fans get fatigued by the circus element of it.”","By selling the rights to ESPN, U.F.C. no longer has to worry about some of the uncontrollable elements that affect pay-per-view purchases — injuries, suspensions, retirements. The venture is somewhat risky for ESPN as it tries to determine whether a substantial audience will quickly adapt to a new network and subscribe to ESPN+, but the deal represents a long-term investment.","ESPN did not make anyone available for comment, but a partnership with the network improves U.F.C.’s chances of becoming a topic of conversation on ESPN programs like SportsCenter and First Take.","“I do think they need to do a better job of building stars, making people stand out,” Chuck Liddell, one of the early U.F.C. stars, said in a telephone interview. “There’s so many fights now. Back in the day, there used to be six U.F.C. events. Now there’s what, 40?”","Under ESPN’s deal, there will be 42 nights of live events, including 12 on pay-per-view, which will increase the need for appealing fights. Zelaznik joined U.F.C. in 2006, in the middle of Liddell’s career. He said he could not recall feeling anxious about unearthing new talent, or there being a lull.","“The biggest difference right now is that when I came on, U.F.C. was the only game in town — it was the entire cola category,” said Zelaznik, who oversaw U.F.C.’s pay-per-view and digital business and is now the chief executive officer at Glory Sports International. “Now U.F.C. is clearly the Coke and Pepsi, and then there’s a lot of RC Cola and Shasta. The uniqueness has sort of worn off. The novelty isn’t what it was. People are familiar with it, so how do you make people care?”","That question is central to the growth of U.F.C., which wants to protect itself for the future while providing a return on ESPN’s investment. Michael Berman, executive vice president of programming and general counsel for In Demand, which until recently distributed U.F.C. fights to cable systems, said that interest had declined over the past few years, except for a few megaevents.","Across its 25 cards in 2017 and 2018, U.F.C. attracted 400,000 pay-per-view purchases — a threshold for what Berman considers substantial — only four times. U.F.C. events topped a million once, when Khabib Nurmagomedov defeated McGregor in October, according to MMAPayout.com, a website that tracks the business of mixed martial arts. In its 26 cards from 2015 to 2016, when Rousey and McGregor were fighting regularly, 13 pay-per-view bouts surpassed 400,000 purchases, and seven exceeded a million.","“There’s so much content available that it becomes very difficult to differentiate between a lower-level pay-per-view and a fight that had been appearing on Fox or FS1,” Berman said. “If you’ve got three weeks of U.F.C. programming and two are available for free and one is $65, the one that’s $65 really has to stand out to pay that money. Without the big stars, it’s difficult to convince people to spend.”","That’s especially true, Berman added, now that people are spending on other streaming services like Hulu, Netflix or DAZN and will have to determine whether they want to pay for another.","“ESPN has that brand name and can build off that, but they’re not the only game in town,” Carter said.","The best way, Zelaznik said, to distinguish U.F.C. — to make people care — is to identify fighters as personalities.","Liddell knocked out people. Georges St-Pierre kept fans interested by defending his title nine consecutive times. Michael Bisping won a season of the reality television series “The Ultimate Fighter” — then won the middleweight title. If you don’t have a great fighter, Zelaznik said, you can’t make him a star.","“That’s when you need the Conors of the world — the Brock Lesnars, even the Jon Joneses,” Zelaznik said. “Otherwise you’re just fishing in the same pond, repurposing all of your fans. You’ve got to grow in this space or you die.”"

"C.W.H.L. Folds, Leaving North America With One Women’s Hockey League - The New York Times","In a sudden blow to women’s professional sports in North America, the Canadian Women’s Hockey League announced on Sunday that it would discontinue operations on May 1.","The C.W.H.L., founded in 2007, operated as a centrally funded, nonprofit enterprise. It included some of the sport’s biggest stars, like Hilary Knight and Marie-Philip Poulin.","Laurel Walzak, chairwoman of the league’s board of directors, said that the C.W.H.L.’s management had realized in the past few weeks that funding would not be available to continue next season.","“We realized this model is no longer viable in the economics and the future of the C.W.H.L.,” Walzak said. “We voted on this Friday night.”","The C.W.H.L. had six teams spread across Canada, Massachusetts and China. Last weekend, it held its championship game, which was broadcast live in Canada and the United States. The C.W.H.L.’s closing leaves the National Women’s Hockey League, founded in 2015, as the only pro hockey option for women in North America.","In recent years, players have pushed for a single league. The N.W.H.L., which has five teams in the United States, will look into becoming a new home for some of the almost 150 C.W.H.L. players who will soon be without a team.","“We will pursue any and all opportunities to ensure the best players in Canada have a place to play,” said Dani Rylan, the founder and commissioner of the N.W.H.L. “Those conversations have started already and have quickly become a priority.”","Sunday’s announcement shocked C.W.H.L. players, many of whom are Olympians for the United States and Canada and are in Finland preparing for the world championships. Poulin and other players tweeted a statement saying that they had been informed of the closing on Sunday morning and that it would be “hard to remain optimistic” that they would find a new home.","In June 2017, the C.W.H.L. announced its expansion to China with the addition of two teams. The move was intended to present a wealth of sponsorship and other business opportunities. Beijing is preparing to host the 2022 Olympics, and the N.H.L. has made increasing its footprint in Asia a priority.","Three months later, the C.W.H.L. began paying players for the first time. Under a salary cap of 100,000 Canadian dollars, player stipends ranged from $2,000 to $10,000. That figure was the same this season, but there were signs that the growth of the league was not as bountiful as had been expected, including the Chinese clubs’ merging into one franchise this season.","Walzak and Jayna Hefford, who took over as interim commissioner when Brenda Andress left the organization last summer, said that China was a great opportunity for the league and that the clubs in Asia provided significant funding but that the expenses of running five North American teams, compounded with the exhaustive efforts to build sponsorships, ticket and merchandise sales in the United States and Canada, were straining the C.W.H.L. model.","“The infrastructure wasn’t there to make it work,” said Brant Feldman, an agent who has represented several Olympic and pro women’s hockey players. “You need a full-time staff to go out and market the sport, sell tickets, do sponsorships, understand integrated marketing communications and operate the professional sport. Neither league has that.”",Walzak said that the board was in the process of sorting out its finances from this season but that it expected that all payments owed would be made soon.,"The C.W.H.L. had relationships with several N.H.L. teams and the N.H.L. players’ association, but the N.H.L. has always appeared hesitant to embrace professional women’s hockey, choosing not to get in between the two North American leagues. Last November, W. Graeme Roustan, a noted investor in hockey ventures who said he was the largest investor in the league, announced that he was withdrawing his funding.","In a statement on Sunday, an N.H.L. spokesman indicated that the news would not result in any changes from the league’s perspective. The statement said: “The N.H.L.’s position has been consistent for some time and remains unchanged with this news: we would consider starting a women’s league if there were no alternatives for women to play professionally in North America.”","The N.H.L.P.A. also issued a statement, which said: “While this news is certainly disappointing — for the fans as well as the players — we hope that appropriate opportunities for these players will be available soon. We wish the players all the best.”","Hefford said other stakeholders had expressed interest in continuing to help the sport. After the 2018 Olympics, American and Canadian players discussed the possibility of working together to reach the goal of a single league, but nothing materialized.","Digit Murphy, a former coach in the C.W.H.L., said that women’s sports should not have to be dependent on men’s pro sports for resources and that the current pool of players was strong enough to produce a successful model."
U.S.A. Basketball Is Said to Be Eyeing Zion Williamson for the World Cup - The New York Times,"U.S.A. Basketball plans to gauge the interest of the Duke University sensation Zion Williamson in joining the Americans’ 12-man squad for the FIBA World Cup in China this summer, according to a person familiar with U.S.A. Basketball’s intentions.","No discussions have taken place with Williamson, whose freshman season at Duke ended Sunday with a 68-67 quarterfinal loss against Michigan State in the N.C.A.A. tournament.","Formal talks with Williams, the presumptive No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick, would most likely not take place until Williams had officially declared his intention to turn professional and chosen an agent licensed by the N.B.A. to represent him, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly.","But the precedent for such an invitation was set by the current U.S.A. Basketball hierarchy in 2012, when Anthony Davis — fresh off being drafted No. 1 overall out of Kentucky by the New Orleans Pelicans — earned a roster spot with Team USA at the London Olympics under Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski.","The 2019 World Cup, which runs Aug. 31 to Sept. 15 in China, will be the first major competition for the United States since Krzyzewski was succeeded as coach by Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. Williamson is widely regarded as the rare sort of talent, like Davis before him, who would not be out of place with the N.B.A. All-Stars expected to fill out Popovich’s roster — no matter who is coaching.","The Athletic reported Monday that the Lakers’ LeBron James, a three-time Olympian, would not make himself available for the World Cup team this summer but that he had not ruled out playing for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.",There was some hope in international basketball circles that James would consider playing in the World Cup since the Lakers had missed the playoffs and James would sit out the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since 2004-05.,"Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of U.S.A. Basketball, declined to discuss James or Williamson specifically when he was reached on Monday, saying only that roster invitations “will be addressed at the appropriate time.”"
Opinion | Forget the All-Star Game. Start Watching Italian Basketball. - The New York Times,"MILAN — As the National Basketball Association plods its way to the 68th annual All-Star Game in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday, American hoops fans should take note of how the Italians generate hardwood drama in February.","Since Thursday, the eight best teams in Italy’s Lega Basket Serie A from the first half of the season have been competing for the Coppa Italia, a no-holds-barred, single elimination tournament whose outcome actually matters to fans, players, team owners and corporate sponsors. And while a champion will be crowned at the end of the playoffs later this spring, bragging rights for holding the Coppa’s trophy aloft on Sunday provides a midseason shot of adrenaline.","The N.B.A.’s 82-game regular season, which began in October and will end in April, is a slog. Anyone who has watched a Wednesday night non-marquee matchup in November can attest to that. The action rarely begins before the fourth quarter; coaches rest their superstars.","The first half of the Italian season, by contrast, is an exciting sprint from the opening tipoff. The 16-team league has a 30-game regular season in which each club plays each other twice — once at each other’s home court. If you play in Venice in week one, Venice’s team comes to your arena in week 16. And there’s drama: Turin, seeded fifth in last year’s Coppa, won the trophy, even though they placed 11th at the end of the season.","There’s an intensity to the Italian regular season that too often is missing from the N.B.A.’s long fall and winter games. Not only are there fewer games, but also they are shorter and quicker (10- as opposed to 12-minute quarters and with fewer play stoppages mandated by television). And even if the quality of play in Italy is inferior, the interest in the February Coppa Italia far outstrips whether Team LeBron will prevail over Team Giannis at the N.B.A.’s All-Star Game.","“Whether it is game six or 26, you are always playing for something,” said Travis Diener, an American who also holds Italian citizenship and plays on this year’s fourth-seeded team from Cremona. “Then you get the Coppa and anything can happen.” Diener, who spent several years in the N.B.A., won the M.V.P. award of the Coppa Italia when he was playing for Sassari in Sardinia in 2014.","The Coppa allows teams from smaller markets (and smaller budgets) like Sassari and Cremona (more famous for Stradivarius violins than hoops) to pull off March Madness-like upsets against more glamorous squads like Milan, which is sponsored by Giorgio Armani and takes full advantage of the lack of a league salary cap.","In last year’s Coppa, Milan was one of three top seeds that lost in the first round, much to the delight of fans from smaller-market teams like Cantù, which plays in the Milanese suburb of Desio. As one team official told me, it doesn’t hurt that coaches have built-in salary incentives if their team does well at the midseason tournament — and sponsors, of course, love the positive brand attention of a winning squad.","The quarterfinal round began on Thursday and Friday, featuring a doubleheader each day: Milan-Bologna and Cremona-Varese on day one, and Venice-Sassari and Avellino-Brindisi on day two. American fans should try to imagine a similar midseason weekend tournament: What if the Bucks, Warriors, Raptors, Nuggets, Celtics, Pacers, Thunder and 76ers were playing in Charlotte this weekend for bragging rights to an American Basketball Cup? It would be a fresh take on a tired All-Star Game whose television ratings have declined by more than 50 percent since the Michael Jordan-dominated 1990s.","The Italian basketball league used to have its own all-star game, but there wasn’t enough sustained interest from players or fans, so it ended in 2016. A dunk contest was similarly discontinued. Giorgio Gandolfi, a former basketball journalist who now runs his own international sports agency and who has been to 13 N.B.A. All-Star Games, said that winning the Coppa Italia is second in prestige only to winning the league championship at the end of the season. He doesn’t miss Italy’s all-star games. “They were just kind of boring,” he said.","While there is too much money to be made for the N.B.A. — and team owners — to consider shortening the season from the grueling 82-game march to the playoffs, the idea of borrowing from the Italians to make each tipoff count more should be enticing.","Take the case of the New York Knicks, who currently hold the worst record in the N.B.A. There is nothing much left for the Knicks to play for or their fans to watch this season.","By contrast, Italian basketball teams near the bottom of the league run the risk of relegation to the second division, which is a bad result for everyone. That’s why the fight near the end of the season can be just as fierce at the bottom as it is as the top.","If the Knicks had to worry about being consigned to the minor leagues, the folks at Madison Square Garden might think differently about how to handle the final months of the season. If the Knicks were demoted to play against the Maine Red Claws, New York fans would probably have some choice words and creative hand gestures for their team’s poor management. Italian basketball fans would have some advice on how to do that better, too."
"Four Forgettable Years Later, Playoff Basketball Returns to New York - The New York Times","As the crowd filed out of the Barclays Center in May 2015, there was reason for hope.

Looking for Arizona Basketball? It Graduated to the N.B.A. - The New York Times,"OAKLAND, Calif. — The Golden State Warriors run a practice drill that Coach Steve Kerr did not intend as a tribute, even if he named it after someone who taught him a great deal. He calls it the “Lute Olson drill,” and it is a blur of activity: a 3-on-2 exercise that Kerr uses to get his players up and down the court.","“It’s a good way to get a little running and rhythm and shooting,” he said.","The Warriors, who are pretty good at those things, have elevated basketball into modern art in recent seasons. But Kerr, as he helps define basketball’s present, cannot help but dip into his past. He learned that drill in 1983, when he was a freshman guard at the University of Arizona playing for Olson, who was in the early stages of building a college powerhouse. Kerr, ever the student, was already absorbing as much as he could.","Olson, 84, retired as the men’s basketball coach at Arizona in 2008, but his influence resonates. Not so much, oddly enough, at the college level, where, of late, Arizona has had its well-publicized struggles along with the rest of the Pac-12 Conference. Instead, Olson’s impact exists largely in the N.B.A. — and with the Warriors, in particular.","Bruce Fraser, one of Kerr’s longtime assistants, played for Olson in the 1980s before working under him as a graduate assistant. And Andre Iguodala, the veteran Warriors forward, played at Arizona from 2002 to 2004, when he sought to emulate an older teammate named Luke Walton.","“All the fundamentals,” Iguodala said. “Things like footwork, body positioning and just being a smart player.”","Walton, who now has the thankless task of coaching the Los Angeles Lakers, is still considered a member of the Warriors’ extended family after serving as one of Kerr’s assistants for two seasons. Before Walton joined the Warriors in 2014, Kerr did not know him well. But Olson recommended him, and that was more than enough.","“If you came out of Arizona during that era, you knew how to play the game,” Fraser said. “And that was mostly because of Lute.”","Olson, who has had health issues in recent years, emphasized basketball basics. Each practice began with a series of chest passes. Players worked on their weak hands. The Warriors, who warm up by launching half-court heaves, are slightly less regimented.","“If Coach Olson walked in and saw some of this, he’d be shaking his head,” Fraser said. “He’d think we’re so loose.”","The Warriors are still mindful of the essentials, though, especially at training camp, where they dribble around traffic cones and throw passes at pitch-back nets configured with targets. If they channel the Harlem Globetrotters, their flamboyance is rooted in bedrock principles.","“And I think you could tie a lot of that back to Coach Olson and Arizona,” Fraser said.","Kerr played for several legendary N.B.A. coaches — Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Lenny Wilkens, Cotton Fitzsimmons — and he took pieces from each as he developed his own style. Jerry Marvin, his former coach at Palisades High School in Los Angeles, made a big impression, too. But these were coaches with unique approaches.","“I think the common thread is their force of personality,” Kerr said. “They all saw the game a little differently and ran different stuff, basing a lot of it on their personnel. But it’s not what made them great coaches. It was having great talent, and then developing a great culture and system so that their talent could flourish.”","Olson, for example, adapted to the strengths of his roster. He became more guard-oriented over the years, especially after he recruited high-profile players like Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves and Gilbert Arenas. (Kerr noted how he had been one of the “slow guys in the backcourt” when Olson was just starting out at Arizona.)","But Olson was not necessarily trying to outwit anyone by being especially innovative. Basketball, Kerr said, is not like football, where a mastermind like Bill Belichick can lean on his tactical genius to mold the New England Patriots into the most dominant N.F.L. team of his era.","“Football is so strategic,” Kerr said. “But in basketball, there aren’t many guys I can think of historically who are the best coaches on earth who were just offensive wizards or defensive wizards. It was more about the culture they built and the way their teams played together — not a style or a system.”","It has become a hackneyed concept in sports, as if teams can just crack the code on demand, but Olson was all about culture, his former players say. Jason Terry, a retired N.B.A. guard who played at Arizona from 1995 to 1999, recalled his recruitment. He was not a shy young man, but Olson, at that point firmly established as one of the game’s top coaches, had the sort of gravitas that intimidated him.","On the second day of Terry’s official visit to Arizona, Olson and his wife, Bobbi, had him over for pancakes.","“These unbelievable pancakes,” Terry, an analyst for Turner Sports, said in a telephone interview. “That was a big part of the recruitment. But I also remember that he kind of came over and put his big paw on my shoulder, and I jumped. He was like, ‘Nothing to be scared of young fella. It’s great to have you in my home.’ And from that point on, you were just at ease.”","Olson, Terry said, was the first coach he had who never used profanity. Olson would glare. His face would go red. And those big paws would shake.","“But he would never yell,” Terry said. “He would just say your name over and over and over.”","Above all, Olson imbued his players with the sense that they were a part of something larger than themselves. Before the national championship game in 1997, two prominent alumni — Kerr and Sean Elliott, both of whom had graduated to the N.B.A. — boarded the team bus. Olson had invited them to address his players, and their message was simple: Do it for all of us who have come before you but could never quite get the job done.",Terry saw that Olson had tears in his eyes. Arizona went on to win its first national title by defeating Kentucky in overtime.,"“We knew that we couldn’t let him down,” Terry said.","With the Warriors, Kerr definitely swears on occasion. (Ask Draymond Green.) And the N.B.A. is not college basketball. But Kerr still tries to foster an atmosphere that is more about the collective whole than about its supremely talented parts. Kerr loathes isolation sets. He celebrates ball movement. And he stages team dinners on road trips, where family members are welcome.","As for the Pac-12, these are rough days. Arizona, under Coach Sean Miller, has been entwined in a corruption scandal, and the conference could send just one team to the N.C.A.A. tournament. Iguodala described the Pac-12 as garbage (he used a more colorful word), though he expressed hope moving forward. Kerr was more diplomatic.","“It’s been a dry spell,” he said. “And I really don’t know the answer.”","In fact, the Pac-12 has not won a national championship since Kerr boarded the Arizona team bus back in 1997 and delivered his pregame pep talk. But in his own way, as the Warriors chase another title, he is still carrying the mantle for the conference and his old coach."
Magic Johnson Always Set His Sights Beyond Basketball - The New York Times,"It is one of the oldest warnings in sports: Great athletes, they say, don’t often become great coaches.","In the case of Magic Johnson, the legendary former Los Angeles Lakers point guard, that maxim must be amended. For Johnson, neither the front office nor the bench proved to be a winning or even comfortable habitat like the hardwood he used as a launching pad to basketball immortality.","Johnson’s forgettable coaching career with the Lakers lasted just 16 games at the close of the 1993-94 season before he unhappily vowed never to return to that occupation. Then this week, Johnson’s two-year reign as the Lakers’ president of basketball operations ended even more ignominiously.","He abruptly announced his resignation before the team’s final game of an enormously disappointing season, then revealed that he had told the news media of the decision before he had informed his boss, Jeanie Buss, in order to deny Buss an opportunity to talk him out of it.","Johnson, of course, has stunned the world before, with his announcement and early retirement in 1991 because he was found to be H.I.V. positive, followed by his brief return to basketball in 1996. He spent the ensuing two decades constructing a business and entertainment empire replete with a highly successful chain of movie theaters and an ownership stake in the storied Los Angeles Dodgers. But Johnson always insisted that he was, first and foremost, a Laker.","Handling his exit in such a haphazard manner has earned Johnson untold amounts of criticism in the days since, given how much the Lakers mean to Southern Californians and how unexpected this news was. Yet he seems prepared to take the hits in exchange for the opportunity to return to his more customary post-playing life “on the other side,” as he described it — forever a Laker but officially unattached to any team.","“I like to be free,” Johnson said.","But his freedom comes at a steep cost — to Johnson, to the Lakers, to a Hollywood belief in, well, magic.","It turns out Magic Johnson, who piloted some of the greatest teams in N.B.A. history, will not be the savior who helps the Lakers escape their longest run of futility.","After last summer’s blockbuster signing of LeBron James, Johnson proclaimed the Lakers to be “back” — with the promise of a return to full “back back” status this summer once they acquired at least one superstar sidekick to James. Johnson has instead fled just when the most crucial work was about to commence, with no clear path to bringing that second star to a flailing franchise that last reached the playoffs in 2013 and last won a championship in 2010.","When he convened an impromptu news conference Tuesday night, rather than reveal his updated plan to restore the Lakers to title contention and placate a frustrated fan base, Johnson did just the opposite. Describing himself as “happier when I wasn’t the president,” he explained that the conditions and pressures attached to building a championship team around James meant that the real Magic “couldn’t come out.”","In a series of rambling interviews with a number of news outlets while the Lakers were in the process of losing their regular-season finale to the Portland Trail Blazers, Johnson spoke of how he had longed to send a congratulatory tweet to Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook or to tutor Ben Simmons, the rising Philadelphia 76ers star, without inciting a storm of tampering allegations.","“I knew if I stayed in the role,” he said, “I’m giving up a lot of me.”","Such disclosures, of course, only served to validate much of the skepticism that greeted Buss’s decision to install Johnson as the new face of the Lakers’ basketball operations in February 2017.","Rival front-office executives questioned Johnson’s lack of experience in the modern game and his willingness to embrace the all-encompassing nature of the job from the moment he was named to replace the much-maligned Jim Buss (Jeanie’s brother) and Mitch Kupchak, the longtime Lakers executive. Those questions only rose in volume when Buss named as Magic’s sidekick another front-office neophyte, Rob Pelinka, Kobe Bryant’s polarizing former agent.","There were red flags from the start. In taking on his first active role with an N.B.A. team since his second retirement as a player in 1996, Johnson admitted that he had much to learn about navigating the ins and outs of the N.B.A.’s complex salary cap and the rhythms of a job that had evolved so much in his time away.","“The main part for me is really learning the other part that I didn’t know, and that is to understand the C.B.A., the salary cap, where we are in terms of the salary cap and who’s a free-agent-to-be,” Johnson told USA Today of the challenges he faced in building a roster and understanding the collective bargaining agreement.","Part of the issue might have been that Johnson could never just be a basketball executive. He is a mogul and a cultural force. While other N.B.A. teams primarily lean on decision makers focusing solely on basketball, Johnson seemed to always have his eye on something bigger than the game itself — reaching with his business tentacles to as many corners as possible.","Johnson acquired a 4.5 percent share of the Lakers in 1994 before selling his stake in 2010. He even once hosted a syndicated late-night talk show, 1998’s “The Magic Hour.” And he was never just about one game either, acquiring a minority stake in the Dodgers in 2012 and one in the Los Angeles Football Club of Major League Soccer in 2014.","Business had clearly been on Johnson’s mind when he took the Lakers’ front-office job in 2017. He told “CBS This Morning” in an interview at the time that he had turned down other offers to run a franchise, including the embattled Knicks, but that he felt it was the right time to rejoin the Lakers.","“At this point in my life, you know, I think that I can do it right now because my businesses are running smooth,” Johnson said. “I can turn them over to my executive team that I have.” In that same interview, he said, “I always wanted to be the male Oprah.”","Johnson was one of the first athletes to build an empire for himself outside professional sports. He went from whipping behind-the-back passes and being the engine that made the 1980s Showtime Lakers rev to investing in more than 100 Starbucks and Burger King locations, among many other business investments, all while flashing his famed charismatic grin. According to a Basketball Reference estimate, Johnson made about $23 million from N.B.A. salary alone, not including endorsements. Now his net worth is in the hundreds of millions.","The business of reviving the Lakers, however, proved beyond him. Buss, as a result, is already facing pressure to rebound from her nostalgic faith in Johnson to pursue a more accomplished executive this time — such as Golden State’s Bob Myers or San Antonio’s R. C. Buford — to plot the team’s recovery from a season soaked in drama and dysfunction.","Bizarre as the timing seemed, Johnson insisted to reporters that there were no hidden reasons for leaving other than the desire, as he put it to ESPN’s Rachel Nichols, to stop “letting myself down by not being Magic Johnson.”","What’s clear is that walking away when he did spared him from firing Coach Luke Walton — something Walton and his assistant coaches, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly, had been bracing for this week. Walton’s culpability for the Lakers’ 37-45 record is a matter of debate, given all of this season’s injuries, but Johnson’s desire to make a change had been widely anticipated in league circles for weeks, if not months. Buss’s well-chronicled fondness for Walton is thought to be the only thing that had kept him in place throughout Johnson’s reign.","“I would have to affect someone’s livelihood and their life,” Johnson told reporters Tuesday night, seemingly confirming that he was poised to fire Walton. “And I thought about that. That’s not fun for me. That’s not who I am.”","There had never been a player like Johnson before he was drafted out of Michigan State as the first pick in the 1979 N.B.A. draft. His court vision, quickness, length and versatility made him a dominant presence and led to his winning three Most Valuable Player Awards and five N.B.A. championships. He became perhaps the defining face of what it means to be a Laker — no easy feat given the deep well of great players who have worn their familiar purple-and-gold jersey.","But the fact that Buss has yet to address the news media, beyond a brief statement insisting that the organization still believed “there is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” speaks to the team’s level of shock that he would step down without warning.","At a speaking engagement at Chapman University on April 3, Buss acknowledged that the Lakers “haven’t lived up to the brand my father created,” referring to one of the most successful owners in the history of American team sports: Jerry Buss. The signing of James in free agency last summer — for which Johnson is sometimes subjected to claims that his “closer” role was overstated — could not prevent the Lakers from extending their playoff drought to a franchise-worst sixth consecutive season. That figure matches the Knicks for the league’s third-longest active drought behind Sacramento (13 seasons) and Phoenix (nine).","Now, the onus falls squarely on Buss to find a successor to repair a roster in need of overhaul.","To Johnson’s relief, such issues are no longer his concern. He returns now to a world he may have felt increasingly more comfortable with anyway in recent years: the one outside basketball. As he told The Los Angeles Times in 2008, Johnson hoped to go down in history as a better businessman than an athlete.","“That’s my dream,” Johnson said. “And I’m going after it each and every day.”"

Avenatti’s Client: The Basketball Club Coach Caught Up in a Federal Case. - The New York Times,LOS ANGELES — The criminal case involving one of President Trump’s leading adversaries and the world’s biggest shoe company has also ensnared an unlikely figure from the youth basketball world.,"The coach, Gary Franklin Sr., started his club from scratch in Los Angeles and ran a program known for its rectitude, according to Sonny Vaccaro, the former Nike and Adidas executive who essentially forged the relationship between the shoe industry and the summer youth basketball circuit. What began as a team for Franklin to coach his then 10-year-old son became a powerhouse club that attracted future N.B.A. stars and major college recruits, and one that steered clear of any scandals.","“He was one of the guys who built it up through his own resources, and his program had a reputation as one of the ‘good guys,’” Vaccaro said of Franklin in an interview this week.","Franklin’s club, California Supreme, and others like it are major participants in a system involving youth basketball, shoe companies and colleges that supplies the professional game with a deep reservoir of talent. And Michael Avenatti knew it.","Now Franklin has become a central figure in the case against Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her lawsuit against President Trump. Whether Franklin, who has not been charged, is an accomplice, a co-conspirator or simply collateral damage is not yet clear, but prosecutors’ revelations about his involvement have stunned those who have known him for years.","The question in the club basketball world is, could Franklin have morphed from a stickler who played by the rules into the latest symbol of an amateur basketball world that has spun out of control?","“Cal Supreme was always the best team for doing things by the book, because there were a lot of other teams that didn’t do it by the book,” said Andy Brown, a former forward for Cal Supreme who went on to play at Stanford. “And Cal Supreme did it by the book.”","California Supreme reached its zenith at the 2016 Peach Jam, a summertime showcase for the best travel basketball teams and players in the country. In the final event of the Nike-sponsored league, Deandre Ayton, a towering Bahamian who was about to turn 18, helped the team reel off a huge winning streak before Cal Supreme fell to the eventual champions.","For Franklin, a soft-spoken coach from Los Angeles, the run was a triumph. His Nike-sponsored team was one of the best in the country in what is now known as grass-roots basketball.","Three years later, Franklin, 51, is in a different spotlight, with federal prosecutors accusing Avenatti of extortion for threatening Nike with the release of information that Avenatti had pledged would damage the company’s stock-market value to the tune of a few billion dollars. Specifically, Avenatti had told Nike lawyers this month that a coach in Nike’s grass-roots basketball league had approached him with information that company employees had paid the families of three players, prosecutors said. Avenatti, prosecutors said, demanded that Nike pay millions to make the whole thing go away.","Paying players and their families would violate N.C.A.A. rules, rendering the players ineligible for college play. Also, if the money was paid in exchange for players to commit to colleges Nike sponsors, it would resemble the behavior that recently led to federal fraud convictions for two former Adidas employees.","Two people familiar with the investigation confirmed that the unidentified coach in the complaint is Franklin. Nike had recently declined to renew its sponsorship deal with Cal Supreme, which was worth more than $70,000 annually. Franklin could not be reached for comment.","Grass-roots basketball is often erroneously called A.A.U. basketball, even in prosecutors’ court filings. That is a misnomer because the elite leagues are not sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union. Rather, they are supported by sneaker companies that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to organize tournaments from April through July. The teenage players who participate are outfitted, from head to toe, in apparel made by and bearing the logo of the league’s sponsor.","Sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas also pay thousands of dollars each year to sponsor the teams themselves as a sort of long-term investment strategy: They hope to build brand loyalty among young players who could eventually become stars. Get players into your gear early, the thinking goes, and you may be more likely to land them as spokesmen when they turn pro and have even more influence over the world’s fans — and their wallets.","“Sneaker companies want to make money,” said Dr. Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California who was the executive producer of a 2016 documentary, “At All Costs: Life Inside A.A.U. Basketball.” “That’s their objective. And if you have a kid who’s good enough to go on to the N.B.A., and he chooses to continue wearing these shoes, you’ve made a long-term investment that could pay off for years.”","At the same time, the grass-roots basketball landscape has shifted in recent years as N.B.A. players like Bradley Beal, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony have increasingly become involved in forming their own teams. These are players who already have partnerships with shoe companies and can help subsidize costs on their own. Last year, Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who has an endorsement deal with Nike’s Jordan brand, organized a Los Angeles-based team that advanced to the playoffs at the Peach Jam.",Franklin was far from the N.B.A. when he started his team.,"A flattering portrait of Franklin is included in “Play Their Hearts Out,” a 2010 book by George Dohrmann that details youth basketball culture in Southern California. Franklin, according to the book, played basketball and football at Los Angeles Valley College. Later, he doted on his son, Gary Jr., creating a club team he initially called the Runnin’ Rebels. He preached fundamentals during their practices at Manual Arts High School and spoke openly about his faith in God. Gary Franklin Jr. went on to play college basketball at Baylor.","Cal Supreme did not have lavish resources. When Brown, the Stanford player, was with the team, it practiced at various Los Angeles-area high schools. Parents subsidized costs. And players paid for their own meals at tournaments.",Yet neither Brown nor his teammates were naïve about the world they inhabited.,"“Everybody who played knew what was going on,” Brown said. “We all knew people who were getting paid, we all knew people who were getting free stuff — we all knew it. Now, it’s all coming out. So it’s shocking, but it’s not shocking, because we all knew it was happening.”","For years, the sponsorship deals have been heavily dependent on grass-roots coaches’ attracting the best players to their programs. Cal Supreme appeared to have enough talent over the years to keep Nike interested, producing players who ultimately landed at major college programs like Southern California, Oregon and Arizona, along with several who went to the N.B.A.","Big names circled in Cal Supreme’s orbit. Miles Simon, a guard who had won an N.C.A.A. championship while playing at Arizona, was one of the program’s coaches from 2011 to 2014. (Simon, who now works as an assistant for the Lakers, declined to comment through a Lakers spokeswoman.) Shareef O’Neal, a top-tier recruit and the son of Shaquille O’Neal, played for Cal Supreme before going to U.C.L.A. More recently, Percy Miller, the businessman and rapper known as Master P, was listed on Cal Supreme’s website as a team partner.","Ayton, who spent a season at Arizona before the Phoenix Suns made him the top overall pick in the 2018 N.B.A. draft, was Cal Supreme’s highest-profile player. But in a twist, after years of wearing Nikes, Ayton signed a lucrative deal to wear Pumas when he went to the N.B.A. For Nike, it was an investment that did not pay off.",It remains unclear whether Ayton’s deal played any role in Nike’s decision not to extend its sponsorship deal with Cal Supreme.,"Cassius Stanley, a top-30 recruit and a senior at Sierra Canyon High School outside Los Angeles, played for Cal Supreme in 2016 and for Westbrook’s team in 2018. His father, Jerome Stanley, who works as a lawyer, said that as far as he knew, Nike had never provided Cal Supreme players or their family members with benefits that would violate N.C.A.A. rules.","“It is very sad that Coach Gary has gotten himself tangled up in this mess,” Stanley said. “I feel bad for him and his family, and I pray that he and his lawyers can help him move on and not be damaged or used any more than he has been the past few days.”"

North Carolina Women’s Basketball Coach Faces Complaints of Racially Insensitive Comments - The New York Times,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The families of several University of North Carolina women’s basketball players complained last week of racially insensitive remarks by Sylvia Hatchell, the program’s Hall of Fame coach, who was subsequently put on leave, according to two people with direct knowledge of the allegations.","Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, said in an interview Thursday that his client was aware of the accusations that were described in detail by one of the people with direct knowledge. He said his client’s words had been misquoted or misconstrued.","The families detailed their concerns in a meeting that some U.N.C. officials attended in Chapel Hill while the athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, joined by video conference from another location, according to the person who described the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.","The meeting included accusations that Hatchell had warned that a loss to Louisville could lead to “nooses,” according to the person, and that the coach had once urged players to do a “tomahawk chop” war cry, a request the women resisted.","Within days of the meeting, the university, which has been in the midst of a reckoning over racism and Confederate history, announced that Hatchell and her three assistants would be put on paid administrative leave while an outside law firm conducted a review to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.”","The announcement stunned North Carolina and appeared abrupt, but in the discussion with university officials on March 28, players’ relatives said Hatchell’s conduct had caused discomfort during at least two basketball seasons, according to the person.","The families also told university officials that Hatchell had complained that her team played like “old mules” during a game against Georgia Tech — a remark that some took as a reference to female slaves and that caused at least one player to cry, according to the person.","In another instance, according to the person, the families said that Hatchell had warned that if U.N.C. turned in a middling performance against Louisville, “nooses” would await.","“If you guys play this way against Louisville, they’re going to take y’all outside with some nooses,” Hatchell said, according to the person, who was told of the remark by people who were present.","The reference to “nooses,” the person said, led to two apologies from Hatchell, the second because players thought the first one had lacked sincerity. The players remained frustrated with their coach but elected to wait until the off-season to address their concerns.","Smith said the coach had used different words when warning about the coming Louisville game. “She said words like: ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” the lawyer said.",Smith said his client “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”,Allegations of racism against Hatchell were first reported by The Washington Post.,"Five days after U.N.C.’s season ended, with a 20-point loss to California in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the families voiced their grievances in the meeting.","A North Carolina athletic department spokesman declined to comment. When the university announced the review on Monday, it said it was “committed to the well-being of our student-athletes and to ensuring that they have the best experience possible in and outside of competition.”","U.N.C. players either declined to comment or did not respond to messages. It was not clear which of the team’s players were represented when the relatives spoke with Cunningham and the other U.N.C. employees. No members of the coaching staff attended the meeting, which was organized after some players’ relatives held a conference call on March 25, the person said.","Smith said Thursday that the coach’s suggestion of the tomahawk chop, often seen at Florida State athletic events, was a motivational tool, and he said that Hatchell had often tried to commandeer the traditions of other schools to inspire her team.",The lawyer said that Hatchell had intended no offense in that episode and that she did not recall making any statements about “old mules.”,The person who described the allegations against Hatchell did not know of any specific accusations against the assistant coaches.,"The North Carolina women’s basketball team has had great success under Hatchell, particularly in the 1990s and the 2000s. The Tar Heels won their sole national championship in 1994.","Hatchell, who recently completed her 33rd season at North Carolina, is one of a handful of college basketball coaches with more than 1,000 career wins, and she is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In her first college coaching job, Hatchell oversaw the junior varsity team at Tennessee in the team’s first season under Pat Summitt, a trailblazing head coach.","But in this decade, North Carolina has only twice reached the second weekend of the N.C.A.A. tournament, both times thanks to four players from its highly regarded recruiting class in 2013. After two seasons, all four players had transferred out of the program. This year, the team finished at 18-15.","Smith said on Thursday that, despite the allegations, he hoped Hatchell would be able to return to coaching at North Carolina.","“I want her to,” he said. “I believe this is a case in which things are not what they seem.”","On Thursday morning, Hatchell’s executive assistant sent an email to season-ticket holders. The season-end banquet had been postponed.","“Those who have paid for tickets will be refunded,” the email said. “When the banquet is rescheduled, we will contact you with more information.”"
"An Artist on Finding Balance, and His Giant Basketball Sculpture - The New York Times","Jonas Wood’s East Hollywood studio — a refurbished industrial space hidden behind a razor-wired metal gate — is populated with the familiar objects that appear in his paintings. There are colonies of potted plants and basketball paraphernalia that ranges in size from plush couch cushions to man-sized orbs. Every room is filled with art, most notably by the ceramist Shio Kusaka, Wood’s studio mate and wife, and Kiki and Momo, their son and daughter. ","But the studio is where Wood culls various photographs from the internet or his own archive and uses them as source material for his paintings — they are printed out and pinned onto walls, then flattened and distilled into blocks of color. Wood then layers these dense graphic patterns, overlapping fields of stipples and stripes, circles, squares, dots and wood grains.","[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]","Thirteen years into his career, following a year and a half of preparation, Wood is finally wrapping up preparations for the two biggest shows he’s ever done: an exhibition of new work at Gagosian in New York, opening in late April, and a survey at the Dallas Museum of Art, opening this week — his first major solo museum exhibition. Admittedly, the prospect of facing works — landscapes, interiors and portraits of family and friends — from his early career was giving Wood “a hard time sleeping.” He wondered, “Are the old paintings horrible?” and “Did I used to be a better painter and now I’m worse?” During the installation of the show at the museum last week, he had two big realizations: “I wasn’t a hack, which is a big relief,” and that now, after more than a decade of steadily producing gallery shows, he might be ready to slow down.","Nursing a can of tangerine-flavored LaCroix, Wood answered T’s Artist’s Questionnaire, which unearthed memories of the early days of his career, the first painting he ever sold — and the YouTube videos that nearly brought him to tears.","What is your day like? How much do you sleep, and what’s your work schedule like?","I drop the kids off at school, eat some breakfast, start working a little bit, usually have a meeting, have lunch and work for a couple hours in the afternoon.

It’s not that I want to paint less, per se, but I want to take a step back.","I’m talking about taking a step back and looking at what I’ve done, and taking a step back from the pace that I was running and changing gears. After these two exhibitions, I don’t have any booked shows coming up. It’s a big opportunity for me to rearrange the way I spend my time.

I find a photograph that I like, and then I usually make drawings. Maybe half the time I paint from the drawings and the other half from photographs. I use the photo for the structure of the painting; I project out different shapes, trace it out, mix the colors and build an image, like a flat map, and then I paint all the details on top.

Basketball Is Beside the Point During N.B.A. All-Star Weekend - The New York Times,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Consider the following scenes from the N.B.A.’s annual bacchanal/business convention known as All-Star weekend:","Spike Lee standing on a street corner waiting for the crosswalk signal. Stan Kroenke, whose family owns the Denver Nuggets, holding court in a hotel lobby. Joel Embiid, the star center of the Philadelphia 76ers, making small talk with the governor of North Carolina. An army of personal stylists waiting to be summoned by their clients for some of the flashiest events of the year.","And then there were the agents and league officials and sneakerheads and reporters, some of whom traveled great distances to make unconventional requests of the weekend’s main attractions.",“Shout out to my fans in Mongolia!” John Collins of the Atlanta Hawks yelled into a camera the morning before his appearance in the Saturday slam dunk contest.,[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo’s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame],"All-Star weekend tends to be a blend of basketball and branding, business and pleasure — a showcase for a powerful league whose global influence continues to expand.","“The whole weekend,” Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies said, “is just a big party.”","The All-Star Game itself, scheduled for Sunday night, felt secondary to just about everything else in the host city, as it has for many years. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, recalled waiting in line in 2006 for one of the more popular parties at All-Star weekend in Houston, where he watched Maciej Lampe — a center from Poland who appeared in 64 career games over parts of three seasons — bypass the line so that he could immediately be waved inside by security.","“And I’m like, ‘Man, I’m behind Maciej Lampe?’” said Morey, who would officially join the front office of the Rockets a little more than six weeks later.","All-Star weekend has only grown in recent years. One spreadsheet making the rounds in Charlotte listed more than 100 parties, and that did not include many of the more exclusive events. (Michael Jordan hosted a big one.) Thanks to a change in the league schedule, there is more partying and less deal-making than there used to be.","Last year, the league moved the trade deadline up so that it preceded All-Star weekend. In the past, the deadline came a few days after the game, a sequence which helped create its share of absurdity. One of the more notorious examples came in 2017, when word leaked during the fourth quarter of the All-Star Game that the New Orleans Pelicans had struck a deal to acquire DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings. Cousins learned of the trade during postgame interviews.",The weekend vibe is different now.,"“It’s so much more fun,” one prominent agent said at a party that he hosted.","In the corner, a disc jockey who appeared to be in his 60s spun tunes in a Hawaiian shirt and red-tinted glasses, while women wearing bright red dresses passed out hors d’oeuvres. Agents, clients and marketing honchos milled about the room.",But none of this is meant to suggest that deals do not get done.,"On Thursday night, at a downtown hotel bar where patrons sipped $25 cocktails, a crowd of very tall men gathered as a private event wound down at a nearby steakhouse. Among the luminaries who emerged from the event: Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner; Kroenke, who also owns the Los Angeles Rams; Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s chief media and business officer; Bill Simmons, the founder of The Ringer; Connor Schell, ESPN’s executive vice president for content; and Bob Myers, the general manager of the Golden State Warriors.","“There are definitely conversations happening,” Morey said. “And there’s serendipity involved. You’re always bumping into people.”","Morey was finishing lunch at an upscale restaurant. Warren LeGarie, a longtime agent to many coaches and executives, and Kiki Vandeweghe, the league’s executive vice president for basketball operations, were dining at nearby tables. Morey was about to head into a meeting with Vandeweghe and Monty McCutchen, who supervises the league’s referees.","“Obviously, we care deeply about where the league is going,” Morey said, “so talking to Adam Silver about strategy or Monty McCutchen about changing how they might call certain things — all that kind of stuff could impact our franchise moving forward, so I try to be involved.”","The atmosphere may seem more relaxed than it was two years ago, when most team executives and agents were focused on the trade deadline, but the shift in the schedule has not pushed aside the league’s most pressing issues.","In Charlotte, a cloud loomed over the festivities, and it came in the shape of a unibrow.","Perhaps you have heard? Anthony Davis, the star center for the Pelicans, requested a trade 10 days before the deadline.","The Pelicans, though, rejected all trade offers for him and instead hope to reap better players and draft picks in a deal this summer. Last week, Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry called the drama of it all a “dumpster fire.” On Friday, the Pelicans fired their general manager. On Saturday, Davis told reporters that his list of preferred destinations included the Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. Hours later, Silver said he would like trade demands and discussions to remain behind closed doors.","In any case, the Davis situation only underscored how much the topic of player movement dominates the league — even in the middle of the season, and even after the trade deadline. Everyone here was fixated on what could happen just over four months from now — at the start of free agency.","Will Kevin Durant leave the Warriors? Will Kawhi Leonard spurn the Toronto Raptors? Will Kyrie Irving bolt from the Boston Celtics? And, again, what about Davis?","“No one likes to see an instance,” Silver said, “where a player is demanding that he be traded when he’s still in the middle of a contractual obligation to a team.”","Silver made those remarks, and his wish for private trade discussions, at a news conference before Saturday night’s skills, dunk and 3-point competitions.","The media forum, like the carefully coordinated outfits stars wore to events around town, has become part of the event’s routine.

Unvaccinated Student in Kentucky Sues After Being Barred From Playing Basketball - The New York Times,"A student at a Catholic school in Kentucky has sued the Northern Kentucky Health Department, claiming it violated his First Amendment rights by barring him from playing basketball because he refused to be vaccinated against chickenpox.","The lawsuit, filed last week in Boone County Circuit Court on behalf of the student, Jerome Kunkel, an 18-year-old senior, argues that the action violates his right to freedom of religion. Being vaccinated, it contends, would go against Mr. Kunkel’s religious beliefs as a practicing Catholic, because the vaccine contains “aborted fetal cells.”","The lawsuit came after an outbreak of chickenpox at Assumption Academy in Walton, Ky., prompted officials to send out two warnings in February.","On March 14, the Health Department issued a statement saying that because there had been 32 cases of chickenpox at the school, students who were not vaccinated or already immune could not attend school “until 21 days after the onset of rash for the last ill student or staff member.” The statement also said all school extracurricular events would be canceled.","Mr. Kunkel’s lawyer, Chris Wiest, said in an interview on Monday that the school had told him in February that he could not play in or attend any basketball games because he was not vaccinated.",Mr. Kunkel is also now barred from attending school because of the Health Department’s action.,"“I’m pretty devastated,” Mr. Kunkel, who was captain of the basketball team, said in an interview on Monday night. After playing for all four years of high school, “for it come crashing down at the end, it’s not very fun,” he added. Mr. Kunkel was not able to play in the last three games of the season.","The lawsuit contends that in Kentucky, students are allowed a vaccination exemption on religious grounds if they provide a sworn statement, which Mr. Kunkel did in early 2018.","The chickenpox vaccine is grown in cells originally derived from fetuses aborted in the early 1960s. Vaccines may contain nanofragments of DNA from the fetal cells, which are used because human viruses do not grow well in animal cells, according to a statement the vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, gave to ABC News.","It is unclear how many students have been barred from attending the school because they have not been vaccinated or were found to be immune. Mr. Wiest, however, said that the parents of at least 18 children at the school had contacted him since the Health Department’s announcement.","“I think this is going to be a much bigger fight at the end of the day,” Mr. Wiest said.",Officials at the school did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. But the Health Department defended its response to the outbreak.,"The action, the department said in its statement, was “in direct response to a public health threat and was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness.” A spokesman for the department declined to comment further."

U.N.C. Women’s Basketball Coach Sylvia Hatchell Faces a Reckoning - The New York Times,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Sylvia Hatchell, the University of North Carolina women’s basketball coach, used to preach about “the fishbowl.”","“You’re always in the fishbowl,” Hatchell would tell players like Tonya Sampson, a former player who recalled the admonitions in an interview on Friday. “You never know who’s watching. You’ve always got to carry yourself with integrity and the best way you can.”","Twenty-five years after Hatchell and Sampson won a national title for North Carolina, Hatchell’s reputation is in peril and her team is in turmoil. U.N.C. officials, who were told late last month about three episodes that some players thought revealed Hatchell to be racially insensitive and aloof, placed her and her assistants on paid administrative leave and opened a storied program to abrupt scrutiny.","An outside law firm is investigating. Several U.N.C. players are considering transferring. And Hatchell, 67, one of women’s basketball’s most successful and influential coaches and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, is not talking beyond a single written statement.","It seems no one, from high-ranking state lawmakers to parents of players, is certain whether she will coach again at U.N.C., a Southern powerhouse of athletics and academics that has spent years grappling with issues of race. Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, could only say, “I hope she does come back.”","The allegations against Hatchell, privately detailed to university officials on March 28 and in news media accounts in the week that followed, represent a grave test to her 33-year tenure at U.N.C., where she is under contract for just one more season. And although the just-concluded season was modestly more successful than other recent campaigns, Hatchell has lately led a program that felt removed from the one that, not long ago, routinely won at least 25 games a year.","This year, in its first appearance in the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament since the 2014-15 season, U.N.C. (18-15) exited in the first round with a 20-point loss to California.","Hatchell’s critics have been reluctant to speak publicly, in part, they said, because they fear retaliation. After so many years, Hatchell has become an institution at U.N.C., not quite on par with Dean Smith, the revered former men’s coach, but not far off. Many current and former players did not respond to messages, but some who did expressed support for Hatchell, even as they depicted her as a coach of searing, drawling intensity.",The university said it had hired a Charlotte law firm to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.” Officials have declined to comment beyond that.,The law firm is expected to examine the quality of medical care for players and whether Hatchell had warned her team that “nooses” would await them if they turned in a poor performance against Louisville. U.N.C. officials were also told that Hatchell had urged her players to perform a “tomahawk chop” war cry to fire them up — a suggestion the women resisted — and that she had described players as “old mules.” Some people perceived the comment as a reference to female slaves.,"Smith, Hatchell’s lawyer, said the coach “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”","He said some players had misconstrued Hatchell’s words, but he acknowledged that she had apologized after an internal uproar about the episode in which people recalled that she had referred to nooses.","“She said words like, ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” Smith said. He added that Hatchell, who did not believe she had said anything improper, initially apologized by saying something like, “I’m sorry you took it that way.”","“The team did not see that as an apology,” Smith said. “I think she thought she apologized.”","But a furor still built, and the university, whose trustees declined to comment or did not respond to messages, will soon have to decide the fate of the coach, who cultivated the modern women’s game and has been known more for her fiery courtside coaching than personal controversy.","“I never encountered any kind of racial slurs or racism,” said Nikki Teasley, a former U.N.C. point guard who went on to a long career in the W.N.B.A. “My experience with Coach Hatchell was very heartfelt, very loving, very kind.”","Teasley, who is African-American, said she did not recall any racially improper comments but did say Hatchell was fierce and demanding.","“After playing and then becoming a coach myself and then a mother,” she said, “you understand that sometimes things do get overheated, and in the heat of the moment you do say some things.”","Hatchell grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small city 20 miles west of Charlotte, and graduated from a public high school that had only recently integrated. Judge Jesse B. Caldwell III, who graduated from Hunter Huss High School a few years ahead of Hatchell, recalled little friction over integration in the area. Basketball, he said, helped bring people together. At nearby Ashley High School, an integrated team won a state championship in 1967.","Hatchell’s school did not have a women’s basketball team when she was a student. She began coaching as an undergraduate, and she took control of the North Carolina program, already an emerging incubator of basketball players, in 1986.","She became known as a skilled recruiter and drew some of the nation’s top basketball talent to Chapel Hill. Yet to people in and around her program, Hatchell sometimes seemed to be more of a chief executive than a coach. Andrew Calder, a Hatchell deputy since her arrival at U.N.C., was often credited with developing players.","“I learned the game through Coach Calder,” Sampson said. “You knew who the head coach was, but hands-on, no, she wasn’t hands-on when I was there.”","To a point, the formula worked. Lifted by a 3-point shot as time expired, the Tar Heels won their only women’s basketball title in 1994. Including that season, the Tar Heels have reached the Final Four three times — far less than programs like Connecticut, Tennessee and Notre Dame.","At their best, Hatchell’s teams played with an attractive, fast-paced style that relied on fast breaks and smart point-guard play. This season she continued to tout her up-tempo offense.","Hatchell’s stature has grown in a state where college basketball is prized. She missed one season, in 2013-14, for cancer treatment, but the next season North Carolina went 26-9 and finished with a No. 9 ranking.","Hatchell’s comeback era came as U.N.C. wrestled with an academic fraud scandal that reached into the women’s basketball program. Although the university was not punished, years of bad headlines, investigations and speculation took a toll. Some players cited the scandal when they chose to transfer elsewhere.","Hatchell, though, remained and, in 2016, received a contract extension. Last year, she signed a deal with Nike: $150,000 for up to four personal appearances a year until 2028. (The contract ends early if Hatchell leaves as head coach.)","Beyond basketball, Hatchell’s Christian faith has long been central to her life and her public persona. More than a decade ago, she started a women’s Bible study in the Chapel Hill area. For the last six years, the teacher has been Rachel-Ruth Wright, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the North Carolina evangelist.","“I’ve never heard her say one negative thing about any of her players,” Ms. Wright said. “She’s always positive, always excited. She’s just an encouragement all the time.”",The university’s investigation might answer if she went too far in doing so. The Charlotte Observer this week published a scathing editorial about the conduct of college coaches.,"“Other women’s basketball programs, including Georgia Tech, have fired coaches in recent years for mistreating players,” the paper, among the state’s most widely read, wrote. “If U.N.C. finds abuse from any coach — men’s or women’s — it should do the same.”","Weeks ago, Hatchell appeared in high spirits at a commemoration of U.N.C.’s only national title.","Hatchell visited a pregame lunch for members of that 1994 championship team, who were later honored on the court.","“She hugged me. ‘Glad to see you’ kind of thing,” Sampson said. “Then she was off, because she had to get prepared for the game.”"

Irvine, said in a telephone interview on Monday.","Of course, claims like these are hotly debated at this time of year. But on Sunday, the N.C.A.A. selection committee announced the 68 teams that will play in the Division I men’s basketball tournament, and only two of them were from California: U.C. Irvine and Saint Mary’s, which earned its bid by winning the West Coast Conference tournament.","Badrtalei certainly has a case. U.C. Irvine beat Saint Mary’s this season on its way to a 30-5 record, good enough to earn the team a No. 13 seed in the South Region of the N.C.A.A. tournament. U.C. Irvine will play Kansas State on Friday in San Jose.","The No. 13 seed means the Anteaters are an underdog in that game. But the team has also been a trendy upset pick among experts, some of whom think the team could make something of a Cinderella run.","“The Anteaters are a terrible draw for Kansas State, and their upset odds are two times better than you would expect for a typical No. 13 seed,” The Washington Post’s Neil Greenberg wrote Sunday after the bracket was unveiled. ",Badrtalei said this year’s team features several upperclassmen who have helped them beat squads like Texas A&M and Saint Mary’s on the road — wins that give the Anteaters confidence that they can hang with stiff competition.,"Veteran players like Jonathan Galloway, who is a first team all-conference selection, has helped anchor the Anteaters defensively. The team prides itself on rebounding well and being a “a real stubborn defensive team,” Badrtalei said, adding that Kansas State plays a similar style.","“We’re going to have to go out and play really well,” Badrtalei said of Friday’s matchup. “But these guys know their roles. They know what they’re doing. We purposely recruit guys who have a chip on their shoulders. We like that.

Defendants Receive Lenient Sentences in College Basketball Corruption Case - The New York Times,"A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday sentenced three men in a college basketball fraud case to between six and nine months in prison, lenient sentences that the judge said were nonetheless important to deter the funneling of money to the families of college basketball prospects — an N.C.A.A. violation that a jury found last year also constituted a felony.",The sentences come ahead of a second trial next month at which more may be revealed about how widespread the rot in recruiting has spread.,"James Gatto, the former head of global basketball marketing at Adidas, was sentenced to nine months by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Merl Code Jr., another former Adidas employee, and Christian Dawkins, an aspiring agent, were given six months each. Code and Dawkins, who are also defendants in next month’s trial, were ordered to pay restitution of a little more than $28,000 each, with Gatto’s amount of restitution still to be determined.",Kaplan ruled that the punishments would not go into effect until the appeal process is completed. The defendants have two weeks to ask the federal circuit court to re-examine the case.,"A jury convicted the three men last fall of defrauding the University of Louisville and, in Gatto’s case, also North Carolina State University and the University of Kansas. The men participated in a scheme in which the families of highly rated men’s basketball recruits were offered money in exchange for pledges to play for one of those teams, which are sponsored by Adidas. Prosecutors argued that by unknowingly making the universities vulnerable to N.C.A.A. sanctions, the defendants had victimized the schools.","Such offers are barred by N.C.A.A. rules, which require that college athletes adhere to the association’s policy of amateurism and not be compensated for their participation in their sport beyond a scholarship and related costs of attendance.","Repercussions from the charges brought by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York have already included the firing of a Hall of Fame coach — Rick Pitino, formerly of Louisville, who denies wrongdoing and whom prosecutors did not charge. A Kansas player was ruled ineligible early this year after his connection to the scheme came to light.",The lawyers for Code and Dawkins welcomed the sentence.,"“Happy might be the wrong word, but the judge granted a lenient sentence,” said Steve Haney, who represents Dawkins.","Haney also promised that the second trial, which involves alleged bribes to assistant coaches at top men’s basketball programs, would not only exonerate Dawkins but would also show how college basketball business is really done.","“We’re going to pull back the covers,” he said, adding, “This could transform college basketball and put the players in a situation moving forward so they and their labor are treated fairly.”",Haney pledged to put coaches on the stand — “as many as I can get into the courtroom.”,"Robert S. Khuzami, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in this case, said in a statement, “The sentences imposed today only begin to reflect the magnitude of the harm these defendants caused through a scheme that not only defrauded multiple public universities but upended the lives of young student-athletes and corrupted a game cherished by so many.”","Tuesday’s sentencing hearing in a packed courtroom on a high floor of the federal district building in downtown Manhattan saw all three defendants as well as their lawyers address the court and plead for leniency. They requested no jail time at all. While most of these statements referred to the defendants’ personal characters, some of the attorneys also pointed to the unusual nature of the case, which depended on a theory in which the universities were victimized by the defendants’ attempts to secure them top talent (albeit while putting them at risk of N.C.A.A. penalties).","“If he thought that anyone would conceive what he did here as a crime, he would never have done it,” Code’s lawyer, Mark Moore, said of his client.","Comparing the situation in the case to a legal principle called the “doctrine of unclean hands,” Moore suggested that widespread illicit activity in college recruiting called into question who was truly responsible for the harm his client had purportedly caused.","“Adidas has financial contracts with Louisville through which Louisville profited,” Moore said.","“You have not seen Louisville or any of these schools look to get out of their contracts with Adidas” since the scandal broke in 2017, he added.","Moore noted that although it was not admitted into the record before the jury, Kaplan seemed to recall an earlier scandal at Louisville in which a basketball staffer paid strippers and prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in on-campus housing.","Indeed, Kaplan himself appeared to raise so-called Strippergate, which resulted in N.C.A.A. penalties, during the prosecutor Edward B. Diskant’s statement to the court, in which Diskant insisted that the universities were the victims.","Kaplan said that the defendants had committed “a serious crime,” one whose purportedly common nature was not by itself exonerating: “The ‘everybody’s doing it’ argument, in short, is not a Get Out of Jail Free card,” he said.","But the judge also recognized that the alleged behavior of university employees like assistant coaches and, perhaps, the interests of the universities themselves complicated the theory of the case — on which a jury convicted — that the universities were victims.","Referring to Brian “Tugs” Bowen Jr., a prospect whose father testified that he had indirectly taken from Adidas in exchange for Bowen’s commitment to Louisville, Kaplan said, “To me, probably the worst, the most seriously injured victim of the Louisville scheme was Tug Bowen.” (Bowen was declared ineligible and is now playing professionally in Australia.)","On wiretaps, defendants made oblique references to their activity being typical of high-profile men’s college basketball. They also suggested that at least one of Adidas’s rivals were involved in similar schemes, though there have been no further charges.","Last year Yahoo Sports revealed documents that purported to show the families of several former stars who went on to play for many of the top college basketball programs were on the payroll of Dawkins, the aspiring agent.","The second case, scheduled to be tried next month, initially featured as defendants three former assistant coaches at major programs along with Dawkins and a money manager. The money manager, Munish Sood, reached a deal with prosecutors before the last trial and served as their witness. The three former assistants all pleaded guilty in January, after the guilty verdict in the first case.","A third case, whose trial is scheduled for later thus year, features the former Auburn assistant Chuck Person, who has been charged with bribery."

"A Star’s Shoe Breaks, Putting College Basketball Under a Microscope - The New York Times","When the left sneaker of college basketball’s biggest star split open on national television Wednesday night 30 seconds into the biggest game of the season, what spilled out was not only his foot but also questions about the future of a marquee player and about the huge influence shoe companies hold over big-time college basketball.","The episode occurred in a game between the archrivals Duke and North Carolina. Zion Williamson, a Duke freshman, pivoted with the ball above the foul line, and the sheer force of his 285-pound frame and acrobatic versatility appeared to cut the shoe almost in two, as though severed by a sharp knife.","Former President Barack Obama, sitting on the sidelines at the Duke arena, was seen on video pointing at Williamson and appearing to say, “His shoe broke.”","As the scene was replayed on countless highlight shows on Thursday, the damaged shoe threatened to become a nightmare for Nike, which pays tens of millions to elite college sports programs to be the exclusive sponsor for teams and supplier of their footwear.","With his shoe split and his knee sprained, Williamson, an unpaid, budding superstar, sat helpless on the arena floor, staring at the shoe he was wearing in part because of a rich deal between Nike and Duke, one of the world’s wealthiest universities.","Here were all the issues of big-time college sports laid bare: Should amateurism be curbed in college sports, allowing athletes a cut of the money they help produce? Should a prodigious talent like Williamson, who is good enough to play professionally right now, have to risk his future competing for free because of an N.B.A. rule prohibiting him from leaping to the league from high school? Do the sneaker companies, which were at the heart of a federal fraud trial near the start of the season, do more harm than good in college sports?","For a quarter of a century, Nike has been paying Duke tens of millions of dollars to sponsor its teams, and to ensure that its athletes wear only footwear bearing the company’s ubiquitous logo. The players receive enough shoes to carry them through the season, allowing them to serve largely as free human billboards.","“All this does,” Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane’s sports law program, said of Williamson’s injury, “is put a magnifying glass on an issue that has existed for a long time.”",Williamson has not commented.,"Nike stock closed down Thursday by 1.05 percent, as the world wondered how a sneaker could split so badly in the middle of a game.","The answer remains a puzzle even to experts. James Gilbert, an orthopedic surgeon who worked with Duke athletics in the 1990s, said he had seen shoes fall apart similarly on soccer players, but never on the hardwood.","“I think it’s a product failure,” Gilbert said. “I’ve never seen that. I had no idea that that happens.”","In a statement Wednesday night, Nike said: “We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery. The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.” The statement called the shoe explosion “an isolated occurrence,” though in 2015, the Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon even as the insoles of his Nike shoes slipped out of place.","Williamson, who has a mild knee sprain, will probably be sidelined for one to two weeks, and then continue being the favorite to become the No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft in June. By then, he will probably already be a millionaire, because of the endorsement deals he can sign when he ends his college career. For now, he is an N.C.A.A. amateur.","Sneaker companies first became deeply involved with college athletics in the late 1970s, when an enterprising Nike executive, Sonny Vaccaro, arranged for several prominent coaches, such as John Thompson of Georgetown and Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada-Las Vegas, to receive money in exchange for outfitting their players in the company’s shoes. Starting in the late 1980s, Nike began to sign deals that covered all of a university’s teams.","“Now we see the kids wearing the shoes and selling the product all over the world — and the kids never got anything,” Vaccaro, who left Nike years ago, said Thursday. “The money has served the same people, except for the most important ones.”",A decision in a federal class-action lawsuit challenging N.C.A.A. restrictions on compensation is expected any day.,"Standout basketball players were squeezed further in 2006, when the N.B.A. barred talented teenagers from following in the footsteps of Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James by entering the league straight out of high school.","Then, in September 2017, federal prosecutors in New York’s Southern District revealed more of the chasm between college basketball players, who can receive only scholarships and related costs of being on campus, and the administrators and coaches who reap the benefits of the revenue the athletes generate for their colleges, conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. The men’s basketball tournament yields about $1 billion a year for the television rights.","In three complaints filed in United States District Court in New York, prosecutors accused roughly a dozen assistant coaches, middlemen and employees of Adidas of plotting to funnel money to players’ families in exchange for pledges that the athletes, among other things, would play for certain universities and sign with Adidas once they began their pro careers. The scandal led to the firing of a Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino of the University of Louisville, and has netted three convictions, including of Adidas’s former director of global sports marketing.","The transactions outlined by the complaints are practically the modus operandi at many top basketball programs, documents and testimony in the legal case suggested. Wiretaps revealed suspects describing at least one Adidas rival engaging in similar practices. Documents from the case reported by Yahoo Sports last year indicated that former top players at dozens of prominent programs — including Duke — had been on the payroll of an aspiring agent who has since been convicted of fraud.",Duke did not reply to requests for comment Thursday.,"The specifics of Duke’s deal with Nike, which the two sides have extended through 2027, are not publicly known. As a private university, Duke is not obligated to reveal the terms.",But a look at Nike deals with similar universities that are public offer some indication of how the contracts work.,"Nike’s deal with North Carolina, for instance, will give the university more than $90 million in cash and merchandise over 10 years. Nike also signed personal contracts with a number of North Carolina coaches: Roy Williams, the men’s basketball coach, will receive an average of $300,000 a year over the life of the 10-year agreement.","Contracts generally state that Nike is not liable for injuries suffered by athletes wearing its products. The contracts also require every player to wear the company’s shoes unless a medical condition makes Nike footwear unsuitable. A player might, as stipulated in Nike’s deal with the University of Michigan, be required to make himself available for examination by Nike or a local podiatrist before using a shoe made by another company.","It is not known why Williamson wore the particular Nike model that tore on Wednesday. It was a Nike “signature shoe,” a term for a style endorsed by a specific athlete — in this case, the N.B.A. star Paul George, who plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder.","What makes Williamson so compelling is the same thing that might make a shoe unable to contain him. He combines size and speed with strength and agility in the manner of James, who during a day off this month went to Charlottesville, Va., to see Williamson and the Blue Devils take on Virginia. Though Williamson weighs 285 pounds, at times he seems like the fastest player on the court.","“When you’re dealing with some of these athletes who are getting quicker, stronger, faster, you’ve got to consider some of that,” said Gilbert, the orthopedist."

"Growing Up in New York, Just Like Holden and Francie. Only With Basketball. - The New York Times",THE FALCONER By Dana Czapnik 278 pp. Atria Books. $25.,"Toward the end of “The Falconer,” Dana Czapnik’s electric debut novel, 17-year-old Lucy Adler looks up from Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex” at the Japanese maple on her Upper West Side neighbor’s terrace. It’s difficult to read the passage and not think of beloved Francie Nolan peering out another window in another New York City borough, almost 100 years earlier. Yet whereas in “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” both Francie and the Tree of Heaven grow up amid an unforgiving, concrete urban setting, Czapnik’s maple has been coaxed and cared for, its leaves treated with a protective coating. Lucy, a middle-class Manhattanite attending an elite private school, has battled none of the Nolan family’s hardships, nor is she plagued by the acerbic ennui that Holden Caulfield gave voice to in “The Catcher in the Rye,” but comparisons to both classic New York bildungsromans nonetheless seem inevitable. That is, until you realize that what binds them — all tell of a determinedly independent young hero’s quest for selfhood catalyzed by the crucible of New York City — is also what makes them so resistant to comparison. Like Francie and Holden before her, Lucy, a street-smart, superlative basketballer vulnerable to the perils of approaching womanhood, is too carefully drawn to be equated with anyone else.","Lucy’s fierce first-person point of view is as confident and fearless as she is on the court; she narrates her story with the immediacy and sharpness of a sports commentator, mixed with the pathos and wisdom of a perceptive adolescent charting the perils of her senior year of high school. A self-described “pizza bagel — a Jewish and Italian mutt-girl,” Lucy grapples with the rigid expectations of others, especially her harshly critical high school peers who have rendered her an outcast. “Isn’t it just so much easier for everybody when a girl fits into a nice little girl category — good girl slut tomboy girly girl smart girl ditz — instead of being a fully fleshed-out person who is in constant conversation … with all the various fractious parts of herself,” Lucy wisely observes. We watch that conversation unfold in real time through her adventures with her best friend, Alexis, a tough-talking Dominican sage tethered to Lucy through basketball and their shared outsider status; Lucy’s forays into the navel-gazing Downtown arts scene of her painter cousin, Violet; and, most pulverizing, her unrequited love for her emotionally unavailable scrimmage partner Percy, a self-proclaimed nihilist from a neglected but moneyed family who goes through girlfriends like Kleenex and is referred to by friends as the “Virgin Surgeon.”","But it’s arguably the nonhuman characters that give true shape to Lucy’s evolution: basketball and New York. (The novel’s opening line, “The ball is a face,” confirms the game’s significance and anthropomorphism for her.) Only with ball in hand does Lucy feel invincible and most herself, even as that self changes: “I ought not to imbue a ball with so much magic, but when I’m holding one I go from Lucy Adler, invisible girl … to Lucy Adler, Warrior Goddess.” Her self-descriptions on the court are as visceral and vivid as any sex scene, and when the actual sex scene does eventually unfold it is against the backdrop of a Rangers game on television, the commentators’ play-by-play mirroring Lucy’s own disembodied narration of her experience.","The basketball grows into a metaphor for the universe: “I bounce the world hard on the blacktop, and it comes back into my hand covered with a fine layer of New York City diamond dust.” The entire novel is indeed cloaked in just such a glimmering film, and Lucy’s love-hate relationship with her roiling city reflects her changeable hopes for herself and others. “I guess New York is like that, in that what you mistake it for matters as much as what it actually is.” Czapnik, who herself grew up in Manhattan around the same time as Lucy, captures nostalgia — for both a vanishing New York and Lucy’s evaporating childhood — with the lucidity of a V.R. headset. The early-90s era seems unremarkable to the characters in the thick of it — “We live in … insignificant times,” Lucy says between hits of a joint — but feels poignantly pre-9/11 to today’s reader.","Lucy’s coming-of-age is tempered by her constant brush-ups against the constrictions society places on her sex. Happening upon “The Falconer,” a bronze of a boy in Elizabethan dress releasing a falcon in Central Park, Lucy is envious that statues of boys depict them in action poses while women are either demure nudes or Alice in Wonderland. “Don’t you wish they made statues of girls like that?” Lucy asks Alexis. “Just some girl having unapologetic fun.” Alexis replies: “I never apologize for the fun I have. And neither do you.” Reader, beware: Spending time with Lucy is unapologetic fun, and heartbreak, and awe as well."
Who? Two Seniors Climb Into Top 10 on College Basketball’s Career Scoring List - The New York Times,"BUIES CREEK, N.C. — With three seconds left in the first half last Wednesday night, Campbell point guard Chris Clemons was fouled on a layup. He banged the floor in frustration as the ball rimmed out, then rose and hit both free throws. Someone in the sparsely populated stands yelled, “Congratulations, Chris!” Given the size of the crowd, it’s almost certain Clemons heard him.","The second free throw was Clemons’s 22nd point of the night, and the 2,952nd of his four-season career at Campbell, a private university about an hour’s drive south of Raleigh, N.C., his hometown. It also meant Clemons, a senior, had entered the top 10 of the men’s Division I college basketball career scoring list, passing the former Kansas star Danny Manning. By the end of the game, when Clemons had finished off a season-high 48-point effort, he had passed Oscar Robertson, too.","“It’s kind of a gift and a curse that you’re not really able to enjoy the moment — or that I chose not to, rather,” Clemons said. “I do understand the significance of the events.”","History is being made in college basketball this season, but not all of it is being made for teams that are likely bound for the Final Four or by players who are projected to be selected early in the next N.B.A. draft.","With 3,006 career points at Campbell, Clemons is two behind Hersey Hawkins, the former Bradley player, for eighth all time, heading into Thursday’s game with High Point. At South Dakota State, another senior, Mike Daum, is poised to break into the top 10 by season’s end; with 2,943 points, he could pass Manning in the Jackrabbits’ game on Thursday against Fort Wayne.","It is an unignorable fact that most of the players still ahead of Clemons and Daum on the career scoring list are not household names, either. After Hawkins, for instance, Clemons could pass Keydren Clark, who played for St. Peter’s, in Jersey City; Harry Kelly of Texas Southern, in Houston; and perhaps even Alphonso Ford of Mississippi Valley State, who holds fourth place with 3,165 points. (First place, by a country mile, with 3,667 points, is the Louisiana State legend Pete Maravich, even though he played only three seasons.)","“I recognize that a lot of people on that list, who scored a lot of points in college, didn’t go on to have successful N.B.A. careers,” said Hawkins, who did have a successful N.B.A. career and now works for the Portland Trail Blazers.","Freeman Williams — who is second, and the scorer of 3,249 points for Portland State — acknowledged that his college years had been his glory days. “I got most of my attention as a basketball player back then,” he said.","Clemons and Daum fit in the same category. Daum is a two-time (and probable three-time) Summit League player of the year. Clemons is leading all Division I players in scoring this season, averaging nearly 30 points a game. Although both are likely to get opportunities to shine during the N.B.A.’s summer league or on its development league rosters, said Fran Fraschilla, the former coach and ESPN draft analyst, the 6-foot 9-inch Daum is at best a late-second-round draft pick. Clemons, who is listed at 5-9, is unlikely to be drafted at all.","The relative anonymity of college basketball’s leading career scorers appears to be a feature, not a bug. If you are scoring so many points for so much time, you most likely are not doing so at college basketball’s heights.","“If Mike Daum or Chris Clemons had gone to play in the Big Ten or the A.C.C.,” Fraschilla said last week, referring to the Atlantic Coast Conference, “they wouldn’t be on the verge of scoring 3,000 points.”","He added, “As good players as they are, they would be on teams with other really talented players, as opposed to going to a school like S.D.S.U. or Campbell, where virtually from Day 1 their talent was such that they were the dominant player not only on their team but in their league.”","And had they dominated as they have in a bigger league, they probably wouldn’t be seniors; the best college basketball players are around for only one or two seasons.","“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said Lionel Simmons, who is third with 3,217 career points for La Salle. “Some of these players, if they didn’t come out early, they could have scored 3,000.”","But even when top talents played for three or four college seasons, they did so for top teams whose other talented players lowered the individual demands on them. Superlative college players like U.C.L.A.’s Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Georgetown’s Patrick Ewing had the kinds of supporting casts that come with championship teams.","The most prominent name in the top 20, after Robertson, is Larry Bird, who played most of his college career at Indiana State, a team that he led to the Final Four, but one that needed him to average 30 points a game. But a place on the list can still be a point of pride years later.","Hawkins acknowledged that he kept tabs on developments in the career scoring top 10. In 2014, a Blazers scout was at the Creighton game in which Doug McDermott, now of the Indiana Pacers, passed Hawkins. “He was texting me, ‘Six points away,’ ‘Two points away,’” Hawkins said. “He thought it was funny. I was sitting at dinner getting texted every three minutes.”","Last week, Clemons deflected postgame questions about passing Manning and Robertson, saying he was focused on this season, in which the Fighting Camels (15-11) are third in the Big South. Asked whether he had kept the game ball, he laughed; of course he had not.","“After it’s all said and done, I’ll definitely go back and look, reminisce on the years I’ve had here, kind of be amazed at myself, know what I was able to accomplish,” Clemons said.","Like Clemons, Daum emphasized in a telephone interview that he has been putting his team first. Still, he said, he could not help noticing recently when he passed Bird, as well as Duke’s J. J. Redick and North Carolina’s Tyler Hansbrough, two stars from the last decade whom Daum had grown up watching.","“I feel like I’m going to look back on it” — his eventual scoring total — “maybe when I’m older, and be like, ‘See how cool it was to be in that position,’” Daum said.","“For me personally,” he added, “it’s just getting ready for the next thing.”"
Zion Williamson and Ja Morant Lead College Basketball’s Dunking Renaissance - The New York Times,"Fans tuning in to Saturday’s marquee matchup between Duke and Virginia waited less than two minutes before getting what they came for. On an early Virginia possession, Duke’s Zion Williamson, the impossible freshman who moves with a guard’s agility while weighing 280 pounds, recovered a loose ball and hammered down a two-handed dunk with Old Testament fury.",Williamson is expected to be the top pick in this year’s N.B.A. draft and has been this season’s signature player — a quality so inseparable from his ferocious slams that a rare missed dunk last week against Boston College became a highlight in its own right.,"The only other player who has come close to capturing the collective imagination as Williamson is Murray State’s Ja Morant, a 6-foot-3 sophomore who has played his way from virtual anonymity to likely top-five draft position on a diet of Jordan-esque leaping, flying slams.","That Williamson and Morant are this season’s college basketball folk heroes is in one sense entirely logical. Dunks are popular, they dunk well, therefore they are popular.","Yet in the context of recent history and current basketball trends, they are outliers as stars because they are relatively poor shooters from long distance.","Neither player can efficiently utilize the 3-pointer, which has cemented itself as the most treasured tool in the modern offensive game. Williamson has made less than 30 percent of the 47 3-pointers he has attempted. Morant is at 32.7 percent, below the Division I average of 34.3 percent.","Williamson’s attitude toward the 3-pointer may be best summarized not by any of his own shots, but by his sensational block of De’Andre Hunter’s ill-fated attempt late in Saturday’s game, an 81-71 Duke victory.","Their proficiency in dunking over long-distance shooting signals how special they are, of course, but also might herald a market correction in which basketball’s most reliable shot is back in.","In recent seasons, the defining players — the ones who made the biggest impacts and summed up the college basketball zeitgeist — have overwhelmingly been sharpshooters. Think of Oklahoma’s Trae Young and Buddy Hield, Kansas’ Frank Mason III, Indiana’s Yogi Ferrell, Purdue’s Caleb Swanigan and even Duke’s infamous Grayson Allen. The last 7-footer to be named player of the year, Wisconsin’s Frank Kaminsky, was not a high-volume shooter of 3s, but he made 41.6 percent of his attempts in his Wooden Award-winning season. Villanova won a title at the buzzer when Kris Jenkins hit a 3.","Yet this year’s watch list for the Wooden Award includes Williamson and Morant along with other poor-shooting yet exciting non-big men like Duke’s R.J. Barrett and Tennessee’s Grant Williams. Marquette’s Markus Howard has received comparatively little attention as this year’s exemplary high-volume, high-accuracy distance shooter.",The ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said dunks were emerging as more crucial to offenses because so-called midrange shots — 2-point attempts that are not from close in near the basket — have been so devalued by analytics. Get to the rim. Get fouled. Or take a 3. Those are the modern basketball credos.,"Bilas said it was possible that, after several years in which the 3-pointer has predominated in top offenses, coaches have improved at devising defenses to stymie perimeter shooting — in that way placing a premium on wing players who excel at close range. But mainly Williamson and Morant stand out because they are standouts.","“We’re seeing more dunks because there are more spectacular athletes out there,” he said.","“A lot of guys can dunk, but he dunks on the way up,” he added of Williamson. “His head is literally at or over the rim every time.”","Recent seasons’ emphasis on the 3 was easy to understand if you looked to the N.B.A.’s discovery of the 3-pointer’s efficiency. The Golden State Warriors emerged as a dynasty thanks in part to their high-volume 3-point shooting, and even they have been surpassed by teams like the Houston Rockets who attempt 3s at record numbers while confining their other shots to the restricted area under the basket.","Meanwhile, the trey picked up a cachet that had previously been reserved only for the jam. Players who sank one from deep mimicked bow-and-arrow shots toward their benches, igniting their teammates; Stephen Curry, Hield and Young became the players youngsters aspired to play like.","And to be sure, 3-pointers have not gone away. This season they account for nearly a third of the points scored in Division I, according to KenPom.com, the highest ever and part of a steady upward trajectory. Teams are making 34.3 percent of attempts, which is just a few fractions of a percent off the past couple years’ heights.","What have positively plummeted are, as Bilas suggested, midrange attempts. According to Ken Pomeroy, KenPom.com’s proprietor, midrange shots — defined essentially as 2-point attempts beyond a couple feet from the basket — account for barely a quarter of total field goal attempts this season. That figure was 33 percent as recently as the 2012-13 season.","“The 15- to 20-footers are becoming extinct,” Pomeroy said in an interview.","With players setting up farther from the basket, the dunk opportunity has opened perhaps more than ever before. And into that breach have stepped an uncommonly talented crop of dunkers.","“This is the best dunking college basketball has seen in a while,” said Chuck Millan, a dunk coach involved not only with high schoolers but with the N.B.A.’s dunk contest, which will be staged Saturday night.","Millan highlighted lesser known players with sensational abilities, including Connecticut’s Kwintin Williams, Florida Gulf Coast’s Troy Baxter and Arkansas-Little Rock’s Rayjon Tucker — “a freak of nature,” as Millan put it.","As for Williamson and Morant, Millan said that, as with chocolate and vanilla, a comparison comes down to personal preference — although he may ultimately fall on Team Zion.","“With Ja, it’s the dunks in traffic, because he’s little, and the body contact he takes,” Millan said. “Zion, being 6-8, 280, seeing him be just so agile and almost ballerina-like, being such a huge dude — it’s more impressive.”"
"Modern Basketball: Meet the Two-Mom, Two-Coach, Three-Kid Family - The New York Times","ALBANY — Lauren Mullen pulled her black hat low over her eyes, paid $10 for a ticket and entered Sefcu Arena just before tip-off recently. She sat in Section 150. There were 18 rows between her and any other fans. She trained her focus on the two head coaches.","On the visiting bench sat the University of Massachusetts, Lowell coach, Tom Garrick, a former N.B.A. player. Last spring, Mullen, then the women’s basketball coach at New York University, interviewed for the position that Garrick now holds. It was the third time in four years that she had been a finalist for a Division I head-coaching job. Her résumé included a 103-58 record and five postseason berths with the Violets.","On the home sideline stood Mullen’s wife, Colleen, the coach of SUNY Albany. Colleen got the job one month after Lauren lost out to Garrick. An associate coach at West Point for six years, Colleen reached the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament twice. When Albany hired Colleen, Lauren resigned from N.Y.U. to stay at home with their children: Maggie, 3, and their 1-year-old twins, Brennan and Callan.","“When you think about it, if I had gotten the Lowell job, I would’ve been over there,” Lauren said, pointing to Garrick. And Colleen, she added, would have been with the children. “Crazy, just crazy,’’ she said.","It is, though, the path they are taking as a same-sex coaching couple with three small children and all sorts of demands and challenges. ","Indeed, Colleen joined a small sorority when Albany hired her. Although the Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage three years ago and college campuses can be among the more progressive places in the United States, Colleen says she is one of only five women she knows of who are openly gay head coaches in college basketball. She recalled how Sue Johnson, her coach at the University of New Hampshire at the time who is now the athletic director at Concord Academy in Massachusetts, came out 16 years ago, when Colleen was a senior. At the time, Johnson’s longtime partner, Kelly, was pregnant, and Johnson informed the team of their relationship after a practice.","It was the chaos familiar to a lot of dual-income households that led Lauren and Colleen to a crossroads last winter. After four years of matching basketball calendars to Colleen’s biological clock to plan births for the off-season, timing recruiting calls around nap schedules, and wrestling with nanny problems and a merry-go-round of fill-in babysitters, they needed a change. ","“We were at a breaking point,” Colleen said. “A lot of coming and going.”","“Absolute insanity,” Lauren said. “To be frank, at the end of last year, it was like, ‘O.K., what are we going to do?’”","Both 38, the Mullens knew one of them needed to get a Division I head coaching job so the other could afford to step back into a supporting role. ","A pact was made early on. They would not pursue the same jobs, though they had competed for employment once before. ","That occurred when they met, in 2007. At the time, Lauren was a graduate assistant at Lehigh. There was an opening for an assistant coaching position, and Lauren applied for the internal promotion. Colleen, then an assistant at Southern New Hampshire University, also applied. They possessed similar credentials. Colleen stood 5 feet 2 inches and had starred at the University of New Hampshire as a pass-first point guard. Lauren was 5-foot-4, and was a facilitator at Hofstra. Colleen, who is six months older, got the job. ","Soon after, they played one-on-one for the first and only time. Lauren beat Colleen. Any lingering tension turned to mutual interest. On opening day of practice that season, they went on their first date.","“She didn’t hate me for that long,” Colleen said. “She got a master’s from Lehigh. She’s in good shape.”","Early in their relationship, they visited Colleen’s family. While there, they realized they had played in the same Florida tournament when they were 13. Colleen found a photo that captured Lauren guarding her on an inbounds play.","They kept their relationship quiet as they began to climb the coaching ladder, drawing interest from South Carolina to Connecticut. Once, while Colleen was at Long Island University and Lauren was at Sacred Heart in Connecticut, they were in the same conference. L.I.U. beat Sacred Heart both times they played.","“I slept on the couch,” Colleen said. “It’s fine.”","“She’s lying,” Lauren said. “She would have made me sleep on the couch. Takes her a little time to let the steam off.”","Colleen went north to West Point to become an assistant coach in June 2011. Weeks later, President Obama ended the United States military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, the 17-year-old law that banned openly gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from military service. Colleen then found herself in competition with Lauren once more, this time for a recruit. Her name was Kelsey Minato, from Huntington Beach, Calif. ","Minato was a prolific outside scorer and Lauren was the first to reach out to her. She and Colleen had sat side-by-side in the stands watching Minato at a tournament in Arizona, and Colleen encouraged Lauren to speak with Minato’s coach afterward. Lauren followed through. ","A few weeks later, Army realized it needed a guard, and Colleen asked Lauren whether she would mind if Army pursued Minato. Lauren welcomed the competition. Minato was unaware of the relationship between the recruiters, and narrowed her choices to Sacred Heart and Army. She eventually became the best player in Army history, scoring 49 points in one game, breaking records and having her No. 5 jersey retired.","“I was going to ride that wave for a long time, have a nice halo around my head for finding her,” Colleen said.","But it was Lauren who became a head coach first. That summer, she signed on to lead N.Y.U. While Colleen sold recruits on West Point’s structure, Lauren pitched West Fourth Street’s freedom. One day, Lauren announced that practice was canceled. In came the West Point women in camouflage gear for a boot camp.","“My players were all like, ‘Oh, no!’” Lauren said. “They wanted no part.’’","In any case, wins at both programs followed, along with a wedding in May 2014. ","“New experience for me,” said Dave Magarity, the head coach of the West Point women’s team. “There were a lot of cigars floating around.”","The Mullens were living in Ossining, N.Y. — 26 miles from West Point, 36 miles from Greenwich Village. And Colleen, known as The Mullenator at West Point, recalled that Magarity defended her sexual orientation. When a recruit’s parent asked which members of his staff were married, Magarity said, “Don’t ever ask that question again.”","“Dave was like papa bear,” Colleen said.","Last May, Albany, which has reached six of the last seven N.C.A.A. tournaments, hired Colleen as its head coach. After starting 1-9, the Great Danes have gone 10-5 and are tied for third place in the America East.","As a head coach, Colleen, who has been openly gay since college, now finds herself calculating when to mention Lauren, who came out when she was in her mid-20s. ","“When I am talking to certain people, and I bring up my wife, there’s a second thought in my head,” Colleen said. “It’s like, ‘Should I just talk about my kids?’ It doesn’t feel right when you censor yourself.”","Up in the stands, it has not taken long for Lauren to find her voice as a spectator. When the season schedule was announced, she cleared her calendar to be in attendance at Albany’s opener at the University of South Florida. She had not been able to make one of Colleen’s games in years. In the stands, Lauren described herself as “out of control.’’","“I knew it, but I couldn’t help myself,’’ Lauren said. “I was like, I need to calm down, but then I’d say, ‘That’s a walk! They walked!’” ","She and Colleen bought a house in Bethlehem, N.Y., last August. On a recent night there, Maggie played with Disney princess stamps as Lauren cut chicken nuggets for the boys. A chalkboard featured a to-do list above a diagram of “Double Horns,” an offensive set.","“We’re like a sociology experiment because Maggie wants gowns and she’d maybe seen her moms in like 10 dresses combined,” Lauren said. The boys, she added, had all girls toys to choose from but are indicating an interest in trucks.","And Maggie is learning what comes with winning. After a victory over the University of Maryland Baltimore County, the Great Danes awaited Colleen in the home locker room. Maggie was hesitant to go inside, so Lauren let her know that she would be waiting in the hallway. After Maggie and Colleen entered, the door closed behind them. A roar could be heard as guard Kyara Frames lifted Colleen in the air, per their celebratory custom. Eleven seconds later, Maggie ran out crying.","“Mom’s having fun,” Lauren told her. “The girls are having fun.”"
North Carolina Women’s Coaches Put on Leave - The New York Times,The University of North Carolina has put the staff of its women’s basketball team on indefinite leave pending an investigation into the program.,"In a statement, the university said the investigation was prompted by “issues raised by student-athletes and others.”","A Charlotte law firm will review the program. The head coach, Sylvia Hatchell, and her three assistants will be paid during the investigation.","“Of course, I will cooperate fully in this review,” Hatchell said in a statement Monday, after the university announced its decision. “I look forward to a prompt conclusion of this matter and the continuation of our very successful women’s basketball program.”","Hatchell, who has coached the team since 1986, is in the basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. She won the national championship in 1994 and made two other Final Fours.","Several highly touted players have transferred away from North Carolina in recent years, notably Diamond DeShields, who despite a strong freshman year on court moved on to Tennessee and then the W.N.B.A.","Hatchell, 67, was found to have leukemia in 2013, but after treatment returned to the team.","This season North Carolina was 18-15 and returned for the first time in four years to the N.C.A.A. tournament, where it lost in the first round.","But her tenure recently has been rocky. Most notably, the team was at the center of an N.C.A.A. investigation into fake African Studies classes largely populated by athletes who got high grades for little, if any, work.","Many of the accusations in the case focused on Jan Boxill, an academic adviser to the women’s basketball team, who was said to have improperly helped players academically and steered them to the bogus courses. She eventually resigned from the university.",The N.C.A.A. eventually ruled that the team would receive no penalties because the classes were also available to nonathletes.,The university has not elaborated on the nature of the complaints that prompted the new investigation.
"Arike Ogunbowale Is Ready for Her Next Shot, in the W.N.B.A. - The New York Times","For Arike Ogunbowale, the trip to the top of the Empire State Building on Wednesday was unusually fast.","It had been arranged for her to bypass the lines and take express elevators to the observatory on the morning she was to become a professional basketball player. In the hours leading to the 2019 W.N.B.A. draft, these kinds of experiences did not faze Ogunbowale. Not after she had become one of the most recognizable faces in college basketball after hitting a pair of buzzer-beaters for Notre Dame in last year’s Final Four — one to slay Connecticut, the other to best Mississippi State and win the national championship.","“Nah, I’m used to life throwing new things at me now,” Ogunbowale said with a smile as she looked out over the New York skyline.","Even for the relentless Ogunbowale, the past week has brought a particular kind of whiplash.","On Wednesday night, the Dallas Wings selected her fifth in the draft, after the Las Vegas Aces took her college teammate Jackie Young with the top pick.","“You know, Dallas is a great place, and they have a great coach there, so I’m really excited,” Ogunbowale said, referring to Brian Agler, who has won the league title with teams in Seattle and Los Angeles. “I’m ready to get started.”","The draft followed her vintage set of performances in this season’s Final Four: 23 points in another win over Connecticut, and a game-high 31 points in the national title game against Baylor. Ogunbowale’s final shots came after a drive to the basket that yielded two free throws in the waning seconds, her team trailing by 2 points.","Then, the unthinkable: a miss. And a championship lost. Ogunbowale’s painful moment played out on the national stage, too, amplified in part by her previous success. Her mother, Yolanda, raced down from the stands after the game to reassure her, to say how proud she was.","“Over time, she’s going to realize that she won’t be defined by that moment,” Yolanda said Wednesday, hours before her daughter would hear her name called at the W.N.B.A. draft at Nike’s New York headquarters. “I was just hurting for her, and for her teammates, because they wanted it so bad.”","And there would be no time to process. A late Sunday night game turned into a Monday morning flight to South Bend, Ind., where Ogunbowale has one more class to complete at Notre Dame before she graduates.","Then it was onto New York, to see the realization of a professional dream that dates back to high school in Wisconsin, though first Ogunbowale had to choose basketball over soccer. (Oddly enough, Baylor recruited her for soccer.) She and her mother both say she could have gone pro in that, too. Confidence, backed up by results, runs in the family.","The path Ogunbowale chose has worked out pretty well. Over these last few days, her strength and her network of fans have fed off each other. Yolanda said Arike’s bubbly personality had drawn people into her orbit since she was a little girl.","Fans recognized her at the airport as she headed back to school, and some approached to cheer her up. People took notice, too, up on the Empire State Building observation deck. For Ogunbowale, it is becoming clearer that everyone still sees in her that dynamic personality, that same person who hit buzzer-beaters, who scored 55 in a high school game, who can count LeBron James and Kobe Bryant among her fans.","“Kobe, LeBron, all of them, they’ve missed some important shots in their lifetime,” Ogunbowale said. “It’s a part of the game, you know? I’m not going to be able to make every shot. So I’m glad about my career, and I think I had a great four years. Everybody’s been telling me that. I mean, that’s just one shot. But what you’ve done these four years for the program, for just women’s basketball in general, is big.”","How big? After the loss, Bryant reached out directly to encourage her. There seems to be something about Ogunbowale that make people root for her (unless they are part of the Connecticut faithful, that is).","And as her mother explained, Ogunbowale engenders a two-way connection, something of particular import for W.N.B.A. teams hoping to win both on the court and at the box office.","Liamani Segura, the 10-year-old girl who sang the national anthem at the title game, wanted a picture with Ogunbowale. Segura’s father worried Ogunbowale wouldn’t want to take one after such a difficult loss. But, as Segura’s father later told Yolanda, Arike approached Segura on her own for that photograph.","“So that’s the type of person she is,” Yolanda said of her daughter. “The person who, in the midst of that pain, she took her time to do that.”","And so while few expected Ogunbowale to be the first overall pick on Wednesday night, everyone wanted to hear from her, as she headed to Bleacher Report to talk about her favorite sneakers and to CBS for an on-camera interview, before getting down to the serious business of choosing a draft night outfit.","Erin Kane, Ogunbowale’s agent, had selected several options, and they headed to Express to see a stylist.","“You look great in a jumpsuit,” the stylist said as Ogunbowale settled on a sea-foam green one.","“Oh, I know,” Ogunbowale replied, ready for her close-up."
N.B.A. Size? Check. N.B.A. Future? That’s More Complicated. - The New York Times,"Seven years ago, Tacko Fall and Christ Koumadje were discovered by basketball scouts in a similar fashion.",They were hard to miss.,"On the streets of Dakar, Senegal, the two 7-footers stood out. They were spotted by employees of the Flying Star Academy, a Senegalese training ground for several basketball players who have ended up on college teams in the United States. The employees chased after the teenagers, imploring them to try their enormous hands at the sport.",[Follow our live coverage of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.],"At the time, Koumadje, now a 7-foot-4 senior at Florida State, preferred soccer. Fall, now a 7-foot-6 senior at Central Florida, was more interested in devouring anime and manga series like “Naruto” and “Tokyo Ghoul.” Both were, at first, indifferent to basketball.","But their potential upside was difficult to ignore. To onlookers, they evoked thoughts of the next Hakeem Olajuwon or Yao Ming.","Today, their size offers less promise. They toiled to become giant forces in the paint, only to watch as basketball evolved from a game that coveted height into a more freewheeling, 3-point-centric game that deems their skill sets nearly as obsolete as a fax machine: nice to have, but no longer entirely necessary.","“What’s interesting about both, their advanced analytics, they play off the charts — well over 1 point per possession, and that’s really effective in college basketball,” said Steve Kyler, the editor and publisher of Basketball Insiders, which produces weekly N.B.A. mock drafts. “When you dig deeper, in situational-type things they grade really well, but the truth of the matter is the N.B.A. game isn’t played that way anymore. It’s all about stretch 5s, quickness.”","“I think they may get a look on the fringe based off their size,” Kyler added. “But a guy 7-foot-6 being the first overall pick or top five is pretty rare now.”","In the college game, where height can still create a tangible advantage, Fall and Koumadje — who are among the tallest players currently in Division I — will be crucial cogs in their teams’ N.C.A.A. tournament performance.","Beyond that, whether they can find a place and purpose in the N.B.A. — where the only active players who stand 7-foot-3 or taller are Dallas’s Kristaps Porzingis, who has a far more diverse skill set, and Philadelphia’s Boban Marjanovic — remains to be seen.","“Extending my range is something I definitely want to work on,” said Fall, who helped the Knights earn their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 2005 by averaging nearly 11 points and 7 rebounds a game. “I’m not going to go out there and shoot 3s like a lot of bigs do now, but pick my spots.","“But I feel like no matter how the game has changed, you still need somebody down low to do some damage.”","Basketball academies in Senegal like Flying Star now regularly send players abroad. After playing for a few months at the academy, Fall got a chance to join a high school team in the United States. His mother reluctantly let her son go, hoping he would receive a better education.","Extremely raw when he arrived at Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Fla., Fall almost quit basketball. But he refined his game while playing on a travel team alongside Ben Simmons, now with the Philadelphia 76ers. Fall also trained in Houston with Olajuwon, a Hall of Famer who emphasized the importance of footwork for a center his size.","Occasionally, Fall watched Simmons at nearby Montverde Academy, where Koumadje landed after coming to the United States. Fall and Koumadje only briefly overlapped in Dakar — Koumadje is originally from Chad — but in high school they talked on the phone or via Facebook. Their discussions rarely veered into basketball. Instead, they commiserated about the difficulties of adjusting to life when you are over 7 feet tall and 4,500 miles from home.","Koumadje, like Fall, grasps the unlikelihood that he will develop into a free-shooting N.B.A. big man. Before his senior year in high school, he played pickup games at the University of Southern California with Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons. It was then, Koumadje said, that he realized he was more effective cemented in the post.","“The game is evolving and that’s what people want,” said Koumadje, a two-year starter who led the Seminoles in blocked shots this season. “But I play to my strength. That’s what I do.”","Fall’s turning point came after his sophomore season at Central Florida, when he contemplated entering the 2017 N.B.A. draft. Five teams told him he needed vast improvement adapting to the speed of the pros, particularly in guarding pick-and-rolls.","Central Florida Coach Johnny Dawkins — a former Duke guard who played with the towering centers Shawn Bradley and Manute Bol in the N.B.A. — was hired before Fall’s sophomore year, and created a three-year plan for him. Increasing mobility and stamina came first, followed by catching the ball down low and learning to work out of double and triple teams. This season, Dawkins has moved Fall farther out on the perimeter defensively.","Wherever he stands, Fall often forces opposing players to elevate more when they shoot, to get the ball over his arms.","“Our floaters have to be a little bit higher, and it probably screwed a couple of guys up,” Fran Dunphy, Temple’s coach at the time, said after a game against Central Florida on March 9.","Teams have tried less inventive strategies to bypass Fall’s 8-foot-4 wingspan. Fall, who is bulkier than Bol or Bradley, said that he had heard opposing coaches tell players to go after his knees.",Though he is all but assured of breaking the Division I record for career field-goal percentage — he currently shoots over 74 percent; the record is 67.8 — Fall converts only 36 percent of his free throws. Fall — whose hands are 10½ inches long — said that when he shoots free throws it feels as if he is holding a volleyball.,"His shooting form, which involves using only his right hand while flinging his left arm in the air and then slouching, has drawn derisive comments on social media, where he is sometimes treated as a sideshow. After Fall had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Houston that ended the Cougars' 33-game home winning streak, Fall got more attention for a GIF that showed him holding the ball over an opponent’s head like an older brother playing keep-away.","Fall and Koumadje are accustomed to stares in airports and snide remarks from opposing fans. While both harbor N.B.A. dreams — neither appears in most mock drafts — they also envision a life beyond basketball, when their height won’t dictate how others perceive them.","Koumadje said he would eventually like to work for the United Nations, helping refugees in Chad. Fall wants to become an engineer.","“Basketball’s opened a lot of doors for me, but there’s more to me than the ball, the hoop,” Fall said. “I definitely don’t want to be defined by that. I definitely don’t want to be seen as an attraction, either.”"
"No Playoffs for LeBron James, No Job for Magic Johnson. Why the Lakers Fell Apart. - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES — Hours after Magic Johnson abruptly resigned as the Los Angeles Lakers’ president of basketball operations, and mere minutes after LeBron James’s first season as the franchise cornerstone ended with a buzzer-beating loss, James left Staples Center on Tuesday night without speaking to reporters, trailed only by security officers and questions about the team’s future.","It was not the season anyone envisioned for the Lakers, who had upended the N.B.A. by signing James last summer with the hype and expectation of returning the franchise to its glory years. One of the most storied teams in the league, the Lakers have not won a championship in nine years, and Los Angeles is frustrated, hungry and impatient.","Instead, the team collected nearly as many injuries as losses. James, who will miss the N.B.A. playoffs beginning Saturday for the first time in 14 years, watched the final six games of the season from the bench as the team looked to preserve him for next season. His next buzzy stop is a studio lot as the star of “Space Jam 2,” which he has said is set to begin filming this summer.","For the Lakers (37-45), all the drama was off the court, right up to the end, with Johnson’s abrupt announcement so out-of-the-blue that he had not even told his boss, the team owner Jeanie Buss, before wading into a gaggle of reporters.",[Here is a look at Magic Johnson’s biggest moments as team president.],"On Wednesday morning, Johnson, 59, wrote on Twitter that he considers himself a “Laker for life.”",He announced in 1991 that he was H.I.V. positive but said Tuesday that he was in good health and it was not a factor in his decision.,"Johnson had sealed a $154 million, four-year deal for James — two greats fulfilling their needs: Johnson to restore luster to a glamorous team; James to close out his career as a Laker and develop his business and entertainment interests centered on Hollywood.",And now they both left Staples Center with a losing record and a team in chaos.,"In some ways, it was the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunction.","So there was the coach, Luke Walton, saying what losing coaches always say: essentially, wait until next year. His job may have been saved when Johnson quit, but he would not talk about that.","“We have a lot of time to work and get better,” Walton said late Tuesday after the Lakers’ loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. “Let’s organize and prioritize what we need to do so we can give ourselves a better chance next season.”","It was a wasted season for everyone involved, and James is as polarizing as ever, even in Los Angeles, where as much as fans banked on him, they also retained a degree of skepticism that this was all real.","Jonas Never, a prominent Los Angeles-based street artist, found that out the hard way.","“Honestly,” Never said in a telephone interview, “Lakers fans are the trickiest.”","Last July, he had talked a restaurant owner in Venice Beach into allowing him to paint a mural of James in a Lakers jersey to commemorate his arrival: 75 cans of spray paint in 12 hours for the “King of L.A.”","It did not take long for the mural to be vandalized — not just once, but twice in a span of four days. The first time, it was salvageable. Someone had defaced the wall with the words “We Don’t Want You” and “No King,” along with “3-6,” a reference to James’s losing record in the N.B.A. finals. But Never was able to restore the mural. (“A two-minute fix,” he said.)","The second time, someone splashed yellow paint all over James’s face, and Never had no choice but to paint over it.","“If it had been a car, it would have been totaled,” he said.","To be fair, most fans were excited about James. The news media coverage was breathless. And perhaps no member of the ticket-paying public had invested more in LeBron-to-L.A. than Jacob Emrani, a personal injury lawyer from Beverly Hills, Calif., who had purchased space for 40 James-themed billboards in the run-up to free agency.","“I definitely didn’t think it was going to be something where we missed the playoffs or thought, ‘What the hell is happening here?’ ” Emrani said in an interview. “I’m disappointed in the breaks we got, but I’m not necessarily disappointed in LeBron. We were in fourth place when he went down.”","Emrani was referring to what may have been the season’s turning point: the Lakers’ ill-fated Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors, which James himself cited in a recent interview with Spectrum SportsNet, the Lakers’ broadcast partner. The Lakers were playing solid basketball at the time — in fact, they clobbered the Warriors to improve their record to 20-14 — but James injured his groin in the third quarter and wound up missing the next 17 games. The Lakers went into a tailspin without him.","“Disappointed in my body,” James told Spectrum SportsNet, adding: “Because I knew exactly where we were at that point. And we just were never able to get back from that.”","Once James returned, the team’s front office unsuccessfully tried to engineer a trade for another big star, the New Orleans Pelicans’ Anthony Davis — this, after James had told ESPN that it would be “amazing” to play alongside Davis.",The plan appeared to be to essentially trade away the rest of the team. The fallout was clear: Whatever fragile bonds that remained in the home locker room at Staples Center seemed to fray at the seams.,"For many fans, it was impossible to dissociate James from the failed trade — James and Davis share an agent, Rich Paul — and much of the mess that followed.","“Nearly everyone on the roster was involved in those trade rumors,” Never said. “How can you really feel wanted if you think you’re going to be packing your locker the next day?”","As the losses mounted, so did the criticisms of James: that he appeared detached from his teammates, that basketball was secondary to his growing interest in his entertainment company, that his body was finally breaking down after so many years of athletic genius, that he was no longer capable of carrying a team to a title.","But in the 55 games that James did play this season, he was pretty good. He averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists a game while shooting 51 percent from the field. Besides, a long summer may benefit him after so many extended playoff runs.","“The only thing that was hard was that he got hurt,” Walton said late Tuesday night. “It takes time to build a relationship with somebody. But as our relationship grew and I got to see what it was like coaching him, it was great. And I believe if we could have stayed healthy, we would have had a very successful season. He’s an incredible player.”","For his part, James told Spectrum SportsNet that he wanted to use the summer to get his body back to “120 percent” ahead of training camp — even as he moonlights on the set of “Space Jam 2.” He has been adamant that his work in entertainment will not interfere with his work on the basketball court.","The question is whether one bad season will become two. So much hinges on the summer as the Lakers look to add another star to their roster. (Emrani said he had plans for more billboards, though he declined to say which top-tier free agents he would target.) James has said that he will be as involved in the team’s recruiting efforts as possible.","“I’m looking forward to seeing who jumps in the car with me and wants to take this ride to the top,” James said in his interview with Spectrum SportsNet. “I know what I bring to the game. I know my commitment to the game. I’ve never cheated the game, and throughout my career, it’s always given back to me.”","Back in Venice Beach, Never painted a new mural during the middle of the N.F.L. season, replacing LeBron James with Derwin James, a safety for the Los Angeles Chargers. The mural has been up for months, Never said, and no one has touched it."
"Are Kyrie Irving and the Celtics on the Cusp of Winning, or Losing? No One Can Tell - The New York Times",SACRAMENTO — The Boston Celtics were not in a good place when they boarded a plane bound for California on Sunday. They were coming off a home loss to the Houston Rockets that point guard Kyrie Irving punctuated by using a total of 43 words to answer nine questions in his postgame news conference.,"At one point, he was asked whether he thought the team could cobble together some momentum on its West Coast trip.","“We’ll see,” he whispered.","Just one season removed from a run to the N.B.A.’s Eastern Conference finals, and seemingly improved by the re-addition of Gordon Hayward and the continued development of their young core, the Celtics were on the brink of falling apart. Any hope they still harbored of being a championship-ready team was as brittle as a toothpick.","But after some reflection and conversation, the Celtics regained a bit of their swagger with back-to-back wins this week against the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. The Celtics will see if they can keep the good vibes going on Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers, which is anything but certain, especially for Irving, whose season has been clouded by questions about his future with the team.",Such uncertainty does not make Irving unique in the modern N.B.A. — Kevin Durant of the Warriors and Kawhi Leonard of the Toronto Raptors are among the other stars who will weigh big decisions in free agency this summer — but the Celtics have let the noise affect them.,"With the two wins this week improving their record to 40-26, the Celtics may be showing signs that they are finally, mercifully, learning how to cope.","“That long plane ride helped us out,” Irving said after Tuesday’s lopsided victory over the Warriors. “I’ll just say that. We needed it. We needed it. We were going to get to a point where we were just going to get tired of fighting each other, fighting the outside world when it doesn’t really matter. So we just wanted to come out here and play basketball.","“This is our sanctuary, and we have to do everything we can to protect it. We can’t let anyone infiltrate it.”","Irving, who missed Wednesday’s win against the Kings with a left thigh contusion, is averaging a team-leading 23.4 points a game along with 7 assists and 4.9 rebounds, both career highs. He is also shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from 3-point range.","He also ranks among the N.B.A. leaders in mercurial behavior. He has been vague about the specific source of his discontent, but it may have something to do with his pending free agency.","Irving backed off an earlier pledge to re-sign with the Celtics after they struggled at the start of the season. In fact, during a trip to New York to play the Knicks on Feb. 1, he told a group of reporters in his own colorfully abrasive way that he did not owe anyone anything. The Knicks, of course, would be interested in signing Irving, a six-time All-Star who grew up in New Jersey and has a soft spot for Madison Square Garden.","Then came the All-Star break, and a clip of Irving and Durant having an inaudible conversation found its way to the internet, where an army of amateur lip readers tried to decode what they were saying. Worth noting: Irving and Durant are close friends. Also worth noting: The Knicks will have enough cap space this summer for two max contracts.","Irving refused to shed light on their chat, and said it was nobody’s business, which was his prerogative. But it had the general effect of using a napkin to mop up an oil spill.","Since then, Irving has been alluding to nefarious forces and the steep cost of celebrity, saying he hates the spotlight — even as he sells sneakers and moonlights as an actor. He reiterated his disdain this week after collecting 19 points and 11 assists against the Warriors, his 17th double-double this season.","“The business part of it is just what makes it terrible for me — honestly, dealing with all this,” he said, referring to the reporters around him. “I’m going to be honest with you guys: The basketball part of it? I have to keep that fun. That’s where I’m great. Being around my teammates, that’s what makes me happy. And the business part of it is going to be business.”",It was not lost on anyone who witnessed this exchange that Irving was bashing the business of basketball while wearing an Uncle Drew ball cap — the same Uncle Drew character he popularized in soft drink commercials and then parlayed into a movie released last year.,"As for the basketball itself, well, Boston has had an uneven season, the product of a team that is not nearly Lakers-level dysfunctional but is not exactly cohesive, either. The Celtics arrived for their game against the Warriors having lost five of their last six games, and their locker room was a joyless place.","Perhaps they needed to get away from Boston. Perhaps they needed perspective. Perhaps Irving needed to speak with Danny Ainge, the team’s president of basketball operations, and Brad Stevens, its coach, who reminded Irving that the team still had a lot of season left to play. It was not over, not yet, not by any stretch.","“Every team has to find a togetherness in competing,” Stevens said. “Some teams, it takes 60 games. Some teams, it takes 20 games. And bad teams never get there. We hope that it took us 60 games, but we’ll see. We haven’t proven ourselves to be great at that yet for a long stretch of time.”","In their 128-95 win against the Warriors, the Celtics had 38 assists on 49 field goals. They also communicated. When Irving and forward Jaylen Brown botched a play that led to an early turnover, Brown patted himself on the chest to apologize, then appeared to apologize a second time on their next trip up the court.","The next night, in Sacramento, Irving sat behind the visiting bench for the Celtics’ 111-109 victory over the Kings. He was vocal. He did a lot of fist-pumping. And he celebrated when Hayward, less than 24 hours after scoring 30 points against the Warriors, connected on the game-winner.","After suffering a grisly ankle injury in the opening game and missing last season, Hayward has struggled to find a rhythm in his return. Maybe he found it here in California, along with the rest of the team. The Celtics are too talented to let this opportunity go to waste, because who knows how long it will last?","“As long as my teammates are feeling good,” Irving said, “then we’re in a good place.”"
"Dwyane Wade Bows Out: Once, Again and Always a Heat Player - The New York Times","The crush of bodies surrounding Dwyane Wade as he left an N.B.A. court for the last time as an active player had the effect of a small tidal wave, surging through the jammed Barclays Center tunnel, head-on into a pack of waiting well-wishers.","At the rear of the crowd stood Pat Riley, who brought Wade to Miami 16 years ago, nurtured him to stardom, celebrated three championships with him, let him get away in 2016 over a contract dispute and less than two years later welcomed him home with open arms.","“Whoa,” Riley said, hands on the shoulders of his wife, Chris, steadying her against the swell of humanity.","Now here, finally, came Wade, man of the hour. Wade and Riley, both standing 6 feet 4 inches, made eye contact. Riley raised his right arm forward. Wade reached above the security detail, clasping his hand with the team president’s. The linchpins of the Miami Heat franchise pulled together for a heartfelt embrace.","“One more,” Riley told Wade. “I’ve got a max contract for you.”","Wade snickered. Riley chortled. It was the self-mocking joke Riley could tell and they both could enjoy after Wade, having gone home again following unfulfilling detours to Chicago and Cleveland, was given the send-off he deserved.","After being traded back to Miami by the Cavaliers early last year, Wade talked himself into a last dance for the 2018-19 season, many nights of which he played younger than his well-worn 37 years. Properly feted before Miami’s home schedule closeout on Tuesday night, he scored 30 points in a victory over Philadelphia and topped it off with a playful triple double (25 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists) as the Heat’s season ended 24 hours later with a 113-94 defeat to the playoff-bound Nets.","“I can retire and be happy about my career,” Wade would say, sporting a gold and black jacket in the interview room, on his way out to dance the night away with a guest list that included his N.B.A. “brotherhood” — LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul.","However dapper at 74, with a fine head of combed-back gray hair, Riley was never part of that social scene, just the patriarch who landed Wade with the fifth pick of the 2003 draft, considered at the time to be a consolation prize after James, Darko Milicic, Anthony and Chris Bosh were the first four players chosen.","But Wade was more special than anyone imagined during his time at Marquette, a world-class gymnast in basketball footwear, with the uncommon calm of a cocksure gunslinger.","When Wade had moved on into the corridor leading to the locker room, I told Riley about a 2005 playoff night in Auburn Hills, Mich., when Wade, as a second-year player, was making life quite difficult for the defending champion, defensively stout Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals.","Taking a halftime stroll, I ran into Chuck Daly, who as the Pistons coach in the late 1980s had devised a defense specifically for Michael Jordan — the famous Jordan Rules.","“I’ll tell you what, he’s got some Jordan in him,” Daly said, dragging on a cigarette, when I asked what he thought of the young Wade. “He’s got all the things you can’t teach.”","Riley nodded. “Chuck was right,” he said.","Wade had other elite qualities besides the balletic ability to score from angles we couldn’t be sure actually existed. He could pass like a point guard when his team needed an assist. He was a solid team defender. He retires as the most productive shot-blocking guard in N.B.A. history, having last month nudged past Jordan.","Flashy as he was, Wade had some Tim Duncan in him, too. Until James arrived with Bosh in the summer of 2010, he was unquestionably the franchise star without having to broadcast it to the world, and his door was open to anyone who could give him a better chance to win.","Wade embraced Riley’s 2004 acquisition of Shaquille O’Neal when Kobe Bryant wanted no part of the big fella in Los Angeles. He recruited James while fully aware of how the self-proclaimed King was great at basketball, as well as sucking the oxygen out of an organization.","When James departed after two titles and four consecutive runs to the finals, Riley called it the most devastating blow of his time in Miami, but Wade insisted there were no hard feelings. It was business. He was still being paid to play basketball, live in Miami. How could life not be good?","Yet he wasn’t immune to wounded pride when Riley refused to give him a third contract year in 2016, citing Wade’s balky knees and declining stats. Wade left, reluctantly, one more divorce in a league of ever-transient stars.","There’s nothing wrong, nothing at all, with players maximizing free agency, leveraging their way to whichever location suits them at a certain career stage. James of course has been the pied piper of the paradigm. Kevin Durant is reportedly poised to again follow his lead, right out of Golden State.","But James’s presence in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, a convenient excuse to avoiding dealing with Magic Johnson’s sudden, stunning disappearance from the Lakers’ front office, was a reminder that the more moves a player makes, the better the odds he might eventually outmaneuver himself.","Meanwhile, Dirk Nowitzki, like Wade, was also demonstrating the currency in continuity, finishing a 21-year run Wednesday night with the Dallas Mavericks to widespread acclaim. Manu Ginobili and Duncan were similarly deified for staying the course in San Antonio. Wade will remain the toast of South Florida.","In the Miami locker room, a few young Heat players lined up for Wade to sign their jerseys and sneakers. The No. 3 jersey he wore was given to Anthony, a shooter without a squad after parting ways with Paul’s Houston Rockets this season after a mere 10 games.","Anthony did manage to scoop up a ball rolling out of bounds in the fourth quarter by the corner front row from where he, Paul and James were cheering on Wade. He took one dribble and, thankfully, resisted the temptation.","“I didn’t get a chance to play against Melo this season and exchange jerseys,” said Wade, explaining the gesture. “He was the missing piece.”","Throughout his career, wherever he lit up the scoreboard, Anthony seemed to miss the point, unwilling to — as former President Barack Obama said of Wade in a video tribute — “sometimes sacrifice your ego in pursuit of a title.”","If Anthony never plays again in the N.B.A., is there a moral to their divergent stories? Only if the most graceful departure possible is a priority, part of the plan. It apparently was for Wade. He left with a self-assured smile and, while indicating he would probably need therapy to deal with the time on his hands, he ruled out a potential return.","“I think everybody knows this is for real,” he said."
DeMarcus Cousins and the Golden State Soap Opera - The New York Times,"HOUSTON — DeMarcus Cousins used to watch soap operas with his grandmother when he was growing up. She would refer to them as her “stories,” he said, and “As the World Turns” was her favorite. Cousins could never fully relate to the absurd drama of his grandmother’s stories until this season, when he joined the Golden State Warriors.","“Every episode it was something,” he said. “And that’s what this has turned into.”","Cousins is sometimes an innocent bystander. (Consider the midseason beef between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green that stemmed from a late-game meltdown against the Los Angeles Clippers and bled into Durant’s impending free agency.) But sometimes Cousins is involved, even if it is not his choice. He was aware, for example, before Wednesday’s game against the Houston Rockets, that members of the news media and the general public were picking apart his defense and referring to him as a liability.","“We all been in this business long enough to know how it goes,” said Cousins, a 6-foot-11 center. “And I’ve been around this team to know how things go around here. You’re always looking for something to make a story. I mean, I could care less. You all got to do your jobs, and I got to do mine.”","For all the laments about Cousins’s vulnerability in pick-and-roll defensive situations, there is no denying his offensive impact when he is focused, and he was supremely focused against the Rockets on Wednesday night, collecting 27 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 106-104 victory that infused the team with some positive vibes.","Scoring down low, passing out of the post, setting meaty screens — Cousins does things that the Warriors have seldom featured in their four-plus seasons of dominance.","“For as long as we can remember, we haven’t had a guy we can just throw the ball to in the post and work around him,” Stephen Curry said.","It is still a process, of course, both for the Warriors, who are working to incorporate another mammoth personality into their fold as they pursue a third straight championship, and for Cousins, a four-time All-Star who spent the first few months of the season building strength and working on his conditioning as he recovered from an Achilles’ tendon tear.","Since Cousins made his season debut on Jan. 18, the Warriors are 15-7. But they had lost six of their last 10 games entering Wednesday, and the general mood of the team felt flat. Curry likened it to when Durant joined the Warriors in 2016, and the team spent the first two or three months of the season trying to find its rhythm.","“There was a little sensitivity to how everybody was going to get their shots,” Curry said. “At the end of the day, we’re all talented and we all have high basketball I.Q.s, so just let things happen. You don’t have to force anything. We’ve been good at it at times, and not so good at other times. So it’s just a matter of sticking with the program.”","After sinking 11 of 16 shots against the Rockets, Cousins acknowledged that it was the best he had felt since he made his return.","“I think it’s coming,” Cousins said. “We’ve had stretches where it’s kind of flowing for everybody. But this is a team that’s been together for a while, and they’re used to playing a certain type of way. So for me to just come in — I’m not expecting this team to adjust to me. Obviously, I have to adjust to them.”","Durant missed the game with a sprained ankle, which meant that Cousins had more playmaking opportunities than usual. Coach Steve Kerr made some adjustments, too, staggering Cousins and Green for stretches so that each had more room to operate in the middle of the court. Kerr has also been advising his players to pump the brakes in transition.","“Sometimes we’ve played a little too fast and shot too many quick shots instead of letting him get down on the block and controlling things,” Kerr said, referring to Cousins. He added: “I think we’ve got to remind ourselves that this is still early in the process. We’re all learning. Me too. I’ve got to learn to use him better.”","If Cousins still appears to labor at times (or most of the time) to get overly airborne, his confidence seems fine.","“I don’t think anyone can stop me one on one, period,” he said. “So you can put whoever you want on me.”","The Warriors and the Rockets have history. In last season’s Western Conference finals, Houston had a 3-2 series lead against Golden State, but Chris Paul injured his hamstring in Game 5. The Rockets lost the final two games of the series without him, and the Warriors went on to successfully defend their N.B.A. championship.","Cousins was not involved in that series, but he is a part of the dynamic now — and the Warriors are not quite finished preparing themselves for the postseason. Andrew Bogut, a defense-minded center who last played for Golden State in 2016, is expected to join the team in the coming days after an M.V.P. season with the Sydney Kings of Australia’s National Basketball League. Kerr recently described Bogut as “an insurance policy in the frontcourt.”","Yes, the league’s most compelling drama is about to welcome the return of a former cast member. For his part, Cousins said he would continue to focus on the only role he knows.","“I just want to play basketball,” he said."
"Kenny Anderson, the Former N.B.A. Star, Is Recovering After a Stroke - The New York Times","Kenny Anderson, a celebrated point guard from Queens who had a 14-year N.B.A. career, was hospitalized over the weekend after suffering a stroke.","Lina Catalfamo Plath, a family spokeswoman, said via email that Anderson was recovering. Plath also released a statement from Anderson’s wife, Natasha.","“We would like to thank everyone for reaching out on behalf of Kenny,” Natasha Anderson said in the statement. “Our family is extremely grateful for all the prayers and love that we have received over the last few days. We appreciate you continuing to respect our privacy as Kenny heals.”","Anderson, 48, recently concluded his first season as the men’s basketball coach at Fisk University, a historically black school in Nashville that plays at the N.A.I.A. level.","As a high school player at Archbishop Molloy, a powerhouse program in Queens, Anderson was one of the most prolific and high-profile players in the city’s rich basketball history. A McDonald’s All-American, Anderson set what was then a state scoring record with 2,621 points before enrolling at Georgia Tech, where he helped the team reach the Final Four in 1990.","After Anderson spent two seasons at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the second overall pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft — Larry Johnson went first to the Charlotte Hornets — and Anderson enjoyed a productive career that never quite lived up to the hype that had followed him since he was a teenager. He averaged 12.6 points and 6.1 assists a game while playing for nine teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Portland Trail Blazers, and was an All-Star selection for the Nets in 1994.","A 2017 documentary on Anderson called “Mr. Chibbs” detailed many of his personal struggles, including bankruptcy and depression. In 2014, he traveled to North Korea as a member of the team that Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls forward, cobbled together at the invitation of Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader.","“My mistakes weren’t really mistakes,” Anderson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. “It was being young and living and learning. Yes, I spent a lot of money; I went through a lot of money. I had some failed marriages — if you want to criticize me for that. You can’t cry about your mishaps. I count my blessings, I don’t count my mishaps.”"
"Mike Bibby, a Former N.B.A. Star, Is Accused of Sexually Assaulting a Teacher - The New York Times","Mike Bibby, the former N.B.A. player, is being investigated by the police over accusations of sexual abuse.","Mr. Bibby, now a high school basketball coach in Arizona, was accused by a teacher who works at the same school, The Arizona Republic reported. The episode that prompted the accusations was said to have taken place in 2017.","The Republic, citing a restraining order granted last week, said that Mr. Bibby had been accused of grabbing the teacher by the waist and pulling her into a car, then groping her and rubbing his genitals on her. After the woman left the car, the order said, he followed her and made sexual remarks. The woman said she did not know Mr. Bibby before the incident.","The restraining order quoted the teacher as saying she was “in shock, in fear, intimidated by his actions, afraid of him as he smelled of alcohol.”",A lawyer for Mr. Bibby denied the accusations.,"“I can say with pretty much certainty this alleged incident didn’t happen and that will be shown down the road,” Donald Harris, Mr. Bibby’s lawyer, told The Republic. “Michael Bibby did not participate in a sexual assault of any way, shape or form that was alleged by this lady two years ago.”","Mr. Bibby recently coached the boys’ basketball team to a fourth straight state championship at the school, Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix. He is also an alumnus of Shadow Mountain, and won a state championship as a player in the 1990s before attending the University of Arizona, where he won a national championship in 1997. He retired from the N.B.A. in 2012 after a 14-year career with six teams, most notably the Vancouver Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks. He spent his last season with the Knicks, playing 39 games after signing as a free agent in December 2011.","For the past two summers, Mr. Bibby, 40, played with the Ghost Ballers of the Big3, a professional 3-on-3 basketball league founded by the rapper Ice Cube."
Those Denver Upstarts Save Their Season Thanks to Jamal Murray - The New York Times,DENVER — There was a time not long ago that basketball success in the Rocky Mountains was measured by the Denver Nuggets’ ability to persuade a free agent of Dwyane Wade’s stature to meet team brass in New York and let the Nuggets offer him millions.,"In the summer of 2016, only one season into the career of Nikola Jokic and with few hints to that point that the Nuggets already had a cornerstone player, just getting the opportunity to pitch Wade face-to-face was widely hailed as a triumph for this franchise.","What went unrevealed that off-season is that Denver also made a futile run at Wade’s longtime rival, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks. Nowitzki had no interest in even entertaining the idea of leaving the only team he had ever known, but that was the Nuggets in the embryonic stages of Jokic’s development — straining to persuade some of the game’s biggest names to take them seriously.","Three years later, Jokic is a certifiable All-Star and his team of upstarts from the Mile High City found an entertaining way on Tuesday night to win some leaguewide notice. Seemingly headed for a second consecutive playoff defeat to the San Antonio Spurs on its home floor, Denver rode a remarkable fourth-quarter resurrection from the third-year guard Jamal Murray to rally to a 114-105 victory over the Spurs that did far more than even this Western Conference first-round series at one game apiece.","“Definitely saved the season,” Paul Millsap, Denver’s veteran forward, said in a quiet moment at his locker. “To go down, 0-2, against the San Antonio Spurs, going into their place, it’s a massacre waiting to happen.”","Millsap’s candor conveyed a good chunk of the significance attached to this win, but not all of it. Murray’s eruption for 21 of his 24 points in the final period — on 8-for-9 shooting after he stood at 0-for-8 through three quarters — not only gave the hosts hope of making this an actual series but also spared them some real embarrassment and introspection.","After five consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, Denver unexpectedly won 54 games this season to vault to No. 2 in the West. The Nuggets were nonetheless a trendy pick to suffer a first-round upset against the San Antonio masters of execution and their coaching maestro, Gregg Popovich, which would naturally render Denver’s regular-season accomplishments rather hollow.","“Frauds” was the popular word being tossed around on N.B.A. Twitter after the Nuggets fell behind by 19 points — twice — in a must-win game. Booing broke out at Pepsi Center on multiple occasions in just Denver’s second home playoff game since 2013, with both Jokic and Nuggets Coach Michael Malone telling reporters afterward that the fans were too hard on Will Barton when they hissed at his 1-for-10 shooting.","“When they’re going through a tough time, they could use some love,” Malone said of his players, who comprise the league’s youngest playoff roster.","Fortunately for Barton and the rest of the Nuggets, it was all love in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to Murray, who shot 8-for-24 in Game 1 — including a wide-open elbow jumper he clanked in crunchtime that clearly haunted the Canadian guard well into Game 2.","During one key timeout, Malone reminded his players “what the Clippers did” Monday night, when they rallied out of a 31-point deficit in the second half at Golden State to register the largest playoff comeback in N.B.A. history. The inspiration finally hit Murray in the fourth when, without warning, he drained his first eight shots.","In support of Murray, Jokic rang up 21 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists in a bid for a second consecutive triple-double, which would suggest that the Serbian big man is coping quite well with his first turn under a playoff microscope. Gary Harris and Millsap added 23 and 20 points, to give Denver four starters in the 20s.","“We gave up 38 points in the fourth quarter,” said a seething Popovich. “End of story.”","The collapse was even worse than Popovich realized. The Spurs actually allowed 39 points in the quarter — and San Antonio’s All-Star forward, LaMarcus Aldridge, could be subjected to some league discipline that affects his status for Thursday night’s Game 3 judging by video footage in circulation that appears to show Aldridge landing a below-the-belt shot on Harris.","Not that the Nuggets, after days of hearing incessantly about how inexperienced they are, can feel any sort of comfort yet. They’ve lost 13 consecutive games in San Antonio dating to 2012. Denver is also 0-11, as a franchise, in best-of-seven series after losing Game 1.","“I think the cynicism is fair,” Nuggets General Manager Tim Connelly said after the victory, acknowledging that he was well aware of the noise about his team.","Yet Connelly pointed out that as fluky as skeptics might find the Nuggets’ No. 2 seed, team officials set three fairly lofty goals before the season started. Then they watched this group, largely assembled through Denver’s own shrewd drafting and trading, reach them all.",End the playoff drought? Check.,Win the Northwest Division? Check.,Secure a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round of the postseason?,Check.,"The next step was making sure they didn’t spoil all that by falling into an 0-2 hole to San Antonio with two home defeats, which is the sort of deficit only four teams in league history have managed to erase. Yet one of the more refreshing things about this team is that it doesn’t try to pretend that its collective lack of postseason experience is merely a topic harped on by the news media.","The Nuggets have only three players (Millsap, Barton and Mason Plumlee) who appeared in a playoff game before Game 1 of this series, and they acknowledge it’s an obstacle, especially against a team that can carry out a game plan like the Spurs.","“Yes, playoff basketball is everything everybody says it is,” Harris told me Monday, on the eve of Game 2.","Breakthrough performances from Murray and Jokic and big comebacks, as such, must be celebrated — even at this early stage of Round 1.","So in the middle of the victorious locker room, swept up in what the novices, er, the Nuggets had just achieved, Malone was duly pulled into a robust group hug by their rarely seen owner, Stan Kroenke, and Kroenke’s son Josh, the team’s president and governor.","“It was fun,” Connelly said, “to watch some young guys grow up tonight.”"
"Cal Ramsey, Knicks Broadcaster and Community Representative, Dies at 81 - The New York Times","Cal Ramsey, a presence on the New York basketball scene for more than a half-century, who starred at New York University in the 1950s, played briefly for the Knicks and remained with them as a longtime broadcaster and community relations representative, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 81.","The Knicks announced his death, at a rehabilitation center. He had been in poor health in recent years.","Ramsey, who had lived in Harlem since he was young, began honing his skills on the playground courts of the Rucker League, which has attracted some of the game’s greatest players over the years.","He first appeared at Madison Square Garden while playing for Commerce High School of Manhattan. He played at the Garden for three seasons as a forward at N.Y.U., where he was a teammate of the future Boston Celtic forward Tom Sanders. He is 11th on the leading scorers list for N.Y.U. with 1,275 points.","Ramsey was selected in the second round of the 1959 N.B.A. draft by the St. Louis Hawks. At 6 feet 4 inches, he was an outstanding rebounder with a good shooting touch, but he came to be considered too small as a forward and not good enough as a dribbler to excel at guard.","He played in only four games with the Hawks and seven with the Knicks in the 1959-60 season, then in two games with the Syracuse Nationals, the forerunners of the Philadelphia 76ers, in 1960-61.","Ramsey may have faced another obstacle in the N.B.A. that had little to do with his skills. “I’ve been told at the time there was a quota system in the league,” in which teams “may have wanted only two or three blacks,” Ramsey told Charles Salzberg for the oral history “From Set Shot to Slam Dunk” (1987).","After Ramsey’s stint with Syracuse, he went to the semipro Eastern League but incurred a severe knee injury in his third season with the circuit. It ended his playing career.","Ramsey was born on July 13, 1937, in Selma, Ala. He was a teacher in New York after his playing days, having received a bachelor’s degree from N.Y.U.","He was a color analyst for Knicks broadcasts from 1972 to 1982, then rejoined the team as a community representative in 1991. He was also an assistant basketball coach at N.Y.U., which had become a Division III team, from 1983 until the past season. He served N.Y.U. as assistant director of community relations for 20 years and received the N.Y.U. President’s Alumni Achievement Award in 2004.",Information on his survivors was not immediately available.,"James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, said in a statement that Ramsey “will be remembered for the thousands of young lives he influenced as a community leader.”","A case in point involved Al Barden, who, after starring for Boys High School in Brooklyn (now Boys and Girls), was recruited to N.Y.U. by Ramsey while he was playing there.","“Al was a tough kid with a habit of getting into some trouble,” Ramsey told Harvey Araton of The New York Times in 2009. “So I stayed on him, made sure he was going to class, doing the things he needed to stay eligible.”","When Barden’s basketball career was over, Ramsey, mindful of the problems athletes have in transitioning to a new phase of life, hired Barden as his replacement to direct a high school program for at-risk students. They remained friends through the years.","One day, Barden, living in California, phoned Ramsey to tell him of the birth of his son, whom he had named Ramses, ostensibly for the pharaohs of ancient Egypt as a symbol of everlasting strength.",But there was more to it than that.,“Replace the ‘s’ with a ‘y’ and what does it spell?” Barden asked Ramsey. “I really named him for you.”,"In June 2009, the Giants selected Ramses Barden, a receiver from Cal Poly, in the third round of the N.F.L. draft, and he spent four seasons with them.","When Ramses was drafted, Al Barden, speaking to The Times, said of Cal Ramsey, “He could get you to do anything just because of who he was: someone you just had to respect.”"
"The Nets Are Looking Really Good, Even From London - The New York Times","LONDON — In theory at least, we understand the words on the sports radio we hear incessantly — in taxis, at the fish and chips place, at the corner newsstand. But we are foreigners here and the stories are inscrutable, full of happenings from cricket ovals and rugby pitches.","Our sports focus is confined to our darkened living room, where my 7-year-old son, Leo, and I have lately been absorbing improbable happenings from the other side of the Atlantic — one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty Brooklyn Nets.","This has become our early-morning ritual. Wife and daughter still asleep, the boys watch the action from the night before, the scores carefully hidden from our N.B.A. League Pass app lest we ruin the ending.","We are basketball expatriates, two steps removed from the initial source of my N.B.A. obsession by a change of team loyalties and a move to London.","In our North London surroundings, we may as well be rooting for a badminton team from Bhutan. While the odd LeBron James jersey can be spotted, our Brooklyn Nets gear seemingly fades into the sea of Yankees caps brought home by tourists returning from New York (oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this Mets fan) and the endless Brooklyn-related mumbo jumbo that now adorns T-shirts worldwide.",[Nets’ Run to the Playoffs Hits a Snag With Spencer Dinwiddie Injury],"While N.F.L. gear is a common sighting, owing to the constant staging of American football games here, N.B.A. basketball is largely invisible. One imagines this was unaltered by the recent showdown of two of the league’s most dreadful teams, the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, inside London’s unlovable O2 arena. (We did not attend, just as we do not take leisure trips to see the dentist.)","Our sports-related conversations with Britons tend to revolve around the astronomical ticket prices required to see Arsenal, the English Premier League soccer team Leo has decided that we love forever. Our Nets fandom is like membership in a secret society, whose disclosure would mark us as eccentric and produce puzzlement.","Even my Knick fan friends back in New York do not want to hear about the Nets via email. My only real communion comes via obscure Nets-related podcasts I listen to while washing the dishes. When Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe devoted perhaps 3 minutes of a recent pod to the Nets surge, I confess to feelings of pride and validation I can only liken to a U.F.O. conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer.",My embrace of the Nets began seven years ago when the Knicks — the only team I had ever rooted for — shunned a gift from the basketball gods by letting Jeremy Lin leave town. It was the final indignity after years of atrocious basketball. I dumped my Knicks season tickets and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my Brooklyn neighborhood.,"I did not do so lightly. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I saw abandoning a team as a serious breach of the tribal code. I disdained fans from other cities who rooted for two teams in the same sport. I was unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all: the bandwagon fan. (If that Steph Curry jersey you own was the first Warriors gear in your closet, yes, I’m talking about you.)","But I was hopping on no bandwagon. With the exception of a pair of distant trips to the N.B.A. finals, the New Jersey-turned-Brooklyn Nets were a pathetic franchise. I was living in Brooklyn. My father had grown up in Queens and traveled on a streetcar to watch the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. I was not abandoning my tribe. I was returning to it.","This is what I told myself as I began reading about the odd collection of players I was now rooting for, trying to divine the narrative that would make it real. I fought through a sense of exile in the slick, new Barclays Center, which was full of fans for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool Brooklyn food, the dancing during timeouts, and whatever fascinating things were happening on their phones.","Yes, it was a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff. The season tickets I bought the day the Knicks said goodbye to J-Lin put me in seats that were a 10-minute walk from my house in Prospect Heights. Madison Square Garden was a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowels of Penn Station.","Yet there was something about the Garden, even as the Dolan era yielded a lost decade of basketball. The crowd understood. Hustle plays drew appreciation in an arena that had revered Charles Oakley. The energy was electric.","In Brooklyn, the mostly mercenary fans got what we deserved: a team of past-their-prime castoffs imported by the bombastic Russian magnate, Mikhail Prokhorov, who had brought the franchise to Brooklyn. Vowing to spend whatever it took to eclipse the Knicks — a low bar — he built a bonfire of money at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic.","In came the wildly overpaid Joe Johnson, a seven-time All-Star. In came the mediocre Gerald Wallace in exchange for a first-round pick that Portland turned into Damian Lillard. The centerpiece was the sullen, out-of-shape Deron Williams who, in another lifetime, looked like the best point guard on earth, and whose passions no longer appeared to include basketball.","They fit uneasily around the likable 7-footer, Brook Lopez, whose sweet shooting came along with rebounding and defensive skills that seemed better suited for other pursuits, like calligraphy.","My history as a Knicks fan made the plan feel familiar. Win now, baby! The future was for losers. The oligarch was buying his way to competitiveness pronto. Leaving no doubt, the Nets soon traded every first-round pick until the sun dies for the remains of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.","When it all unraveled and the Nets descended into an unwatchable state, I hung in. You can not renounce the team of your life and then walk away from your new one because they are terrible. Real fandom is forged in suffering. Even when my family traded Brooklyn for London in 2016, we remained Nets fans.",This happily coincided with another development: The Nets bucked the conventional wisdom that New York fans will not accept rebuilding and embraced patience.,"Sean Marks, the general manager, somehow turned a collection of mostly indifferent veterans into a raffish crew of young, hungry players led by a first-time head coach, Kenny Atkinson. They run at a ferocious pace, share the ball with grace, and play with joy.","Since an excruciating eight-game losing streak, the Nets have won 18 of 23. Even from afar, we can tell that the intensity has changed at the Barclays, the Brooook-Lyyyyn chants filling our London living room.","And still, an intense New York team deserves better. Back for the holidays, I took Leo to see New Orleans and their marquee star, Anthony Davis, at Barclays. The place was packed with tourists who seemed intent on taking selfies and buying Brooklyn gear at the swag shop.",Whatever.,"On Saturday morning, we will sit on the couch in our pajamas, Leo and me, and see what happened against the now-hated, if pitiful, Knicks the night before.",Please don’t tell us who won.
L.S.U. Suspends Coach Over Reported Connection to Scandal - The New York Times,"Louisiana State suspended its head men’s basketball coach, Will Wade, on Friday — less than two weeks before the N.C.A.A. tournament is set to begin — after a report that Wade made damning remarks to a recruiting middleman on a phone call that was wiretapped as part of a federal corruption investigation.","Wade spoke with Christian Dawkins, who was convicted of fraud last year for his connection in a scheme to funnel money to the families of basketball recruits, in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. In the conversation, according to a report on Thursday by Yahoo Sports, Wade was heard boasting in colorful language that he had made a strong offer to one recruit but that he had not yet committed because someone else in his life was not getting “enough piece of the pie in the deal.”","A source with knowledge of the call, who declined to be identified because the trial is continuing, confirmed the report on Friday.",The No. 10 Tigers (25-5) are having their best season in decades and are considered shoo-ins for an N.C.A.A. tournament bid. They host Vanderbilt on Saturday night before next week’s Southeastern Conference tournament in Nashville.,"“All of us at L.S.U. share the obligation to protect the integrity of this institution,” said the university’s president, F. King Alexander, and its athletic director, Joe Alleva, in a statement. “As such, we have suspended Head Coach Will Wade indefinitely until such time as we can ensure full compliance with the N.C.A.A., as well as institutional policies and standards.”","Alexander and Alleva pledged full cooperation with the N.C.A.A. and said an assistant coach, Tony Benford, would be interim head coach.","When confronted with the report on Thursday by a local television station, Wade declined to comment.","Dawkins was convicted of fraud after a trial last year, alongside Jim Gatto, the former director of global sports marketing for Adidas, and Merl Code Jr., who had also worked for Adidas. After a yearslong investigation involving a cooperating witness, undercover agents and wiretaps, prosecutors said the men had conspired to funnel Adidas money to the family of a top basketball player who would play for Louisville, one of the most prominent teams the apparel giant sponsors.","But prosecutors also accused Dawkins and Code of involvement in bribing assistant coaches at top programs. In a trial set to begin next month, three assistant coaches have pleaded guilty, but Dawkins and Code are also defendants and, following sentencing in the first trial on Tuesday, their lawyers pledged to fight prosecutors on the facts and summon college coaches to testify.","When the charges were first announced, in September 2017, they swiftly led to the firings of Louisville’s athletic director and Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino. Several assistant coaches charged also lost their jobs. Arizona Coach Sean Miller was suspended for a game after a report that he was on tape discussing with Dawkins the payment of $100,000 to a top recruit, but he and the university denied the charge and he was reinstated. Evidence at last year’s trial indicated that Miller did have phone calls with Dawkins.","“The information in recent news reports is very disturbing, if true,” the SEC commissioner, Greg Sankey, said in a statement on Friday. “Considering the existing circumstances, L.S.U. has taken appropriate action today while the investigation continues.”"
"N.B.A. Photographers ‘Do It for the Gram,’ Too - The New York Times","Nathaniel Butler has been an N.B.A. senior photographer since 1984. Those were the days of shooting on film and developing photos in hotel rooms after games. Today, players text Butler as they arrive at the arena so he can be in position to capture a perfect arena entrance shot for them to post on Instagram.",The job isn’t what it used to be.,"When Andrew D. Bernstein became an official N.B.A. photographer in 1986, he was continually thwarted in his attempts to get his camera into in-game huddles to capture the interactions between players and coaches. Pat Riley, who was the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, made sure to obscure all viewpoints.","Halfway through the season, Riley asked Bernstein why he wanted to be in the huddle. People want to see what’s happening on the inside, Bernstein told Riley, who agreed to give Bernstein a chance. If you screw up, Riley said, you are never coming back.","More than three decades later, Bernstein is still photographing N.B.A. players, huddles and pretty much whatever he pleases as the league’s longest tenured senior photographer.","Photographers have long played a critical role in shaping narratives in a league defined by faces and moments. The most iconic posters are the finished works of the photographers who position themselves along the baseline each game, often contorting their bodies and forgetting about personal comfort to get closer and take countless snaps, in hopes of capturing a masterpiece.","In today’s N.B.A., they allow players to use those photographs as building blocks for their social media profiles. They have adapted to an ever-changing digital world that has presented new opportunities and a whole new set of challenges.","On game day, Butler uses a combination of tethered remotes and custom phone apps to operate any number of cameras in an arena.","He sends photographs to a team of editors in Secaucus, N.J., with the press of a button. In seconds, they can be published on the league’s official social media feeds and reach millions of people around the world.","Despite the technological advances, shooting an N.B.A. game can be more difficult than one would think. “A basketball game is a complex situation,” said Bruce Ely, the lead photographer of the Portland Trail Blazers. “There are a lot of moving parts.”","Like a fan’s arms waving across the frame just as Damian Lillard makes a 3-pointer. Or the leg of another player sneaking into the edge of the image, ruining a portrait. Another time, it might be a referee walking into a perfect shot.","Despite the challenges, some N.B.A. photographers do not consider it their most difficult assignment. Nelson Campana, the team photographer for the Toronto Raptors, regularly shoots weddings as well. The pressure of game night is nothing compared with the responsibility of chronicling a couple’s special day.","“You have one night to make it right,” Campana said. “There’s a list of things you need to get, and you don’t get another chance. At a basketball game, you’re just hoping things happen.”","Some nights, there is too much happening at the same time. As the Oklahoma City Thunder eliminated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2016 playoffs, Butler had to make a split-second decision about what to photograph at the buzzer. He focused on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook embracing, and then got a shot of Durant with Tim Duncan. He stayed with Durant afterward, but that meant missing a chance to capture Duncan walking off an N.B.A. court for the final time.","“Ideally,” Butler said, “I would like to be in two places at one time.”","While some players enjoy being on the other side of these photographers’ lenses, others say it is an adjustment. Aaron Gordon of the Orlando Magic first remembers being in front of a camera as a high schooler being interviewed after winning a basketball tournament.","“You have to live in a way where you’re O.K. with being seen,” Gordon said. “You’re always being watched these days.”","Because so many photos are being taken, players have to accept that they can control only so much of what is shared online.","“You want to nitpick every single picture,” said John Collins, a second-year forward with the Atlanta Hawks. “But it just can’t work that way. You can’t read everything about yourself and see every photo of yourself.”","To take more control over their visual narratives on social media, players are working with photographers to shoot them outside basketball arenas.","Cassy Athena is a professional photographer who has earned the trust of players around the league. Last season, at All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Athena followed Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha, for the entire weekend. She was also invited by Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo to shoot him at New York Fashion Week in 2018.",Athena says it takes time to convince certain players of the value of her photographs.,"“It’s not so much they don’t understand the importance of the moment,” she said. “It’s convincing them why they should share it with the world. When it clicks, you get guys who might not be the best N.B.A. player, but they use this” — meaning Instagram and professional photos — “to build their own brand and further their careers.”","Older, more established players worry less about their online persona but more about how the images carry a nostalgic value as their careers wind down.","“What photographers do may seem minute,” said Vince Carter, 42, who just ended his 21st season in the league. “But I’ve seen so many shots of the best moments of my career, and in some ways, they’ve helped me remember those moments.”",Many of these iconic images can now be seen on the Instagram pages of the photographers themselves. Bernstein said he was the last guy dragged kicking and screaming into the social media era. He now enjoys posting classic pictures for Throwback Thursday.,"Butler adds watermarks to the photographs he posts on his feed because other accounts and publications will often publish them without giving him credit. But he recognizes the value of being online. “It opens you up to a whole other audience,” Butler said.","The rise of social media accounts means there are now more photographers at N.B.A. games. Butler prefers to use a camera lens that does not require him to be right in the face of players to capture them up close. In the modern era, he has noticed a lot of camera phones being shoved into players’ faces.","“There’s an etiquette that doesn’t exist anymore,” Butler said. “Not just in sports, but in society.”","Even though photographers want to capture every moment, some also realize that there are boundaries. A few months ago, Kyrie Irving and Durant had a private conversation at All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, N.C., which was captured on film. It was circulated online, and many believed the two were discussing their heavily rumored plans to join the Knicks together this summer.","“If I was a player, that would bother me,” Butler said. “You don’t have to document every second of their existence.”","Bernstein had a similar decision to make more than 30 years ago, during the 1988 N.B.A. finals, when he walked through the Lakers’ locker room after a loss and found Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper with their uniforms on, dejected as the showers were running around them.","It was a one-of-a-kind moment, but Bernstein opted against taking the photograph.","“That was their time,” Bernstein said. “That didn’t need to be documented. I have that picture in my mind, and that’s enough.”"
"In Alabama, a Girl’s High School Hoop Dreams Are Restored - The New York Times",An Alabama girl’s banishment from high school basketball came to an end on Friday morning when a circuit court judge accomplished what appeals to state boards and outcries from some of the most prominent voices in sports could not.,"After the parents of Maori Davenport filed a motion on Thursday to get their daughter back on the basketball court, Judge Sonny Reagan of Pike County Circuit Court ruled that Davenport could return to competition pending a hearing. He will decide whether she deserved to be ruled ineligible for accepting a mistaken payment from the sport’s national governing body for playing on a junior national team last summer.","The effect will be almost immediate. Davenport, 18, a star forward at Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Ala., was set to play with her team on Friday night against Carroll High School.","Last season, Davenport averaged 18.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.2 blocks a game in leading Charles Henderson to the Alabama Class 5A state title. The year before, in a losing effort in the state title game, she had 20 points and 25 rebounds and swatted away 19 shots, an Alabama state record. She has committed to play at Rutgers.","Her athletic eligibility became a cause célèbre in the past week. On Nov. 30, Davenport, a 6-foot-4 forward, was called into her principal’s office and told that the Alabama High School Athletic Association had ruled her ineligible for one year, her senior season.","The suspension was not for poor grades or unsportsmanlike conduct. It was because of a clerical error that U.S.A. Basketball, the sport’s national governing body, readily admitted to having made, and the decision to suspend her became one of the more mind-boggling stories for those who follow amateur sports.","“That was very heartbreaking for me,” Davenport said this week of the suspension. “The only thing I could think is that I was in shock and devastated.”","The trouble began harmlessly enough over the summer, when Davenport represented the United States at the FIBA Under-18 Women’s Americas Championship in Mexico City. She led the team in rebounding and blocks as it won gold.",U.S.A. Basketball compensates players who compete on national teams to make up for wages they could have earned working summer jobs rather than practicing or competing. The N.C.A.A. allows college athletes to accept those payments. It calls them broken-time payments.,"For players with high school eligibility remaining, U.S.A. Basketball typically inquires with individual state high school athletics associations to see if the payments can be accepted. Policies can vary by state.","In this case, because of what Craig Miller, a spokesman for U.S.A. Basketball, termed a clerical error, nobody checked with the state high school athletic associations for the three players on the under-18 team with high school eligibility remaining. U.S.A. Basketball sent checks for $857.20 to Davenport and every other player on the team. On Aug. 27, Mario Davenport, Maori’s father, received it. Two days later, she cashed it.","Two months later, U.S.A. Basketball realized the error. In November, an employee called the Alabama athletics association, which told the U.S.A. Basketball employee that under Alabama rules, athletes could accept broken-time payments only if the value was less than $200. On Nov. 26, a U.S.A. Basketball official called Davenport’s mother, Tara Davenport, and informed her that Maori was not allowed to accept the stipend. The next day, Tara Davenport reported the violation to the state association and informed Charles Henderson High School officials, and on Nov. 28 she repaid U.S.A. Basketball.","Two days later, the state ruled Davenport ineligible for the rest of the season. Two appeals boards have upheld the ruling.","On Wednesday afternoon, Tara Davenport said she hoped attention from the news media, as well as pressure from Alabama politicians, would convince the association to change the ruling. The Alabama House Republican Caucus unanimously approved a resolution supporting Maori Davenport, and its members were among the many local politicians supporting her. If the association’s officials were unwilling to change their ruling, Tara Davenport was prepared to take the next step.","“If they don’t, we are definitely going to take some legal action to try to help get her on the court,” she said. The next day, she and Mario Davenport filed a lawsuit in Pike County Circuit Court seeking their daughter’s reinstatement.","Since Maori Davenport’s final appeal was denied in December, attention and pressure had been building.","The story gained national attention recently after Jay Bilas, an ESPN college basketball analyst who was once called “the N.C.A.A.’s most dangerous critic,” wrote a column blistering Steve Savarese, the executive director for the state athletic association. Bilas accused Savarese of “blindly asserting authority without regard for whom it may hurt, or the reasonable likelihood of a similar issue recurring in the future.” On Thursday, the tennis legend Billie Jean King joined the N.B.A. star DeMarcus Cousins and a chorus of others in voicing their support for the player.","The association did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the judge’s ruling, and earlier in the week it declined to make Savarese available for an interview. On Tuesday, Johnny Hardin, the president of the association’s Central Board of Control — which heard and denied Davenport’s final appeal — released a statement asserting that “facts involved in the ruling have either been misstated or ignored.”","According to Brock Kelley, the Charles Henderson High School principal, it is the association’s facts that are misleading.","Hardin’s statement says that Tara Davenport is a certified basketball coach and therefore should know the eligibility rules. Kelley wrote in an email that Tara Davenport, who is a fifth-grade teacher, coaches middle school basketball, for which there is no rules test. Hardin’s statement says Kelley has not attended an association rules conference for the past three years. Kelley wrote that his school’s athletic director had attended each one and that the amateurism rule had not been covered at the last meeting.",Tara Davenport emphasized that neither she nor her daughter had hidden the check. They simply thought that U.S.A. Basketball had done its due diligence and that they could accept it.,"“I reported it as soon as I knew that Maori wasn’t supposed to have it,” she said.","Kelley, the high school principal, and Miller, the U.S.A. Basketball spokesman, focused on how institutionalized the payments are. After U.S.A. Basketball sent the check but before Tara Davenport received it, Kelley wrote, she received a call from Jeff Walz. Walz is the women’s basketball coach at the University of Louisville and was also the coach of the United States under-18 team. Walz asked Tara Davenport if she had received the check yet. She said she had not and asked whether Maori could accept it. Walz told her that she was allowed to and that it was permitted by the N.C.A.A.",Louisville officials did not respond to a request to comment.,"In Maori Davenport’s absence, the Charles Henderson girls basketball team has won all but two games and is the top-ranked 5A team in the state. Davenport is attending school, going to practices and working on her game with an outside trainer. She said she was focusing on ball-handling skills and other drills that would allow her to play more as a wing.","On Friday night, she will get her first opportunity to show off those newly developed skills in a competitive game."
"Corey Maggette Accused of Rape at Duke by Fairfax Accuser, Friends Say - The New York Times","The woman who has accused Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Justin E. Fairfax, of raping her said that a former N.B.A. player, Corey Maggette, raped her at Duke University 20 years ago and that school officials did not pursue the claim, according to a childhood friend of the woman and Facebook messages the woman exchanged with another friend.","Mr. Maggette, who attended Duke for one year, 1998-99, and reached the national championship game, played in the N.B.A. until 2013 and has since worked as a television analyst for Fox Sports.","Mr. Maggette denied the accusation through a spokesman Monday evening. “It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson’s lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations,” Mr. Maggette said in a statement. “I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge.”","A spokeswoman for Fox Sports West, where Mr. Maggette is a basketball analyst, said in an email, “Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter. We have no further comment at this time.”","Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer for the woman who accused Mr. Maggette and Mr. Fairfax, Meredith Watson, said in a statement Friday that Ms. Watson had been raped by a Duke basketball player during her sophomore year but did not name the player. Ms. Smith also said that Ms. Watson had reported her rape to an unspecified dean at the university, but that the dean had “discouraged her from pursuing the claim further.”","Duke has acknowledged it is investigating an allegation that a player raped the woman, but a spokesman for the university declined to comment on the identity of the player or the assertion that the university failed to act on the accusation.","“We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed,” said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke. “We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time.”","Years before Ms. Watson came forward as the second woman to publicly accuse Mr. Fairfax of sexual assault, inflaming a political crisis in Virginia, she told multiple friends that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette, according to one of those friends and Facebook messages exchanged with another.","R. Stanton Jones, a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington who grew up with Ms. Watson in Baltimore, said she told him that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette. She told Mr. Jones about it while he and Ms. Watson were both home for the summer in 2001, he said.","“Meredith told me she had been raped twice at Duke,” Mr. Jones said. “And she told me that one of the men who raped her was the Duke basketball player Corey Maggette. That was a name I knew because I’m a basketball fan.”","Mr. Jones, who did not attend Duke, said he had not had much contact with Ms. Watson in the last decade “other than occasionally liking a Facebook post.” He said he was coming forward now because it “seemed like the right thing to do.”","The longtime coach of Duke’s men’s basketball team, Mike Krzyzewski, said after his team’s victory against Virginia on Saturday night that he had “no knowledge” of the situation and that he had learned of it only from news media reports Friday.","Karen Kessler, a spokeswoman for Ms. Watson, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Ms. Watson and a friend from March 2017. Ms. Kessler declined to identify the friend, whose name was blacked out in the messages, and The Times was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the messages.","In the messages, Ms. Watson expressed disgust at a newspaper article written about Mr. Fairfax, who had already announced his bid for lieutenant governor. After the friend asked Ms. Watson whether she had reported the rape, Ms. Watson responded: “You know I didn’t report it after how the university responded when I reported Corey Maggette.”","Ms. Kessler said that after being discouraged by the dean, Ms. Watson decided not to report her accusation to the police.",Mr. Krzyzewski — who is in his 39th season coaching the Blue Devils and is college basketball’s leader in wins — and Duke have held themselves up not only as consummate winners but as moral exemplars.,"No Duke player under Mr. Krzyzewski was kicked off the team until early 2015, when a player was dismissed for unspecified struggles to meet “necessary obligations.” The university’s student newspaper, The Duke Chronicle, reported that the player, Rasheed Sulaimon, had been accused of sexual assault by two students, allegations the athletics department had been aware of as early as 10 months before terminating his participation with the team. (Sulaimon was not charged, and later played for Maryland.)"
Can a Middle-Aged Dad Still Perfect His Jump Shot? - The New York Times,"I was 8 years old when my parents — both graduate students from India — moved from married student housing to a little home in Raleigh, N.C., with a basketball hoop in the backyard. Even as an immigrant from South Asia, I knew what that hoop meant.","Basketball is a religion in North Carolina, and I quickly became a disciple. When I was 11, the N.C. State Wolfpack won the N.C.A.A. championship in heart-stopping fashion. I still remember my dad taking me to the center of campus for the midnight celebration and being transfixed by the sheer size and emotion of it.",My love for the game soon became an obsession. I taught myself to shoot in the backyard and played against the neighborhood kids. I learned to make up for my disadvantages on the court — both real (I’m definitely undersized) and perceived (no one expected a short Indian kid to be any good) — through hustle and perfecting a low left-handed heave that I used whenever I could beat my man into the lane.,"My crowning achievement came in the final seconds of a Little League championship game, when I went to the free-throw line with my team down a point. Both shots clanked around the rim but went in.","In college, watching the sport became equally addictive — especially now that I was at UNC-Chapel Hill. My senior year, the Tar Heels won their fourth N.C.A.A. Championship.","Now, at age 47, I am a New York City dad who watches Carolina basketball obsessively with his three sons and who, after a 15 year hiatus (thanks to a couple of knee surgeries) decided to play pickup again. But on the court recently, I came to a shocking realization.",My ugly but effective left-handed heave was no longer effective. I had become the player in the pickup game who everyone leaves open from a distance.,"Call it ego, but I really didn’t want to be that guy. So I turned to the only expert I knew — my 10-year-old son’s basketball coach.","Macky Bergman, 35, runs Steady Buckets, a nonprofit that teaches more than 1,000 boys and girls from around the city. Coach Macky, as everyone calls him, is a product of New York City basketball — he was a star player at Bronx Science and played four years at the University of Rochester. He assured me that anyone could learn to shoot if they put the time in.","But could a middle-aged, undersized father of three really remake his jump shot and become a solid pickup basketball player again?","Coach Macky and I met in early October on a typical outdoor court — fenced-in blacktop, metal backboards, rims with no nets — on Second Avenue and 19th Street. It was 8 a.m. on a weekday, so the place was vacant, except for a grousing tenant who lived near the court and asked us to practice as far away from his home as possible. This somewhat safe space meant I could relax a little, although the pressure was still on, as both Macky and the Times photographer, sent to track my progress, were both former college players.","We began with a shooting test: a series of midrange and 3-point jumpers while moving between five spots on the court. I did this 10 times, shooting 10 free throws after each round. By the end I was drenched in sweat.","The results weren’t great — 62 percent from the free-throw line, 49 percent on 2-point jumpers and an abysmal 30 percent from the 3-point line. As for my self-taught shooting technique, which even my son, Kavi, had described as “pretty ugly,” Coach Macky decided we would have to start over from scratch.","In our first few sessions, we set about erasing the muscle memory of 1983 to develop proper form. We started as close to the basket as possible — almost directly under the rim.","The ball was to be perched just above my eyes, on the fingertips of my left hand, directly underneath the right angle at the bend of my elbow. My guide hand would hold the right side of the ball.","For my lower body: knees bent, feet shoulder-width apart, weight on the balls of my feet. Then I was to push the ball up — not out — release and follow through, fingers pointed down.","“On the follow-through, Kobe sometimes joins his thumb and index finger, and his guide hand points at the basket,” Macky would say. “Steph Curry’s guide hand flips out and his arms come together.”","The more shots I took — the goal was 100 baskets in a row — the more I could feel myself adapting. Set, shoot, follow-through. Take one step forward and catch the ball as it comes through the net. Repeat. It was surprisingly meditative. Before I knew it, I had made it all the way to 88 shots in a row.",But Macky had identified some weaknesses.,"For one, I was landing with one leg practically a foot in front of the other. Macky had me stick a soccer ball between my legs and practice a series of jump shots while squeezing it between my knees.","This was surprisingly hard — either I’d brick the shot, or the soccer ball would pop out — until I focused on taking really small jumps, landing like I was on train tracks. Kavi even sort of complimented me, calling this an “advanced drill” that only the teenagers do.","Coach Macky encouraged me to attend his weekly shooting clinic at a high school on the Lower East Side with about two dozen of his other students. They were all between 8 and 14 years old, including my son.","I tried to blend in by standing with the coaches. That didn’t last long. When Macky assigned me to work with one of them, Torrence Ested, the first thing Coach Torrence said to me was, “I got you old man.”","When I asked Kavi who he thought was more embarrassed by the whole venture — me or him — his vague reply spoke volumes. “Tough to say,” he responded.","For the final lessons, Coach Macky moved me out to the 3-point line. I’d never been comfortable shooting the three. Because my old jump shot was a heave that began at the chest, it was all arms and no legs.","As it turned out, I’d been learning how to be a better 3-point shooter all along. Proper technique and good arc make for a more accurate shot, regardless of distance.","The difference was clear in my final set of drills. I shot above 70 percent from the free throw line, 65 percent on my two pointers, and a remarkably improved 55 percent from 3-point range.","But improving my stats was never really the point. I’ve started hooping again at the McBurney YMCA on West 14th Street and reconnecting with the sport I’ve loved since I was a kid practicing in the backyard. My jumper is still a work in progress, but I’m not being left wide open on it anymore.","At a recent pickup session — with adults, this time — I was shooting for the last spot in the next game and was matched against the best shooter in our group. We both made our first two free throws, but on the third shot his bounced out. Mine found the bottom of the net.","Not quite the Little League championship game, but I’ll take it."
Joe Harris: Walking Down Your Street and Pushing the Nets Up the Standings - The New York Times,"As Nets guard Joe Harris walks the cobblestone streets outside the team’s practice facility in Sunset Park, no one seems to notice.","“Most of the time, I blend in,” he said. “I kind of look like I work in a Brooklyn coffee shop.”","Harris’s journey from unemployed castoff to indispensable starter mirrors the rise of the Nets, a team reconstructed through savvy draft picks and second-chance signings. Without a marquee star, the Nets have won 19 of their last 25 games, and they are on a six-game winning streak against opponents in the stronger Western Conference.","The Nets had 28 victories last season; now, despite a loss in Boston on Monday, they have the sixth-best record in the Eastern Conference (27-24), and playoff talk is brewing. The injury-riddled team has weathered the loss of Caris LeVert, out with a foot injury since November, and now is without Spencer Dinwiddie, a strong candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year Award, who may be out until mid-March with a thumb injury. In Dinwiddie’s absence, the next-man-up Nets will look to G League call-ups and increased scoring from everyone.","“I almost look at Joe as one of the poster boys for the Brooklyn Nets,” the veteran DeMarre Carroll said. “He came in, wasn’t really guaranteed his first year, got on the team, worked his butt off. Each year, he’s gotten better; his numbers, his play, his confidence proves it.”","Three years ago, Harris, then with the Cleveland Cavaliers, had the worst day of his basketball life. In a period of a few hours, he had foot surgery, was traded to Orlando and was immediately waived. He was out of the league for six months before the Nets signed him to a minimum contract for less than $1 million in 2016. Last summer, he signed a two-year, $16 million deal to remain with the Nets.","“His story is about opportunity and development on a team starting to improve,” Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “Given where he came from, it’s a romantic story, a beautiful story. Everything about him — his humility, the fact that he rides the subway everywhere — is why everybody loves Joe.”","Harris’s romance with the game began in Chelan, Wash., where his father coached high school basketball. In fourth grade, Harris came home one afternoon and asked his mother if he could write his basketball goals on his bedroom walls. She assumed he would scribble them on paper and tape them up. Instead, he took a marker and wrote directly on the walls and ceiling. The writings remain in his childhood bedroom, frozen in the amber of a 9-year-old’s penmanship.","Given that Chelan is a small town with only two gyms, the worst time of the year was when the courts were being refinished, leaving Harris nowhere to play. One time after an interminable wait, a 10-year-old Harris ran onto the court, slid on his stomach and kissed the floor. “Baby, I’m back!” he screamed.","“That pretty much sums me up as a kid,” Harris said. “I just love basketball.”","To the right of his childhood bed is his favorite quotation from John Wooden, which he easily recites from memory: “Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing that you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.”","There are also lines from Charles Barkley, Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and others, as well as a list of goals. The last goal on the list: “Become a pro.”","After playing four years at Virginia, Harris was drafted in the second round by Cleveland in 2014. He played sparingly for two seasons on the LeBron James-led Cavaliers. A few months after he was released, he watched Cleveland win its first N.B.A. title.","This season, Harris was averaging 13.4 points a game through Sunday and had the third-best 3-point shooting percentage in the N.B.A. (46.8 percent). Among players with at least 300 field-goal attempts this season, he was eighth at 61.4 in effective field-goal percentage, trailing only Golden State’s Stephen Curry (62.1) among guards and wing players, according to Basketball-Reference.com.","“We want him to shoot more bad shots because he’s such a great shooter, but he won’t because he’s such a good guy,” Atkinson said.","The pace-and-space era of the N.B.A. has made a player like Harris, a sharpshooter who creates space on the floor and strikes when opportunity arises, more valuable.","“The game has slowed down for him,” Atkinson said. “His first two years he was making turnovers, not reading situations right. He used to be a defensive liability, and now we put him sometimes on the best shooter.","“I’m pleased that he’s played beyond his contract. For a guy who wasn’t even in the league, he became a stalwart, a guy you can count on.”","Casual sports fans may struggle to name a player on the Nets, particularly one who is a regular … well, Joe. The team shot an amusing video spoofing Harris’s accuracy in hopes of earning him a spot in the All-Star 3-point shooting contest.","Harris visited spots around Brooklyn — he tossed oranges into a shopping cart, lofted eggs into a hot frying pan and shot some coins into a tip jar.","“Joey Buckets! He deserves to be in the contest,” Carroll said when asked about his teammate. Throughout games, Harris is serenaded — “Jo-ey Buck-ets” — by the superfans in the Brooklyn Brigade section of Barclays Center. It’s one of many nicknames. Others include Lumber Joe and Beef Jerky Joe.","Beef Jerky Joe? “Like the Sasquatch from the commercial,” Harris said with a laugh.","Though Harris has blended into Brooklyn, in truth he is an accidental hipster. On a walk to the Food Hall at the Industry City development in Sunset Park, he was wearing black because it just happens to be the Nets’ team color. His slightly slouchy knit cap was pulled low to fight the chilly gusts from the Brooklyn waterfront. The lumberjack beard was a remnant of a no-shave off-season.","Every Nets player except Jared Dudley lives in Brooklyn, a throwback to when the Dodgers were Brooklyn’s team and the players raised their children in the borough and car-pooled to Ebbets Field.","Harris walks to Barclays Center on game days. After practices, Atkinson frequently sees him with his backpack, headed to the subway.","“He signed a big contract; you’d think he’d get a car service,” Atkinson said. “But that’s him, and that’s us. We’ve had a little success, but we’re still humble.”","In the Food Hall, there’s everything a local might expect, like Korean comfort food and an all-avocado restaurant. Harris stopped for a cup of … well, you know. Not a nitro, cold brew or pour over, mind you.",“How do you like it?” the barista asked Harris.,"“Black,” he said."
"Magic Johnson’s Time With the Lakers: Short, Chaotic and Playoff-Free - The New York Times","In his two years as president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson presided over a team as chaotic and playoff-free as the one he’d inherited.","The Lakers succeeded in stockpiling talent — including the franchise-altering signing of LeBron James — but failed in putting together complementary pieces, or attracting the second major star Johnson openly said he was chasing.",[Magic Johnson stunned the basketball world by suddenly stepping down on Tuesday.],Here’s a look back at Johnson’s high and low points while running the team.,"In February 2017, four seasons into the team’s longest-ever playoff drought, the Lakers reshuffled their front office by firing the general manager, Mitch Kupchak, and installing Johnson as its president. Less than a month later, Rob Pelinka, a longtime agent, was hired as the general manager, reporting to Johnson.","Officially and unofficially, Johnson had remained tied to the team since he retired in 1996. He owned a share of the team from 1994 to 2010, and after that he was an honorary vice president — a title the team took away from him after he violated the league’s tampering rules by tweeting about free agents.","Three weeks before he was hired in his new role, he had returned to the Lakers as an adviser to Jeanie Buss, the team’s president and co-owner. She would soon clean house while promoting Johnson.","“Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself,” she said, using Johnson’s given name. “We are determined to get back to competing to win N.B.A. championships again.”",The first major test of the new regime had decidedly mixed results.,"Days before the draft, Johnson shed the costly contract of Timofey Mozgov by giving up on D’Angelo Russell, whom the team had selected second over all just two years earlier. In return for the duo, the Brooklyn Nets gave up Brook Lopez and the 27th pick in the draft, which turned into the promising Kyle Kuzma. But Russell has blossomed this year with the Nets, earning an All-Star appearance while leading Brooklyn back to the playoffs.","Russell’s departure opened the point guard spot for Lonzo Ball, who has flashed two-way potential but largely fallen short of his lofty expectations as the second pick in the draft. In addition to Kuzma, the Lakers struck gold with Josh Hart, who was selected 30th and has become a core piece.","Johnson made no secret of his intent to draw the game’s biggest stars to Los Angeles, with an eye toward what was expected to be a major 2018 off-season. The team largely punted on the 2017 off-season to preserve its salary cap space in 2018, signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a one-year deal.","At the 2018 trade deadline, the Lakers shed the contracts of Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr., opening more cap space. Johnson said the trade indicated the Lakers would have the cap space and the ability to land two star players, either by trade or free agency.","“I wouldn’t have made the move if I wasn’t confident,” he said at the time.","Signing LeBron James to a long-term contract in 2018 was exactly the kind of result the Lakers had planned for and needed, setting expectations that they would return to the playoffs and compete for a championship. But the free agents the Lakers signed to surround him — Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson, JaVale McGee and Michael Beasley — immediately puzzled some observers.",An optimist would have called them playoff-tested veterans. Others saw it differently: A cast of nonshooters and big personalities who would have a questionable fit next to James and the Lakers’ young talent.,"The hodgepodge crew was assembled partly because the team struck out on its bigger targets. After years of speculation that Paul George would return to his hometown, he instead opted to re-sign with Oklahoma City. The San Antonio Spurs sent Kawhi Leonard east to the Toronto Raptors. DeMarcus Cousins signed a bargain, one-year deal with the Golden State Warriors.","Once the season arrived, the Lakers blew it in dramatic fashion, extending their record playoff drought. But they preserved cap space for the 2019 off-season, giving them another chance to add a star.","There could be little doubt the Lakers would be interested in Anthony Davis as soon as he became available. James and Davis share an agent, and the Lakers were long believed to be Davis’s most committed suitor.","But when the All-Star center made a public trade request in late January, he created a debacle for Johnson and the Lakers. The players in the Lakers’ young core — Ball, Kuzma, Hart and Brandon Ingram, the second overall pick from the 2016 draft — were constantly named in leaked trade offers.","The Pelicans made an effort to head off any potential tampering when they announced Davis’s trade request. “We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction,” the team said in a statement.","In addition to Davis’s connections to the Lakers, Los Angeles had a well-known history of tampering, dating back to Johnson’s tweets before he took over.","Johnson was not very subtle about recruiting George during a 2017 appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” during which he was asked what he would do if he saw the player socially.","“We’re going to say hi because we know each other, you just can’t say, ‘Hey, I want you to come to the Lakers,’ even though I’ll be wink-winking like, ‘You know what that means, right?’ ”","The episode earned Johnson a warning from the N.B.A., and the team was later fined $500,000 for what the league deemed impermissible contact between Pelinka and George’s agent.","In June 2018, Johnson was fined $50,000 for his comments about Giannis Antetokounmpo after praising the Bucks star.","In February, the Sixers’ Ben Simmons — who plays as an oversize point guard, like Johnson did — requested a meeting with Johnson to get playing tips, prompting Johnson to publicly praise the former Rookie of the Year. But the league ultimately determined Johnson had not broken tampering rules."
LeBron James Set to Return to Practice With Lakers Next Week - The New York Times,"LeBron James, sidelined since Dec. 25 with a groin strain, will remain out until at least next week, the Los Angeles Lakers announced Wednesday. The team said in a statement that James did not travel with the Lakers on their current road trip for games against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday and the Houston Rockets on Saturday.","The Lakers have struggled without James — and without Rajon Rondo, their backup point guard, who was also injured in the Lakers’ road win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. Entering Thursday, the Lakers had gone 4-7 without those two players and were tied with the Sacramento Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference standings.",[On Pro Basketball: The Warriors Prepare to Add Another Star: DeMarcus Cousins],"After their current trip, the Lakers will return home to play the Warriors on Monday — which, incidentally, is slated to be Game 2 of the Warriors’ well-publicized DeMarcus Cousins experiment as he returns from surgery on his Achilles’ tendon — but it is highly unlikely that James will be available. The Lakers said in their statement that James “has been cleared to return to practice commencing next week, and progress toward a return to game play thereafter.”","James, 34, had been fairly indestructible thus far in his career. He appeared in all 82 regular-season games for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season. But while the Lakers initially listed James as “day to day” after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam last month, the team has been handling him — and his eventual return — with caution.","James was playing some of the best basketball of his career before he got hurt, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game. A four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, he is in the first year of a four-year contract worth $154 million."
"John MacLeod, a Winning Coach for the Suns, Is Dead at 81 - The New York Times","John MacLeod, the coach who led the Phoenix Suns on an improbable run to the 1976 National Basketball Association finals against the Boston Celtics — a series that included one of the most memorable playoff games in N.B.A. history — died on Sunday. He was 81.","MacLeod’s son, Matt, confirmed the death to The Associated Press but did not say where he died. The elder MacLeod had Alzheimer’s disease for more than a decade.","MacLeod joined the Suns in 1973 after they had ended a 38-44 season. At the time the Suns, who joined the league in the 1968-69 season, had never won an N.B.A. playoff series.","His first two seasons in Phoenix were rocky, but in time he became the most successful coach in Suns history, going 579-543 in the regular seasons over 14 years.","MacLeod’s first winning season with the Suns ended with a 42-40 record, just enough to edge them into the 1976 playoffs. Phoenix then went on a dramatic run that culminated in their defeating the top-ranked Golden State Warriors for the Western Conference championship in seven games.","The finals against the Celtics featured a tense fifth game, with the teams tied at two games apiece, that went into triple overtime at Boston Garden and into the basketball history books.","Coming back from far behind, Phoenix tied the game at the end of regulation play and again at the end of the first overtime. Many fans swarmed the court after the Celtics star John Havlicek sunk a shot at the end of the second overtime to put Boston ahead, 111-110. But the referees ruled that a second remained on the clock and cleared the court.","The game, with an unruly capacity crowd in the stands, went into a third overtime because of a canny decision. With that one second remaining, the Suns Hall of Fame guard Paul Westphal called a timeout, even though Phoenix had none left. That cost the Suns a technical foul and gave Boston another point on a successful free throw, but it also gave the Suns the ball at center court for a final play. The Suns forward Gar Heard took the inbounds pass, shot and tied the score, 112-112.","“Credit that move to Paul Westphal,” MacLeod told The New York Times. “He thought of it while we were trying to map out a play. But with all those fans surrounding him, taunting our players and causing more fights, how could a coach coach? It was the most dangerous situation I’ve ever been in.”","In the end, the Celtics triumphed, 128-126, and won the series, four games to two.

"Paul George, at Peace in Oklahoma City, Reels In a Career Year - The New York Times","Paul George has a small freshwater pond behind his house in Oklahoma City that he stocks with bass, crappie and bluegill. Whenever he has a couple of hours to spare from his responsibilities as a do-everything forward for the N.B.A.’s Thunder, he heads out back with his fishing rod. He releases what he catches — for now, anyway.","“Waiting for them to get a little bigger,” he said.","George has time. Last summer, on the first night of free agency, he agreed to re-sign with the Thunder on a four-year, $137 million deal. The news emanated from a house party that Russell Westbrook, his superstar teammate, was hosting for George, who did not even entertain meetings with rival teams. He was sticking with the Thunder.","In doing so, George made clear that he was banking on his partnership with Westbrook while offering endorsements of the organization and of Oklahoma City’s leisurely pace. He can fish. He can raise his two young children in a quiet neighborhood. And he can focus on basketball, knowing that his future is with the Thunder.","“You can give your everything to one organization, and you know the direction that you’re going,” George said in a recent interview. “There’s so much that players have to deal with that I don’t think people quite recognize. A lot of them are the same issues that everybody else deals with. But this takes a lot of the burden off my shoulders.”","There is something to be said for (relatively) stress-free living. As several other stars careen toward free agency this summer — and grapple with the accompanying distractions with varying degrees of success — George, 28, has been playing the best basketball of his life.","He is averaging 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists, all career highs, while shooting 44 percent from the field and 39.1 percent from 3-point range. He is at least in the conversation for his first N.B.A. Most Valuable Player Award.","“I think the shift I’ve seen,” Coach Billy Donovan said, “is a guy who’s a lot more comfortable.”","George has been limited recently by shoulder soreness, and Oklahoma City has slipped a bit in the standings. But the Thunder are capable of being a force in the playoffs, and they appear to be a close-knit group. One reason: Oklahoma City is not exactly flush with “extracurriculars,” as George put it, so the players tend to linger at the practice facility. They spend a lot of time together, which has helped build chemistry.","“And if one person has to go do something, there’s always someone else who’s like, ‘I’ll tag along with you,’” George said. “That’s kind of been the culture here.”","George was traded to the Thunder before the start of last season, after he told the Indiana Pacers that he would not sign a contract extension. Most figured that Oklahoma City would be a pit stop for George, who grew up in Palmdale, Calif., about 50 miles north of Los Angeles. More to the point: He had told the Pacers that he wanted to be shipped to the Lakers.","Indiana balked and instead dealt him to Oklahoma City, where George averaged 21.9 points and 5.7 rebounds last season. After Oklahoma City lost in the first round of the playoffs, George was a free agent. He could have gone nearly anywhere, including to the Lakers.","“I had so many phone calls and people asking me what he would do when it was all still up in the air,” Tom Hegre, his former coach at Knight High School, said in a telephone interview. “But I personally felt that he would stay with the Thunder. I just didn’t think he would bail on something before he gave it a legitimate chance.”","Hegre also said he suspected that Oklahoma City itself had something to do with George’s decision. Even now, after six All-Star appearances, George is a small-town guy and a self-described “homebody.”","Back in his high school days, George and his father would occasionally ask Hegre if the team was planning to practice over the weekend. Hegre knew that meant they were thinking about going fishing. They had their favorite spots: Hughes Lake, Lake Elsinore, Lopez Lake, Little Rock Reservoir.","“I always thought that was pretty cool,” Hegre said.","George has never played in a major market. Not in high school (Palmdale). Not in college (Fresno State). And not in the N.B.A., which may not be a coincidence. When he was with the Pacers, George lived in a suburban community with a large lake, where he kept a boat. He fished there, too.","At the same time, his exit from Indiana affected him. It was the first time he felt disliked by the masses, and he was someone who had always tried hard to avoid disappointing or hurting people, said Steve Cleveland, his former coach at Fresno State.","When George told Cleveland that he was entering the N.B.A. draft after two seasons at Fresno State, he was apologetic — and so were his parents, who kept apologizing even after George began to star for the Pacers.","“I had to say, ‘Stop it,’” Cleveland said. “But that’s the type of people they are.”","He added: “I’ve never really asked him this, but I’m sure leaving Indiana was a pretty sensitive deal for him. And I don’t think he wanted to go through all that stress again.”","It is not hard to find big-time players who have come unglued at times because of their impending free agencies. Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors boycotted the news media for a couple of weeks. Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics has complained about the steep price of celebrity. For his part, George blamed “the press” for being a disruptive force in locker rooms.","“Everything gets blown up,” he said. “Everything is a big deal.”","It is no small feat, then, that George has found a home with the Thunder — and calm waters in Oklahoma City."
"A Hunger Artist Off the Bench, Lou Williams Helps the Clippers Feast - The New York Times","Lou Williams, who has the unusual role of leading the Clippers in scoring while coming off the bench, does not run around the court so much as flutter across it. At 6 feet 1 inch and 175 pounds, he has embraced his identity as a butterfly among a herd of cattle.","But at this stage of his career, Williams wants to feel as light and nimble as possible — so he essentially starves himself on game days. After a big breakfast, he refuses to eat again until well after the game itself, often going nearly 12 hours between meals.","It is one of several habits that Williams, 32, has developed over the years, and one that clearly works for him. It is also the opposite of how most elite athletes prepare for games. But Williams is different: He wants to take the court with an appetite.","“That’s crazy,” Landry Shamet, the first-year Clippers guard, said. “I’d weigh about 115 pounds if I did that.”","The Clippers, as they often have this season, turned to Williams on Monday night for an extraordinary performance — this time against the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of their first-round playoff series. In the Clippers’ 135-131 win, Williams collected 36 points and 11 assists to help erase a 31-point deficit.","Shamet sealed the biggest comeback in N.B.A. playoff history with a go-ahead 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left, and the Clippers evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece.","“I’m one of those guys who can get hot,” said Williams, who shot 13 of 22 from the field, “and I just got lost in the moment.”","The Clippers, who have thrived behind Williams in the wake of a midseason deal that sent Tobias Harris to the Philadelphia 76ers, will need all of him again — all his scoring, all his savvy, all his unusual rituals — when the Warriors come to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday.","Make no mistake, the Clippers have their share of scrappy, no-nonsense guys. Patrick Beverley, who has spent the series covering the Warriors’ Kevin Durant like aluminum foil, would trash talk a telephone pole.","Williams, on the other hand, carries himself with a brand of quiet composure that has a power all its own.","“He goes about his business,” said Sam Cassell, an assistant coach for the Clippers. “He’s not overwhelmingly faster than people. He’s not bigger than people. But he understands what he can do on the basketball court, and he does it well.”",The Warriors’ Klay Thompson recently came across a package of highlight clips from Williams’s days as a star guard at South Gwinnett High School outside of Atlanta. What stood out to Thompson was how little Williams had changed.,"“He played the exact same way,” Thompson said in an interview before the start of the series. “It was incredible: same step-back jumper, same hesitations, same floaters.”","Williams has stuck with the same general blueprint while refining his skills — slicker, craftier, jazzier. He has also become more resilient. There was a time, he said, when he thought his career might be finished. In 2013, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while playing for the Atlanta Hawks. In his comeback, he turned to Kenny Atkinson, who was then one of the team’s assistants, to help reassemble his game.","Atkinson, now the head coach of the Nets, imbued Williams with the importance of routine.","“Kenny is one of my all-time favorite people in the world,” Williams said. “I give him a lot of credit for getting me back on my feet when I was down and out.”","By 2015, Williams was the N.B.A.’s sixth man of the year with the Toronto Raptors. But he has never been better, more efficient or more dynamic than he has been in his last two seasons with the Clippers, all at an age — early 30s — when most players see their production begin to erode.","Instead, Williams, who has scored more points off the bench than any other player in league history, has only improved. This season, he averaged 20 points and 5.4 assists in just 26.6 minutes a game. Williams also had the ball in his hands more than ever, with the Clippers running 32.4 percent of their plays through him whenever he was on the court, according to usage-rate statistics compiled by Basketball Reference.","Coming off the bench was never something that he necessarily wanted to do, but Williams has no doubt that the role has helped preserve his career because it has kept his minutes down. He has averaged 24.6 minutes a game over his 14-year career. (LeBron James, by comparison, has averaged 38.6 minutes.)","“It’s given me an opportunity to stretch my career out, and I think I’m in my prime right now, man,” Williams said. “I’m just rolling.”","At the same time, Williams has his quirky customs, which help give him a sense of stability, starting with his game-day breakfast: hash browns, egg whites, French toast and chicken sausage along with a fruit smoothie that he sweetens with honey. He loads up because he knows he won’t eat again for a while.","“I guess my body’s gotten used to it,” Williams said, who will just do the smoothie if the Clippers have an early tipoff.","He also has the peculiar habit of arriving at the arena on the late side, about 90 minutes before the start of the game.","“I don’t like idle time,” he said.","Once there, though, Williams has an active schedule: 15 minutes in the training room getting stretched out, 10 minutes in the weight room doing exercises with a stretch band and a medicine ball, then about 17 minutes on the court making 150 field goals as Cassell feeds him passes.","Before a recent home game ahead of the playoffs, Williams made nearly 80 percent of his attempts, including two skyscraping moonshots from the baseline, which is a shot that he has developed in case a 7-footer lunges at him with his arms extended. Williams says he only practices shots that he will attempt in games, however improbable or acrobatic.","“I catch myself at least two or three times a game just putting my hands up, like, ‘How did that even happen?’” Shamet said.","Williams wraps up his on-court work with 20 free throws and 10 court-width sprints, then retreats to the locker room to put on his ankle braces and check his phone. “Just to make sure there’s no family emergencies or anything like that,” he said.","With 20 minutes on the clock, the Clippers have their team meeting. Before they head to the court, Williams gathers his teammates around him for one final huddle — or rather, they gather around him, as if he has some sort of gravitational pull.","Once the game begins, Williams takes a seat on the bench — which is the only time he stops moving. But he is watching his potential defenders and studying the flow, readying himself for the moment when he sheds his warm-ups late in the first quarter.","If Cassell can pinpoint one flaw, it might be that Williams commits too many turnovers. He is an excellent passer, especially coming off ball screens — Shamet considers him one of the most underrated passers in the league — but he sometimes tries to do too much, Cassell said. So Cassell will remind Williams to do what he does best: Shoot the ball. ","It is what everyone wants to see from Williams, who is regarded around the league as a player whom other players love to watch.","“It means a lot coming from my peers,” Williams said. “I think as competitors, that’s why we get into this, to gain respect from the guys who have played the game, and you walk away and they say, ‘He was a tough cover — that dude was nice.’”",All while being fueled with a hunger of his own creation.
Knicks Come Up Short Again: Not Even the Worst Team of Last 20 Years - The New York Times,The Knicks won a basketball game Thursday night. That has not happened since Jan. 4.,"There won’t be a ticker-tape parade, but it was a surprise. This, after all, has been a really bad season for the Knicks.","They are 11-47. The win, over the Atlanta Hawks, 106-91, broke an 18-game losing streak, which was a franchise record.","The team traded away its most popular player by far, Kristaps Porzingis, and in return got a rookie and a couple of expiring contracts. The deal also meant the cancellation of the coming Latvian Heritage Night at Madison Square Garden, which frankly was shaping up to be one of the highlights of the season.","To be fair, a core of loyalists insist that these Knicks are a fun bunch to watch. And there is optimistic talk for next year.","The Knicks are bad enough to have a decent shot at the top draft pick, probably Zion Williamson, Duke’s superstar big man. Cap space will allow the team to seek big-name free agents, and there is sunny speculation that the team could land stars like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving or even both.","We’ll see about that. But for now, fans are left pondering if the Knicks are historically dreadful or just run-of-the-mill dreadful.","Let’s see how the Knicks rate, at least in the current century.","That means this year’s Knicks won’t have to compete against the consensus worst team of them all, the legendary 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers of 1972-73.","Despite a couple of 50-win seasons, in 2000 and 2013, the Knicks’ winning percentage this century is .416, worst in the N.B.A. Yes, even worse than the Washington Wizards, and Charlotte Hornets, and even the Nets.",Here is how the 2018-19 Knicks stack up.,This is where it begins and ends. Wins. Losses. But mostly losses. Lots and lots of losses.,"The Knicks are 11-47, giving them a winning percentage that looks like a typo: .190.","But there were worse seasons in the last 20 years. In 2012, the Bobcats (now the Hornets) finished at 7-59 in a lockout season for a .106 percentage.","Over a full season, the 76ers in 2016, in full tanking mode, only barely managed to break double digit wins with a 10-72 record.",The Knicks are only 11th worst.,"Even counting just those streaks that are contained in a single season, the Knicks’ 18-gamer comes up short. The 2011 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2014 76ers both managed to stumble to 26 straight losses. After Thursday’s win, the Knicks have lost their chance at that ignominious record.",The Knicks have been outscored by 8.7 points in an average game this season.,"Again, there have been worse teams. The 2012 Charlotte strike team lost by 13.9 points a game. The 2000 Clippers put up minus-11.5 over a full season.",The Knicks are only 25th.,"There are those Sixers again: In 2015, they shot .408 for the season. At .430, the Knicks are 39th.","The 2009 Grizzlies had only 17.4 assists per game, trailed closely by the 2006 Knicks of Larry Brown, Stephon Marbury and notorious nonpasser Eddy Curry.","This season’s Knicks aren’t good, but they aren’t really bad, at 19.9, for 91st place.","It is not a good time for defensive stats in the N.B.A. Using the metric points allowed per 100 possessions, three teams this season are in the top five of the century: The Cavaliers are allowing 117 points per 100, worst of the era, and indeed for as far back as Basketball-Reference’s stats go. Over the last 20 years, this season‘s Suns are second, and the Knicks, at 113.4, are seventh.",Do any of this year’s Knicks individually reach truly humiliating marks? Not really.,"Frank Ntilikina’s .342 shooting percentage is poor certainly, but it is only 24th worst among players with 15 minutes a game and 40 games played, a lot better than DeShawn Stevenson’s .285 from the 2012 Nets.","So we are forced to conclude, that while dispiritingly bad, the Knicks come up short in another way too. They are not even really close to being the worst team of the last 20 years."
Mike Budenholzer Has Come a Long Way From Bucket of Blood Street - The New York Times,"HOLBROOK, Ariz. — A wind that would not stop tugged at flags and sent sand devils spinning into this desert town as I walked past Mr. Maestas Restaurant and the Arizona Pawnman and the Empty Pockets Saloon and came to a rise and looked across an emptiness of plain that stretched the limits of vision.","I recalled my talk a few days ago with Mike Budenholzer at the Ritz-Carlton in New York City. He coaches the Milwaukee Bucks, who finished the regular season with 60 wins and the best record in the N.B.A. His team features a brilliant Greek forward-guard-center named Giannis Antetokounmpo, Montenegrin and Turkish forwards, a Spanish center, and black and white players from corners rural and urban.","He is known for his deft handling of diverse pro players. Where, I asked, did you pick up that skill?","Let me tell you about my hometown, Holbrook, he said.","Budenholzer, blue-eyed and middle-age, was once was a skinny, blond, teenage shooting guard in this old cattle and railway town. He starred on the Roadrunners basketball team at Holbrook High School alongside his boyhood friend B. J. Little, an African-American; a few Anglos; and a half-dozen Navajo boys who could run and pass all day and all night.","“There’s no doubt in mind that my background there has helped me navigate life in the N.B.A.” Budenholzer said. “Growing up, you knew Navajo culture and black culture from Louisiana and Mexicans. I learned to foster the same sort of culture.”","Holbrook comprises its own world, an isolated high desert city of 5,053 that sits on the southern lip of the Navajo Nation, which is the size of the Republic of Ireland. To the south lies the small Mormon town of Snowflake, and beyond that the forests and canyons of the White Mountain Apache Reservation, which is bigger than Delaware.","Holbrook’s population is roughly 50 percent white and 50 percent Navajo, Hopi, Mexican and black. The city has long kept a dormitory for Navajo children whose parents want them to attend the well-regarded Holbrook High School. Founded in the 1880s, Holbrook was an outlaw-friendly habitat, and a sign on the South Side tends to underline this point: Bucket of Blood Street. Terrill’s Cottage Saloon once stood on this street, and more than a few cowpokes breathed their last there.","Quite a few youngsters leave in search of better prospects. The city is tattered at the edges, a few buildings lie gape-toothed and abandoned, a motel stands vacant, and a single movie theater shows a single movie. But it’s a hospitable place, and the main drag, Navajo Boulevard, has Mexican restaurants and motels and Native American jewelry stores and a herd of giant plastic dinosaurs that signal proximity to Petrified Forest National Park.","Budenholzer’s father, Vince, coached the basketball team and won a state championship in 1971 and was inducted into the state coaching hall of fame. At the time, Mike was an assistant to Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. During a team visit to Phoenix, he told Popovich of his father’s ascent. When Vince showed up later that day, Popovich got down on a knee in the hotel and said, “Here is a real coach.”",Father and son were two hoops tramps who traveled in school buses hundreds of miles across the empty quarter of Northern Arizona in search of games and wins.,"Vince’s Holbrook teams played a variation on the Native American hoops style known as Rez Ball: A quicksilver, sneaker-squeaking, run-pass-pass-shoot style, perfect for the Navajo and the Apache, for whom distance running is a millenniums-old tradition.","“We pressed from the minute we stepped off the bus,” Vince said. ”I had one Navajo who was taller than 6 foot, and so what?”","Vince is 89 and still lean in that way of an old athlete, and he and his wife, Libby, moved nine years ago to Queen Valley, in the cactus foothills of the Superstition Mountains, east of Phoenix. They miss Holbrook; it remains the home of their hearts, but the winters on that mile-high plateau ran them off. “The winds never stop blowing,” Libby said.","The couple raised seven children, five boys and two girls, in a small house across Florida Street from Hunt Park. Libby became a councilwoman and served a term as mayor, and Vince moonlighted as Holbrook’s parks and recreation director during the summer. He built a hoop in his backyard and put up a floodlight so the teenagers could play into the evening.","Little, Mike’s old teammate who is now a judge in nearby Winslow, drove me by that house, which was sold years back. The hoop still stood.","“Oh man, we’d play there the whole night, and Vince would never stop coaching,” Little said. “My grandparents said I had to get home before the streetlights came on. But if I was playing ball with Mikey at the Budenholzers, that was my pass.”","Father and son Budenholzer flashed hauntingly similar smiles when they recalled those days. Mike was the leading scorer on the Roadrunners, a kid who could shoot from near and far and almost as well with his left hand as his right. Little, whose grandparents came from Louisiana to work in the McNary Saw Mill, ripped rebounds, and the Navajo kids dribbled and ran and pressed.","The day before the tournament, two of the best players got drunk. They were suspended, and that left the Roadrunners with one star: Mike Budenholzer. That was not enough horsepower, and the team lost. “It boggled my mind that they would get caught,” Mike said.","“I think I would give up an N.B.A. championship to get that one back,” he said.","I looked at him: You’re kidding, right? He shrugged. “I mean, winning a state championship in Arizona, that’s a big deal.”","Navajo and Mexican and Anglo kids still play baseball, basketball and football and live more or less shoulder to shoulder. “It was a town where you played everything and with everyone else,” Mike said. “The only social rule you recognized in high school was that Mormon girls don’t date non-Mormons.”",He shrugged. “So you adjust.”,"Budenholzer was a good student and got into Pomona College, a fine liberal arts institution in California. He was not yet sold. He was a jock and he wanted to play basketball and he already had a scholarship offer in hand.","He visited Pomona and sat around with other students and listened as they talked of their choices. There was the kid who was weighing Williams College or Pomona, and another who was wait-listed at Stanford University. They looked at Budenholzer and asked, What about you?","“I tell them I’m trying to choose between Pomona and Yavapai Community College, where I could get a free ride,” Budenholzer said. “And they were, like, ‘whaaaat?’ And I’m thinking, ‘What am I doing here, I’m in the wrong place.’ ”","His brothers and sisters decided Mikey, the youngest, was going to Pomona. They pooled money as best they could so he could afford it. He graduated with a degree in philosophy and economics.","Before he left Holbrook and set out on his life journey, Budenholzer did what he did every summer, which is to say he rounded up B. J. Little and other buddies and piled into a car and headed north to play in the informal spring tournaments that are a staple of life on the Navajo reservation. They drove across washes and around canyons and past red-ribbed buttes that reared like primeval monsters. They pulled into Navajo towns: Dilkon and Window Rock, Tuba City and Ganado, anywhere there was a tournament.","They got caught up in endless Rez Ball games, running and shooting and banging one another from morning till late at night. As hoops is civic religion on the rez, crowds of hundreds watched and cheered, not least for the bilagaanas (Navajo for whites).","“Those spring tournaments got rough, the referees were terrible and man, it was just the best,” Budenholzer said.","During the season when reservation teams arrived to play Holbrook, a long line of cars would follow. The rule was straightforward for Holbrook’s fans, Vince said. Make it to the gym by 4 p.m. for a 7 p.m. game, or you could forget about finding a seat.","It is not so different when Mike’s teams pull into Phoenix. After working as an assistant with the Spurs, he coached the Atlanta Hawks before coming to Milwaukee. Whenever his team plays the Phoenix Suns, Little’s sister sets to work organizing a Holbrook caravan. Dozens of cars wend their way down through ponderosa forests and jagged mountains to the game — whites, Mexicans, blacks and Navajos, sometimes 100 strong. After the game, Budenholzer talks with them.","“It always moves me,” Mike says.","It’s been a long time since he left home. This summer, after the N.B.A. playoffs and before the pro summer leagues begin, he and Vince and Libby plan to drive up through the Tonto National Forest and across the Salt River Canyon to Holbrook. And when they reach their old high school gym, they will find teammates and students and teachers and townspeople gathered to listen as Superintendent Robert Koerperich dedicates the Vince Budenholzer gym floor.","“To let our kids know that you can come out of Holbrook and coach a pro team, how amazing is that?” Koeperich says.",Mike Budenholzer looks forward to walking Navajo Boulevard and maybe seeing the family house again. Then he wants to stand behind Vince and Libby and clap so hard.,"“To have raised seven kids on a teacher’s salary in a great small town and let us interact and form great friendships with Navajos and Mexicans and blacks and Mormons. They were really ahead of their time,” Budenholzer said. “This is America.”"
"For Curry, a Return Home Shows He Is Where He Belongs - The New York Times","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Stephen Curry was about 25 minutes into a news conference here on Saturday afternoon when a magician who goes by the name Jibrizy sidled up to the dais to do a card trick. Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, seemed impressed.","“That was nice, big fella,” Curry said. “That was crazy. Y’all see that? Did y’all see that? What’s your name, boss? Jibrizy? Nice to meet you, man. Fire. You’re fire. That’s what’s up.”","Lots of weird stuff tends to happen during N.B.A. All-Star weekend, and a cameo by Jibrizy was no exception. But it was also the rare instance when the spotlight left Curry, if only for a moment, in the run-up to the weekend’s flagship game on Sunday.","Curry, a six-time All-Star and two-time most valuable player who has already coaxed Golden State to three championships, is used to lots of attention. But he relished his return to Charlotte, where he grew up to become perhaps the greatest shooter of all time — and where he is still revered.","“From the time I started playing basketball at 5, right down the street at the recreation center, to now, a lot has happened,” Curry said. “A lot of great things.”","Curry was not so great Sunday, but that was not the point. He finished with 17 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists for Team Giannis in a 178-164 loss to Team LeBron in the All-Star Game, which was a defense-free postscript to a weekend that was a Curry family affair.","“Incredibly fond of the family,” Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters. “They seem to be the first family of Charlotte, at least this week.”","For much of his trip home, Curry was accompanied by his father, Dell, who spent 10 seasons playing for the Charlotte Hornets, and his mother, Sonya, who drilled a half-court heave after the family helped refurbish a community center. It was probably the family’s splashiest shot of the weekend.","“I was surprised,” Stephen Curry said, “because the first four she flung underhand, they didn’t make it to the rim. And then that last one, it just looked good from the moment it left her hand, and I was going, ‘Wham, bam, can of ham! That’s going in!’ ”","Curry had less success in Saturday night’s 3-point shootout, where he was joined by his younger brother, Seth, who plays for the Portland Trail Blazers. Stephen Curry made it to the championship round before losing to Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets.","But Curry had also found time to return to Davidson College, his alma mater, where he clambered into the student section to celebrate an 80-72 victory over St. Joseph’s on Friday night.","“The energy in the building was unbelievable,” Curry said. “It’s surreal every time I get to go back there.”","The following afternoon, Curry swayed in a sea of reporters (and at least one magician) as he fielded a wide-ranging mix of questions.","What did it mean to him to be back in Charlotte? “It’s kind of overwhelming to be honest,” he said. “I’ve got to be like the Energizer bunny.”","Could he say something nice to all his fans in the Dominican Republic? “I’ve been there, and I hope to go back,” he said.","Did he have a favorite basketball-themed movie? “Probably ‘Love & Basketball,’ ” he said. “I’m a romantic, bro.”","During warm-ups for Sunday’s game, Curry mimicked a game of volleyball with Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, posted up a ball boy so that he could take an entry pass from Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook, made chitchat with bigwigs who were courtside and jacked his share of 30-footers. Most of them went in. All-Star weekend is a circus, but it is still basketball, after all, and Curry has unique skills.","He is assembling another spectacular season, even if his work has been overshadowed by fellow All-Stars like James Harden of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Thunder and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been so consistently good for so long now — and his team so dominant — that perhaps some of the novelty has worn off. It is unfair, of course.","If his feats feel too familiar, consider his production this season: 28.6 points, 5.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 48.8 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from 3-point range. He missed 11 games with a groin injury but spent part of that time gluing the Warriors’ locker room back together after Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had a big dust-up.","The friction stemmed from Durant’s looming free agency, which has been a steady hum of distraction for the Warriors. But Curry has been a stabilizing force for his team — and even for the league.","With a contract that runs through the 2021-22 season, Curry has not had to face pressing questions about his future. He is committed to the Warriors, and the Warriors appear committed to him. He is a throwback in an era dominated by player movement, the current face of which is Anthony Davis, the All-Star center who recently requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans. So many other stars face uncertain summers, too: Durant, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard among them.","But Curry has his niche in Northern California, even if his roots are in North Carolina. After Sunday’s game, he described trying to persuade his father to move to the Bay Area, where Curry has settled in with his wife, Ayesha, and their three children.","Dell Curry, who is a color commentator for the Hornets, always says no.","“This is where home is for him,” Stephen Curry said.","And for Stephen Curry, the whereabouts of his father seem to be the only player movements on his mind. Curry said he was unconcerned with free agency this summer and the potential departures of his teammates.","“That’s a part of the business,” Curry said. “But the great teams, the great players, they stay in the moment and they understand what’s in front of them.”","And so, after taking a weekend to dip into his past, Curry returned to looking ahead. The journey goes on."
‘High Flying Bird’ Is Rich With Historical References. Here’s a Closer Look. - The New York Times,"Steven Soderbergh’s electrifying new film “High Flying Bird,” which debuted Friday on Netflix, tells the story of a fictional N.B.A. lockout set in the Instagram Age, in which longstanding concerns about money, race and social justice are galvanized by disputes over players’ personal images, and who has the right to control them. (Appropriately, the entire film was shot on an iPhone.)","The film’s dense but fast-moving script, written by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), is also replete with references to the game’s history — not least to the currents of protest and politics that have coursed through pro basketball since it was segregated. There’s a rich subtext here, much of it only hinted at. Below is a spoiler-filled guide.","As in baseball, football and most areas of American life, segregation kept black players out of the white pro basketball leagues, confined to amateur and semipro all-black teams, which formed in schools, churches, community centers and the like. Games were frequently paired with ragtime dances to make for a full evening of entertainment.","The best known of these barnstorming teams, often called “Black Fives” by historians, were the New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Renaissance — or, as they were better known, the Rens — were so impressive that in 1947, Coach Joe Lapchick of the New York Knicks lobbied the Basketball Association of America to admit the team into the young league, a precursor of the National Basketball Association. The owners voted him down. The next year, a competing league, the National Basketball League, brought the team in instead.",[Read the Times review of “High Flying Bird” by A.O. Scott.],"Indirectly. The Rens and the Globetrotters, in particular, were internationally known for their dazzling play, often besting white teams when matched up for exhibition games. The Rens, for example, beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the first integrated tournament championship in 1939; the Globetrotters beat the Minnesota Lakers in a celebrated 1948 exhibition game that The Chicago Tribune pinpointed as key to the integration of the game.","As Spencer (Bill Duke) explains in “High Flying Bird”: “There’s a reason why the N.B.A. started integrating as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions started going international. Control. They wanted the control of a game that we played, and we played better.”","Lapchick, however, did not give up. In 1950, the year after the Basketball Association of America absorbed the smaller National Basketball League and became the N.B.A., he signed Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton, who had played for the Rens and the Globetrotters (as well as in baseball’s Negro leagues), to join the Knicks. That same season, West Virginia State’s Earl Lloyd joined the Washington Capitals and Chuck Cooper was drafted out of Duquesne by the Boston Celtics. (Another black player, Hank DeZonie, played five games with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in December of that season.)","Talking to The Times in 2008, Lloyd told stories of being heckled and spat upon by fans, although the abuse he encountered was “no comparison,” he said, to what Jackie Robinson withstood three years earlier in professional baseball.","Yes — in fact, there were four. (One lasted only a few hours.) In the first dialogue scene of “High Flying Bird,” the sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland) tells a client, “Last time this happened, folks was broke left and right!” That “last time” was the 2011 lockout, which lasted  five months and resulted in the loss of 16 regular-season games, the entire preseason and an estimated $400 million in revenue for team owners and players.","A 10-year deal was announced late that November, which heavily favored owners. It reduced player salaries by nearly $300 million and shifted an estimated $3 billion to the owners over the course of the contract. The truncated 66-game season finally got underway on Christmas Day.","Much screen time in “High Flying Bird” is spent contemplating the legality of public appearances and exhibition games by league-signed players during the lockout. The 2011 lockout was threaded with similar concerns. The film’s fictional team owners grouse over the attention attracted by a “lockout street ball event in Las Vegas,” presumably inspired by the “lockout league” in Vegas, which comprised two weeks of pickup games with more than 70 N.B.A. players in September 2011, according to The Las Vegas Sun. (Profits from ticket sales were donated to charity).","Dozens of players filled the pay gap by picking up spots on teams in Europe and Japan. As The Times’s Howard Beck noted at the time, however, “a vast majority of them are rookies, middling veterans and fringe players.”","As New York magazine and others have noted, the character Myra (Sonja Sohn) strongly resembles Michele Roberts, who became the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association in 2014. The first woman in history to head a major sports union, Roberts made waves from the beginning. A Times profile a few months into her tenure noted that she had already “forcefully questioned the league’s pay model and labeled its entire cadre of owners as replaceable.”","Like the character she inspired, Roberts is a tough-as-nails negotiator who is undaunted by working in a male-dominated world. “My past,” she told players while making her case for the job, “is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.”","In the film’s first scene, Ray gives a client a mysterious package, calling it “the Bible.” It contains the book “The Revolt of the Black Athlete” by the sports sociologist and civil rights advocate Dr. Harry Edwards, who also appears briefly in Ray’s office near the end of the film. Edwards first came to national prominence for organizing the Olympic Project for Human Rights, whose members Tommie Smith and John Carlos made headlines for raising their gloved fists while receiving medals at the 1968 Olympics.","Edwards has spent the ensuing years teaching, writing, consulting and leading protests. “Revolt,” published in 1969, argued that racism is as prevalent in sports as in any other section of society. “The sports world is not a rose flourishing in the middle of a wasteland,” he writes. “It is part and parcel of that wasteland, reeking of the same racism that corrupts other areas of our society.”","“High Flying Bird” is bookended by recordings of two folk-rock classics, both performed by Richie Havens as part of his opening set at Woodstock. The title track, Havens’s recording of a folk song written by Billy Edd Wheeler, was praised by the musicologist Richie Unterberger for its “arresting minor-keyed melody and brooding lyrics, contrasting the freedom of a bird to the singer’s earthbound misery.” It isn’t hard to connect those lyrics to Ray’s notion that his clients should free themselves from the earthbound constraints of the sports industry and bring the game back to its roots.","“Handsome Johnny,” which Havens wrote with the Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr., closes the film, telling the story of a young man who marches off to a series of wars. Given the movie’s themes, the song’s refrain is appropriate: “It’s a long hard road, hey, before we’ll be free.”"
Playoff Mode? LeBron James and the Lakers Are Failing to Activate - The New York Times,LeBron James can’t say that he wasn’t warned. ,"Lots of us were crowing in the summer, and pretty loudly so, about what would greet the unquestioned Lord of the Eastern Conference if he dared to defect. ","Sign with the Los Angeles Lakers if you wish, for the sunnier Hollywood life and all the perks, but brace yourself for the most trying regular season of your career if you decide to go West. ",That was the gist of the scouting report — which in retrospect could not have been much more prescient. ,"On cue: The most daunting and, yes, disappointing season of James’s career is right here, right now, for the biggest name in basketball.",And it appears he will soon have to stomach that it’s going on his ledger in the most permanent ink that he was unable to bring a halt to the longest postseason drought in Lakers history — barring an unforeseen resurrection from a fractured group that sits four and a half games out of a Western Conference playoff berth with 19 games to go.,"No matter how much culpability you wish to assign James for what is poised to go down as the Lakers’ franchise-record sixth successive trip to the draft lottery, he’s going to have to own this as much as the front-office tandem of Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka as well as the under-fire coach Luke Walton.","The LeBron Way, for years and years, has worked something like this: He inevitably gets most of the credit when his team flourishes; his teammates absorb the bulk of the blame when things unravel. But this is different. This would be the jarring sight of James, fresh off his eighth consecutive finals appearance, actually missing out on the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since his second professional season in 2004-5, when he was just 20.","Even though he can rightly point to his recent groin strain as the biggest standings-altering disruption these Lakers have endured, James surely understands that his maiden campaign in Los Angeles is bound to be recorded in many precincts as a failure to make the playoffs that belongs to him.","The Lakers are 4-7 since James returned from the groin injury that sidelined him longer (17 consecutive games) than any previous injury in his 16-year career. They have followed up an unsightly road loss to Atlanta in their final game before the All-Star break with harder-to-rationalize road losses to New Orleans, Memphis and Phoenix since the break.","After Saturday night’s humiliation against a 13-51 Suns team, which dropped the Lakers to 30-33, James’s gang only sports a 1.3-percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to Basketball-Reference.com.","They also have the league’s eighth-toughest remaining schedule, according to Tankathon.com. ","We’ll never know if the Lakers, who had risen to a heady fourth in the West at 20-14 when James sustained the groin injury in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State, could have kept building upon that promising start with a healthy LeBron. But we most certainly do know that James’s mere return to the lineup, at 34, wasn’t enough to rescue a roster that has been assailed since conception for its lack of perimeter shooting and its defensive deficiencies. Nor has he been able to galvanize a locker room that was deeply destabilized by the Lakers’ trade pursuit of the New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, which became all-consuming in late January, and has never recovered. ","It obviously doesn’t help that James, after missing two key free throws in the final minute Saturday, is also converting a substandard 66.9 percent of his attempts from the line to give his critics more handy fodder.","Leaving his home-state Cleveland Cavaliers for the Lakers last July without the accompaniment of a second superstar meant that James, in a far deeper conference, would have little margin for error just to reach the playoffs. When you combine James’s injury absence with the continuing post-Davis malaise and the team’s declining ball movement since Lonzo Ball (ankle) was sidelined six weeks ago, it adds up rather quickly to a margin that is long gone.","The calls for Walton’s dismissal, as they were in January, remain nonsensical. A coaching change now, much like New Orleans’s decision to fire General Manager Dell Demps shortly after the trade deadline, would have no discernible effect on the Lakers’ short-term prospects beyond providing their frustrated fans with a “See? We did something” sacrifice.","The prevailing assumption in league coaching circles remains that Walton will almost certainly be dismissed after the season, followed by the Lakers resuming their trade quest for Davis. But denying Walton an opportunity to at finish out a season wrought with drama and distraction since James’s first dribble in purple and gold would be cruel and needless. ","Changes are coming, though. It’s an open secret that a big off-season reset looms in Lakerland. James always knew that his new club would not be in the title mix until his second campaign as a Laker, but his patience predictably faded quickly — one more reason desperation has become so palpable around this team. ","Many of us know-it-alls in the news media indeed wrote in our preseason forecasts that the playoffs were no certainty for these Lakers, as constructed, but very few of us were actually willing to outright predict that they would miss out. Reason being: It’s not very smart to bet against LeBron Raymone James.","Yet we’ve suddenly reached that unprecedented juncture where it would be wholly irresponsible to advise you that James can extricate himself from this jam just because he’s LeBron. Whether it’s the lingering effects from his groin injury, or his own unmistakably waning spirit in the face of increasingly bleak odds, James has been lacking the zip you associate with his well-chronicled playoff mode — which he assured us on Feb. 21 had been “activated” earlier than usual.","I briefly stood beside James on the floor in Charlotte, N.C., before the All-Star Game tipped off and bought into the idea a surge was coming when he insisted he was eager to embrace “the challenge” of hauling the Lakers out of their hole.","“And I’m getting healthy, too,” James said that night. ","A mere two weeks later, it’s already time to start imagining the N.B.A.’s first spring without King James after watching him for eight straight Junes — and wondering how on Earth he’s going to cope with not being a part of it."
"In a Season of Worsts, the Knicks Are Officially Eliminated - The New York Times",The Knicks will not be going to the N.B.A. playoffs.,"If this doesn’t feel like hot-off-the-presses news, it shouldn’t. You may have checked the standings earlier in the season and seen that the Knicks were 4-10, or 8-20, or 10-40.","With Monday night’s 115-108 loss to the Kings in Sacramento, the Knicks fell to a record of 13-51, the worst in the league. Yes, even worse than the Bulls, the Cavaliers and (shudder) the Suns. The loss also officially eliminated them from a playoff race they were unofficially eliminated from months ago.","The loss, to a team that will probably also miss the playoffs, was hardly mitigated by a good scoring effort by the rookie shooting guard Allonzo Trier, who had 29 points.","The Knicks are last in the league in shooting percentage and last in assists. So, in short, they can’t pass and they can’t shoot. Basketball Reference reports that they are particularly bad at the easiest type of shot, shooting only .603 from three feet or closer and .348 from three to 10 feet, both worst in the league.",The rookie center Mitchell Robinson is fifth in the league in blocks and third in blocks per game. That’s good. But no other Knick is in the top five in anything. That’s not good.,"When you don’t have a lot of wins, you wind up with some losing streaks. It’s just math. The Knicks came into the new year with an eight-game, a six-game and a couple of five-game skids, as one might expect. More unexpected: In January and February, the Knicks lost 18 in a row.","On the plus side, the Knicks have put together two winning streaks. One was two games and the other was three.","The Knicks have now missed the playoffs for six straight years, just short of the franchise record. From 1960 to 1966, the Knicks missed the playoffs seven straight times. But those Knicks teams always won at least 21 games in that span. This season, the Knicks are on a pace to win 16 or 17 games, giving them a chance to break the franchise-worst record of 17 in the abysmal 2014-15 season.","Knicks fans, desperate for a light at the end of the 82-game tunnel, are already focusing on the coming draft lottery, right Spike Lee? Zion Williamson, Duke’s dominant center, is the big prize. Adding Williamson and a couple of free agents lured by the bright lights of New York may finally bring the postseason back to Madison Square Garden.","Unfortunately for the Knicks, the rules have been changed some this year, and having the very worst record does not offer any advantage. The three worst teams, one of whom is virtually certain to be the Knicks, all will have an identical 14 percent chance of landing the top pick. If the Knicks really are tanking to get a lower lottery spot, they can probably stop now."
The Luckiest Team in the Country Needs a Little More - The New York Times,"GREENSBORO, N.C. — As advanced statistical analysis and its attendant new technology continue to reshape how sports are understood, watched and even played — when to punt on fourth down in football, where to position a baseball team’s infielders and how to build a winning basketball team — these new numbers also create a vexing problem:",How to account for what complex algorithms cannot explain.,"The thirst for information is such that one essential set of college basketball data that will help determine the field for this month’s N.C.A.A. tournament, Ken Pomeroy’s eponymous KenPom ratings, includes a metric to shed light on when things do not actually go by the numbers.",Pomeroy has a rather analog term for it: luck.,"“Luck is basically performance in close games,” Pomeroy said. “People generally don’t like the term ‘luck’ — that’s the feedback I get. Technically, I’d call it ‘randomness’ or something a lot more wordy, but that doesn’t fit well above a column.”","In short, KenPom’s luck factor considers the difference between a team’s record and what the data would expect it to be. If a team’s record is better than its predictive numbers, it is lucky. If it is worse, then it is unlucky.","This season, according to the KenPom ratings, no team among the 353 Division I college men’s basketball programs has been luckier than the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.","The Spartans resemble a team one might expect from a coach, Wes Miller, who transferred to North Carolina as a walk-on, then earned a letter on a national championship team and eventually a spot in the starting lineup. They are resourceful and determined, and have the ethos (and the recruiting budget) of an underdog.","Greensboro has a 28-6 record — the best in program history — and finished second in the Southern Conference, behind Wofford, which was ranked 20th in this week’s Associated Press poll.",Did luck have something to do with it?,"Miller, pulling up a folding chair before a recent practice, reacted as one might expect. He praised Pomeroy as “a genius,” expressed fascination with analytics and said there were others on his staff who delve deeper into the data to provide the most salient information about the Spartans and their opponents.",Then he assumed a defensive stance.,"“I’m not a mathematician,” he said. “I’m a basketball coach who’s always trying to figure out an edge to help me coach better. But there’s never been anybody that could put a number on will and togetherness of group.","“There’s something that’s happening in our games that’s indescribable to his data that’s getting us over the hump,” Miller added. “That’s toughness. That’s the ability to win close games. The proudest I ever am as a coach is when we have an awful shooting game or we have an awful offensive game and things don’t go our way and we still find a way because our team was able to dig down and figure out a way to get over the hump.”","Francis Alonso, a senior guard from Malaga, Spain, who is the heartbeat of his team, put it another way: “There’s this saying — it’s champions’ luck.”","Alan Castel, a psychology professor at U.C.L.A. who studies memory and metacognition — how we think about our thinking — said that while confidence (or the lack of it) is a fundamental element of athletic competition, it is often misplaced.","“The human mind doesn’t rely on big data,” said Castel, whose research has debunked the hot-hand theory — the belief that a team should get the ball to a shooter who is on a hot streak. “We’re prone to rely on illusions and small sample sizes and what we want to think.”","If Greensboro’s Spartans are the luckiest team in the country, he said, they deserve some of the credit for it.","“To be lucky, you need to put yourself in a situation,” Castel said. “To win the lottery, you need to buy a ticket.”","Or, he added, to win the N.C.A.A. tournament, you need to get in. And to do that, the Spartans almost certainly will require a little more luck.","Some years ago, a résumé like the Spartans’ might have looked glossier. They have a sparkling record, are 7-0 in games decided by 5 points or fewer and have been competitive in defeats at 10th-ranked Louisiana State (97-91) and sixth-ranked Kentucky (78-61), a game that they led with less than nine minutes left. But they lost to Wofford twice in the regular season — by 29 and 30 points — and for a third time on Monday night, 70-58, in the Southern Conference tournament championship game.","Yet it is this profile — a team that has squeaked past bad teams, competed against good ones and been pounded only twice, by the best team in its conference — that explains why Greensboro’s luck factor is +.175, which, if it holds until the season is over, would be the highest of any team since 2013.","What that figure means, Pomeroy said, is that in a luck-free environment, the Spartans’ winning percentage would be 0.175 lower than it is. As a result, they would have six fewer victories — and a 22-12 record — without any luck.","There are real-world consequences: Through Tuesday’s games, Greensboro ranked 81st in KenPom’s overall ratings, lagging behind East Tennessee State (71st) and Furman (55th), against whom they combined to win four of five games this season. (The N.C.A.A.’s new NET metric, which the tournament selection committee is using to evaluate teams this year, is only slightly kinder: It has the Spartans 58th.)","Once the N.C.A.A. tournament begins next week, with a broad spectrum of schools from around the country, a clearer picture will emerge of whether teams that have been deemed to have enjoyed metric good fortune have punched above their weight all season.","The Spartans, at this point, would consider themselves lucky to have the chance."
The Legend of Zion - The New York Times,"Zion Williamson’s legend grows with every game these days, with each new thundering dunk and every stunning new feat of elevation. It has been this way for several years now, with Williamson the featured actor in a growing collection of viral clips that show a player with the skills to outrun almost anyone, to catch almost anything, to challenge almost anybody. Even his lowest moments — the sneaker that couldn’t hold him, the injured knee that cost him five games — have somehow morphed into highlights. But Williamson, an 18-year-old Duke freshman, has been making memorable moments for years. A group of New York Times reporters tracked down some of the people who were present for a few of them, to ask them about the memories that stand out the most.",Forgive Tom Konchalski.,"The publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated first observed Zion Williamson in person at the Elite 24, an all-star showcase for the nation’s top prep prospects, on Aug. 20, 2016. The court at Pier 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park was the stage, and Williamson was 10 for 10 from the field, scored 23 points and shared most valuable player honors. Konchalski was impressed.","To Konchalski’s well-trained eye — in five decades he had amassed an inventory of reports that stretched from Michael Jordan to LeBron James — Williamson, who had just turned 16, appeared to be an interior technician, a player at ease turning on his defender to make it to the rim for understated finishes. Because of Williamson’s body type, Konchalski considered him a left-handed Jamal Mashburn, a reference to the beefy Bronx product who played 11 seasons in the N.B.A.","When Konchalski sat down at his typewriter after the Elite 24 to describe Williamson’s effort, he wrote that the “6-foot-5 junior Zion Williamson, the master of quiet domination, provided a bit of fresh air.”","Looking back, Konchalski says now, he got it all wrong.","“I’m wiping off copious amounts of egg from my face,” he said. Williamson, he knows, “is anything but quiet.” ","The first time LeBron James showed up to watch Zion Williamson, they wouldn’t let him in the door.","It was July 2017, and James, once a transcendent teenage talent himself, went to see Williamson, the next big thing, at a showcase in Las Vegas. Williamson’s team, South Carolina Supreme, was playing Big Baller Brand, which featured LaMelo Ball, a brother of Lakers guard Lonzo Ball. It was, by summer youth basketball standards, a must-see event.","James, of course, wasn’t the only one interested in that confluence of basketball stardust. The N.B.A. players Damian Lillard, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Murray and Thon Maker were in the gym by the time James arrived, adding buzz to a crowd of more than 4,000 that threatened to swamp a court configured to hold less than half that many.","Even in warm-ups, the excitement was palpable. The fans oohed and aahed as Williamson tossed balls high in the air and dunked them; many spectators held cellphones, the better to share video clips of a scene that was quickly called the “craziest A.A.U. game ever.” ","But James never saw any of it. With fans standing a dozen deep, nearly spilling onto the court from every direction, he and his group were told that just letting him into the gym constituted a security risk. A teenager’s mere presence, it seemed, had squeezed out basketball’s biggest star. James was told he couldn’t come in.","“We shut him down,” an Adidas marketing executive told CBS Sports at the time. “The corners were 500 deep. That’s where it got insane.” ","It would be a year and a half before James got to see Williamson play in person. In February, he took a 35-minute flight from Philadelphia to Charlottesville, Va., and watched from courtside as Williamson, playing for Duke, went for 18 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a win against Virginia. Williamson’s athleticism, James declared, was “ridiculous.” ","Bishop Richardson was averaging about three alley-oop assists to Williamson every game when their team, Spartanburg (S.C.) Day School, arrived at Ben Lippen School in Columbia, S.C., for a game during Williamson’s junior year. ","Williamson dunked a lot back then, and he had recorded at least two slams in the first half that had the gym rocking. “I remember it vividly,” Williamson said last week. “Their student section was really into the game, talking a lot.”","The real highlight, though, was still to come. With Spartanburg ahead by 39 points, Richardson, a spindly guard who had played varsity since the eighth grade, found himself jogging easily up the right sideline when he spotted Williamson closing menacingly down the other side of the court. He tried another lob; he knew the pass didn’t have to be perfect.","“If you threw it anywhere near the rim,” Richardson said, “he was going to get it.” ","On this occasion, Richardson’s toss arrived well below the rim. But that enabled Williamson to do something outrageous: He rose into the air, reached out with two hands to grab the incoming pass at about shoulder height, and — still rising, now high enough to peer inside the rim he was about to shake — used one sweeping, circular motion to bring the ball down to his waist and then back up to the left side of his body before ramming it through the basket with his left hand.",The crowd erupted. ,"“I remember thinking, ‘Holy cow, I’ve never seen anyone do anything like that, let alone be a part of it,’” Richardson said. “People were falling out of the bleachers.”","The dunk made it onto highlight reels and national sports shows within hours, but Richardson did not see a replay until the next day, when he and teammates sneaked a peek in a study hall.","“I wish I could take credit for it,” Richardson said, “but it was completely accidental.” ","Vertical leap is measured using a simple contraption: a tall pole with a series of long, metal fingers that project horizontally from it on top of one another — narrow wings stacked up, up, up, at consistent increments. It may seem lo-fi, but it is also foolproof: Your vertical reach while jumping is the highest metal flange you are able to bat away from its set position. Subtract standing vertical reach from that number, and you have a player’s vertical leap. ","When Duke put its players through the test one day last summer, Zion Williamson’s vertical leap was measured at 46 inches. But to the teammates and Duke staff members who were present, mere numbers do not do the moment justice.","“We were all in shock,” the sophomore guard Alex O’Connell said. ","Williamson, who went last, was off the charts. On his first attempt, he casually swatted aside the highest measurement. A staff member adjusted the pole to its highest setting and reset the tabs, and Williamson repeated the feat. They put weights under the contraption to lift it a few more inches into the air. Williamson batted the highest measurements aside again. ","“It was something you don't see a lot, especially with a guy who is built like him flying through the air,” forward Javin DeLaurier said. “It's a sight to behold.”","Nolan Smith, an assistant coach who played for four years at Duke and several more in the N.B.A. and Europe, said he had never seen anything like it. Cam Reddish, another Blue Devils’ freshman, said he missed out; he said he was in another part of the building when Williamson tested the test itself. ","“I just heard that he broke the record,” Reddish said. “Zion things.”","In the beginning, the former Duke standout Jay Williams kept track of the Williamson hype the same way everybody else did: through low-quality video clips shot in high school gyms and then posted on the internet. Williamson’s high-flying plays quickly became “the eighth wonder of the world,” Williams said.",Then he saw him in person. ,"“I have never seen a player casually do a 360 in a game,” Williams said of seeing Williamson do precisely that in a game against Clemson this season. “Even when you saw Vince do it in college,” he said, referring to Vince Carter, who played at the University of North Carolina, “there was a level of oomph that he needed to exert that type of energy. My man casually did it in the game. He did a 360 like I would do a layup.”",Williams said plays like that one were the reason comparing Williamson to other basketball players is a mistake. ,"“To me, I was looking at a football player who had the finesse of basketball ability,” he said. “I’ve never seen that before. I played against Julius Peppers in college. I remember him being the only guy Carlos Boozer was somewhat intimidated to go against because he couldn’t just move him around. I remember thinking for the first time: ‘Oh, I was looking at Julius Peppers but through a basketball lens. What? What?’ Julius was agile, but I am talking about the frame of the body. It reminded me of a linebacker or a tight end. Just different.” ","Spike Lee was in his seat and Barack Obama was settled in his, down past the end of the Duke bench. But in front of North Carolina’s Luke Maye — in the space where Zion Williamson had stood a moment earlier — there was suddenly … nothing. ","“I didn’t hear anything, man,” Maye said Thursday. ",What everyone quickly realized was that the story had quickly changed from a heated rivalry game — top-ranked Duke vs. No. 8 North Carolina — into something far more bizarre: Williamson’s Nike sneaker had broken apart as he made a move at the free-throw line. He was down. North Carolina was racing upcourt. And everyone else was asking: What just happened? ,"Maye, in that moment, had the best seat in the house. ","“I just took the ball,” he said, “and just started going.”","Initially, the Blue Devils were just as confused. The first thing Duke’s Javin DeLaurier saw from his spot on the bench was the sneaker on Williamson’s left foot, or what was left of it, anyway: Its sole was flapping free, like a banner in the wind.","To DeLaurier, this counted as good news.","“I was like, ‘Oh, no, it’s just his shoe,’” he said. “There was a sigh of relief.”","He had, after all, seen this before. He had blown out a shoe before. He had seen Williamson do it, too. “Zion’s a big human being, moving pretty fast, changing direction,” DeLaurier said. “It happens.”","“I consider it my fault,” De’Andre Hunter says now.","He’s not wrong. Late in a February game at Virginia, Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy whipped the ball crosscourt to his teammate De’Andre Hunter, who waited at the 3-point line, deep in the corner, and without a Duke player within 15 feet of him. Williamson was on the left side of the court, playing his usual feisty, active defense, so Hunter, in the right corner, took his time uncoiling the 3-point attempt.","Williamson, though, had closed the gap by then. Soaring across the court with five quick steps, he took off from about six feet away just as Hunter unloaded. “I consider it my fault,” Hunter said. “I took way too long setting it up and releasing the shot. But he came a long way.” ","In fact, Williamson jumped so high and stretched so vertically that his right hand was well above the height of the 10-foot rim when he cleanly swatted Hunter’s shot into the stands. ","“He just came out of nowhere,” Hunter said. ","Worse news, at least for Hunter, was that the clip made its way to ESPN’s “SportsCenter” and other highlight shows, and it is now a staple of the Williamson YouTube filmography. ","“I didn’t know it was going to be such a big deal,” Hunter said recently."
Play About LeBron James to Highlight New Steppenwolf Season - The New York Times,"There is a good chance that LeBron James might not be playing basketball in June of 2020, barring a big free agent signing or a trade. But someone will be onstage discussing him.","“King James,” a play by Rajiv Joseph, will be making its world premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in May 2020, the Steppenwolf announced on Thursday as part of its 2019- 2020 lineup announcement, a diverse slate with a particular emphasis on people of color. Anna D. Shapiro will direct.","The show will depict life in Cleveland after 2016, when the Cavaliers won the championship, as two friends “spar in a verbal game of one-on-one, revealing past secrets, present truths, and a possible future after ‘The King’ has left the building.” (Last summer, Mr. James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers.) The play will also be produced on the West Coast in Los Angeles, where Mr. James currently resides, as part of the Center Theatre Group’s 2020- 2021 season.","Other highlights from Steppenwolf’s upcoming season include the debut of “Lindiwe,” a musical featuring works by the famed South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo (Nov. 7-Dec. 29, 2019). Tracy Letts, a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winner, will bring his play “Bug” to Chicago, which is slated to be directed by David Cromer (“The Band’s Visit”) and star Carrie Coon (“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, HBO’s “The Leftovers”) and Namir Smallwood (Jan. 23-March 8, 2020).","Lauren Yee’s “The Great Leap,” which last year was at the Atlantic Theater Company’s Stage II in New York, will make a leap of its own to Chicago.

LeBron James Was Supposed to Make the Lakers Great. But When? - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — Kyle Kuzma had his first interaction with LeBron James a little more than a year ago, when Kuzma was a first-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and James was a few months from dragging the Cleveland Cavaliers to another appearance in the N.B.A. finals. Kuzma had reached out by phone, hoping for some tips.","“Just wanted to see how one of the greats takes care of his body and has so much longevity,” Kuzma recalled this week in an interview. “Everybody wants to play basketball for as long as possible.”","So much has changed since that initial conversation. Kuzma and James are teammates now, and Kuzma is experiencing the unique challenges that come with playing alongside one of the game’s behemoths. At the same time, James’s body finally betrayed him this season, which has only heightened the sense of urgency within the organization: The Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for five years running, are not in position for a patient rebuild.","James, at 34, may still be in his prime, but the stakes are already high for a franchise that desperately wants to maximize his time in Los Angeles. And while neither James nor Lakers management has shown much enthusiasm for coaxing along a young core — the Lakers tried to ship half the roster to New Orleans last week — they are stuck in this together. James was supposed to be the savior of a flagship franchise gone astray; salvaging the final months of this year would be a key indicator that he still wields that type of power.","“We have to approach the rest of the season just like you would during the playoffs,” Kuzma said.","As Kuzma recalled his talk with James, he had no way of knowing that the Lakers were mere hours from suffering one final implosion before the N.B.A. All-Star break — a 117-113 loss to the Atlanta Hawks that left the team with a losing record and ample opportunity for soul searching.","“It’s time for us to get away and reflect a little bit about where we are as a group,” Coach Luke Walton said. “I think this first part of the season, we’ve gone through a lot of adversity. And we’re probably not where we want to be, but we’re still close enough.”","Close enough, that is, for vying for a spot in the playoffs, which was both an indication of the team’s modest goals and its sad reality. At 28-29, the Lakers are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings. It is unfamiliar territory for James, who has not been on a losing team this late in a season since he was a first-year forward with the Cavaliers.","“But with LeBron on your team, anything is possible,” said Mychal Thompson, a power forward for the Showtime-era Lakers and an analyst for the team’s radio broadcasts. “I mean, look at some of the teams he’s taken to the finals — including last season. He’s capable of doing great things if you just get on board and run with him.”","The Lakers, though, seem fragile after nearly five months of drama — all of it stemming directly or indirectly from the $154 million deal that James signed to join the team last summer. The pressure was on from the start, and little has gone according to plan.","“There’s been more noise this year,” Walton said, “but that was to be expected with the moves in the off-season. That was something to be anticipated.”","Where to begin? Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo were suspended for trying to brawl with the Houston Rockets two games into the season. Magic Johnson, the team’s outspoken president of basketball operations, chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting for the team’s slow start, igniting lasting questions about Walton’s job security. Nearly every player on the roster has been injured, and that includes James, who missed 17 games with a strained groin.","And lest we forget: Last week, Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka tried to trade away nearly half the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans for Anthony Davis, who, before the start of the season, hired the same agent who represents James. It was the clearest sign yet that Johnson is willing to attempt the very boldest moves — no matter the residual damage.","Consider that the Lakers, amid their ultimately fruitless effort to pry Davis away from the Pelicans, lost by 42 points to the Indiana Pacers. And with rumors of which Lakers would be traded swirling through social media, it was difficult to find arguments in their defense — even from James himself.","Kuzma, who was offered up as one of the pieces in a potential deal, said it had been difficult to drown out the noise.","“It’s definitely tough,” he said, “because this generation, you’re always on your phone, always on social media, always seeing it somewhere on TV.”","But the trade deadline passed, and the roster more or less remained intact. There had been a sense that a surprising win against the Boston Celtics on Feb. 7 would galvanize the team in the wake of so much uncertainty. And even after losing to the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, the Lakers still had a chance to build some momentum against the Hawks on Tuesday.","Before the game, James appeared to be in an upbeat mood. In the locker room, he knelt on a giant inflatable ball as he worked on some core-strengthening exercises. He crooned the lyrics to “Plug Walk” by the hip-hop artist Rich the Kid. He made small talk with Ingram. It was all vintage James.","About three hours later, once the Lakers had punctuated their loss with a turnover, James made a beeline off the court and into the tunnel. He was practically steaming. He had finished with his fifth triple-double of the season — 28 points, 16 assists, 11 rebounds — but the Lakers’ defense was as porous as a coffee filter, and the result was just as messy.","“I can throw that game in the trash,” James said.","In a three-minute postgame session with reporters, Kuzma mentioned the concept of “fun” five times — specifically, the notion that the Lakers were not having much of it.","“A lot of times we’re out there with sad faces, very focused faces,” Kuzma said. “But I think we’re at our best when we’re having fun.”","Fun may not be the primary objective for James, and the psychic effects of the loss are sure to linger until at least Feb. 21, when their season will resume after the All-Star break with a home game against the Houston Rockets. For now, though, the best thing for these players may be to be away from each other for a while, which was one of Walton’s suggestions before they parted for the break.","“Spend some time by yourself,” he said, and added: “I think we’ve got a group that will be ready by the time we get back.”"
The Celtics Really Need Jayson Tatum to Soar Again - The New York Times,"BOSTON — Jayson Tatum boomed on LeBron James in last year’s N.B.A. playoffs. You may remember it. Tatum, the 21-year-old swingman for the Boston Celtics, certainly does.","The dunk drew a “wow” from the play-by-play broadcaster Mike Breen. A reporter wrote on Twitter that in the locker room afterward, he overheard James saying that Tatum had “boomed” him, before James repeated four times, “He’s so good.”","“I’ve got a big-ass picture of it in my house,” Tatum said in a post-practice interview on Tuesday.","The dunk came in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of last year’s Eastern Conference finals. Starting from outside the 3-point line, Tatum took two dribbles with his left hand to get to the rim before hammering a right-handed dunk past James, who attempted a block as a helpless defender. Tatum followed the booming with a chest bump of James, one of his boyhood idols, as if to say, “I’m here.”","The Celtics lost that game, but the dunk solidified Tatum, who played one season at Duke, as an emerging N.B.A. star.","After the Celtics’ disappointing regular-season run this season, Tatum’s star hasn’t been as bright so far in these playoffs as Boston faces the Indiana Pacers in the first round. He did not make the leap many thought he would: While he improved as a rebounder and passer, his shot selection led to more long 2-pointers, causing his true shooting percentage to dip from .586 in his rookie campaign to .547 this year, placing him below .560, the league average.","He increased his frequency of midrange jumpers but decreased his accuracy in making them: 37 percent, down from 44 percent. Many of his advanced metric statistics, including win shares per 48 minutes, value over replacement player and box plus/minus, were worse this year.","Tatum finds himself in an unusual spot, compared with fellow N.B.A. sophomores like Utah’s Donovan Mitchell and Philadelphia’s Ben Simmons. The better Tatum plays, especially in this postseason, the more likely he is to be linked to trade rumors, particularly those involving Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans’ star who has requested a trade that could shift the competitive balance in the N.B.A.","Several college starters in this year’s Final Four were older than Tatum. But if he cannot live up to the hype he created in last year’s playoffs — that is, if he becomes just another guard — the Pelicans may be more likely to accept a package from the Los Angeles Lakers or another team besides Boston. At the same time, if Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving opts for free agency this summer, the future of the franchise may rest on Tatum’s shoulders. At barely 21, he’d be the alpha.","Tatum’s future is more uncertain than many other players who have received significant early acclaim. But one way or another, the Celtics need Tatum to be great. Not just for this year’s playoffs, but for the future.","In short, they need him to boom.","In a conversation at the Celtics’ practice facility about his future and the atypical stakes, Tatum had talking points at the ready, ones that he had delivered multiple times before. He stared straight ahead, not making eye contact, as if he were running through the script in his head.","“Trade rumors don’t bother me,” he said in his deep monotone. “They’re talking about trading me for guys like Anthony Davis. So, I mean, I must be doing something pretty well.” When pressed on whether this bothered him, he didn’t budge: “I love the game of basketball. Being traded is part of the game. I’ll play for whomever. It’s something I can’t control.”","He didn’t have much more to say than that. But that is Tatum’s personality, Brad Stevens, the Celtics’ head coach, said. No distractions. That, Stevens said, is his best quality.","“Circumstances don’t affect him,” Stevens said. “First game of the season, he’s unaffected by the jitters that everybody has. Seventh game of a playoff series? Unaffected. At least, he shows himself to be unaffected, and he can thrive in that environment.”","Stevens said Tatum’s quality of play improved as he got deeper into the season. He became a better passer, averaging 2.8 assists after the All-Star break, compared with 1.9 before. But his shooting dipped, from 38 percent from deep before the break to 35 percent afterward.","Last season, Tatum benefited from the low expectations for the Celtics after injuries to Irving, forward Gordon Hayward and the reserve center Daniel Theis. But he also helped carry Boston to within one win of an unlikely N.B.A. finals appearance. This year, “unlikely” is not in the playoff vocabulary. The Celtics are supposed to get there. And Boston’s fans, never the most positive bunch, can turn on a player in a second. If the Celtics do not advance, after many analysts predicted they would, fans may view Tatum’s season in a harsh light, given how much of the franchise’s fortunes are tied up with him.","Tatum said he was not as nervous about the playoffs this time around. Taking a daily pregame nap with his 16-month-old son has helped. The early returns have been positive: In the first game of the series against the Pacers, Tatum scored 15 points on 11 shots. He was plus-11 in 34 minutes as the Celtics ran away with a win.",But there hasn’t been a highlight that has matched the dunk on James. Tatum shook his head no when asked if he had ever talked to James about that play. A hint of a grin betrayed his practiced demeanor.,"“They won so they got the last laugh,” Tatum said."
"With the Playoffs Out of Sight, What’s Left for the Lakers? - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES — To celebrate their first home win in 25 days, the Lakers on Sunday dropped streamers that had been collecting dust from the ceiling at Staples Center. The final lineup of the night included Alex Caruso, a 25-year-old guard who spent most of the season in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League.","Caruso knows things were not supposed to be this way. His mere presence — in a crunchtime situation, no less — was a vivid sign that the season had gone sideways for the Lakers, who will be watching the playoffs from various vacation destinations.","Caruso also knows that the Lakers are playing fairly meaningless games, including Sunday’s 111-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (32-41) have nine more of these to go, starting Tuesday against the Washington Wizards. The buzz of LeBron James’s first season as a Laker is gone. The roster will be overhauled again this summer as the franchise, which has not been to the playoffs since 2013, rummages for solutions.","“But for me,” Caruso said, “these games are really meaningful.”","The Lakers are searching for motivation wherever they can find it, especially as they head toward an off-season of uncertainty. Coach Luke Walton’s job status is tenuous at best, and 10 players on the current roster do not have guaranteed deals for next season. Some of them, like Caruso, are trying to showcase their skills in hopes of acquiring N.B.A. work next season.","“I think this little stretch has been really good,” Caruso said, “because it’s finally allowed me to put all that work I’ve put in over the last two years and show how much I’ve evolved as a player. That I’m gaining confidence and making strides to get better and better.” In 16 appearances for the Lakers this season, Caruso has shot 44.6 percent from the field, averaging 6 points and 2.2 rebounds.","Even players who figure to be a part of the franchise’s future are focusing on personal growth. A team is always a collection of individuals, but the Lakers’ late-season emphasis on “me” is particularly understandable.","“I need to use these games to develop myself and play with the ball more,” the second-year forward Kyle Kuzma said recently.",The Lakers were not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 17 — that would happen five days later — but Kuzma stood by his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immediate future.,"“I’m just trying to use these last 13, 14 games — whatever we have — to just try to develop good habits,” he said. “Season’s pretty much over, so that’s the only thing I can really do. Everyone knows I’m a good scorer and I can do that. I’m just trying to complete my game.”","Then there are the injured players who have largely disappeared from view: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart. For them, the end of this season is about rehabbing for the next one.","After all the losses, injuries and general dysfunction, Walton continues to preach the importance of team play. Same as ever.","“It starts with our effort and how we play and how we compete,” he said. “And our guys have been doing a nice job of that, even though we haven’t been winning games. Whatever lineups we’ve been putting out there, they’re giving what they have. So that’s the No. 1 thing.”","As for James, these are his first truly inconsequential games since his rookie season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who finished well out of playoff contention. But even then, he could use the end of the season as an opportunity to hone his abilities and gain experience for future endeavors — such as eight consecutive trips to the N.B.A. Finals.","So it is a credit to James, even as the grease fire of his first season with the Lakers smolders, that he is out there — trying. Against the Kings, he finished with his 81st career triple-double: 29 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds. How does he sustain the motivation?","“If he’s out there on the court, he’s going to give what he has,” Walton said. “That’s probably a better question for him, but I’m getting to know him, and that’s the type of person he is: He respects and loves the game. So if he’s going to play, he’s going to give what he has.”",James said he appreciated the fans who continued to show up. He also said he owed it to himself to play with genuine effort.,"“I’ve always respected the basketball gods,” James said, “and if I’m on the floor, I got to try to play as hard as I can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game.”","Still, times have changed for the Lakers, who have not been to the playoffs since 2013. Before that, they routinely fixated on the Western Conference standings and the number of wins they would need to make the playoffs. Now, the most important number in their universe is 3 percent — as in, their odds of winning the N.B.A. draft lottery.","Then again, the Lakers are not the only team that has so little at stake at this stage of the season. Look no further than the Kings, whose push for a playoff berth has deteriorated in recent weeks. Before Sunday’s game, Coach Dave Joerger held a brief news conference. No one had much to ask.","“I can give you some more stuff,” he said. “I mean, it’s sunny out. It’s spring. It smells like March Madness, Lent and the N.B.A. playoffs. Get the seedings, get it done. Exciting times.”",He paused again.,“Nothing else?” he asked.,Nothing else.
N.C.A.A. Appeals Latest Antitrust Ruling - The New York Times,The N.C.A.A. said on Saturday that it was appealing a Federal District Court’s decision this month that barring athletes from being paid beyond a scholarship and related costs violated antitrust law.,"“We believe, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that N.C.A.A. member schools and conferences are best positioned to strengthen and revise their rules to better support student-athletes, rather than forcing these issues into continuous litigation,” Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, said in a statement.","Remy said the decision to appeal, by the N.C.A.A. and the major college conferences named as defendants in the suit, was unanimous.","The ruling this month by Judge Claudia Wilken in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California was actually far more favorable to the N.C.A.A. than the plaintiffs, a class of Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and football players, had hoped.","The suit, known as Alston after a lead plaintiff, argued that the N.C.A.A.’s rules barring payments to players — the center of what the association terms the collegiate model, and what is broadly known as amateurism — was illegal collusion. It asked the court to declare as much, and to eliminate all such rules, leaving it up to individual conferences to set caps independently if they so chose.","Instead, while Judge Wilken agreed that the rules were illegal, she found that an alternative, in which the N.C.A.A. continued to restrict payments unless they were tied to education, was acceptable. Under her ruling, colleges could give athletes items like computers, but the N.C.A.A. could continue to bar them from receiving cash in express exchange for their athletic contributions.","Judge Wilken cited a 2015 ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a similar case, in which a three-judge panel partially insisted that payment to athletes be “tethered to education.” The same appellate court — albeit probably three different judges — would hear this appeal.","While the N.C.A.A. largely welcomed Judge Wilken’s finding when it was handed down, it said on Saturday that it sought more: to get the courts out of regulating college athletics as much as possible.","“While the district court upheld the distinction between full-time students who play college sports and professional athletes, it erred by giving itself authority to micromanage decisions about education-related support,” Remy said.","Jeffrey Kessler, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of the appeal in a text message on Saturday morning: “We are not surprised. It was a major defeat for the N.C.A.A.”"
"Russell Westbrook, Paul George and ... Jeff Ruland? The Triple-Double Through Time - The New York Times","It was a humble TV listing, informing readers that the Knicks would be playing the Washington Bullets on MSG that night. The short item noted that “The Knicks tried double-teaming Jeff Ruland in the second of those games, but the tactic didn’t work: He responded with a triple double-digit effort — 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.”","It was Dec. 29, 1984. And for the very first time, The New York Times had cited the triple-double.","On Monday night, Russell Westbrook completed an unprecedented 10th consecutive triple-double, with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Portland Trail Blazers. Westbrook broke the record of nine, set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1968.","But while triple-doubles are no longer uncommon — Westbrook’s teammate Paul George turned in an even more immpressive line (47 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists) on Monday — the term is relatively new. Like Chamberlain, some of the greatest practitioners made every one of their triple-doubles when triple-doubles were not even a thing.","The Times quickly embraced the triple-double. Two days after its debut, the label made it into an ordinary sports article, this time without the clunky words “digit” or “effort.” Precedent had been set.","In those early days, some of the references to triple-double in The Times were in quotes, as if editors were afraid that the new term would pollute the newspaper’s august pages. Eventually the arbiters of style settled on no quotes, and a hyphen in between the two words.","The first triple-double in Basketball-Reference’s database is from 1950, when Andy Phillip of the Philadelphia Warriors tallied 17 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, although there were almost certainly others before that when stat keeping was less precise and complete.","Harvey Pollack, the longtime 76ers stats guru, is generally credited with inventing the term in the early 1980s, inspired by Magic Johnson, who made a habit of triple-doubling. (Ruland, though he was the Times’s triple-double pioneer, claimed only five in his career.)","There are also double-doubles — the career record is held by Chamberlain — and quadruple doubles, for those who can also manage 10 blocks or steals. That has only happened a handful of times in the N.B.A., and not since David Robinson in 1994.","There are even quintuple doubles, a stupefying exploit — 25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals and 10 blocks — performed by the women’s star Tamika Catchings when she was in high school in 1997.","Westbrook has taken the triple-double to new heights, though, actually averaging a triple-double for the last two seasons. He is on pace to do so again this season. And unlike his early predecessors, he is keenly aware of the stat, often looking to add that one more assist or rebound that he needs late in a game.","Westbrook now has 127 total triple-doubles, closing in on Johnson, the inspiration for the term, who has 138.","But above all of them is Oscar Robertson, the only other man to average a triple-double; he had 181 in his Hall of Fame career.","His last one came in 1974, when the feat was still unnamed, at least in The Times."
"LeBron James Is Hurt. Step Forward, Kyle Kuzma. - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES — At the midpoint of the N.B.A. season, Kyle Kuzma was daydreaming about something the Lakers have yet to unveil: a small-ball lineup with LeBron James manning the center position. The Lakers already generate the third-highest pace in the league using a traditional lineup, so imagine the possibilities.","“That small-ball lineup is going to be huge for us,” Kuzma told reporters on Wednesday morning, “especially in the playoffs when everybody’s going to be going small.”","Kuzma, a second-year forward, was making two assumptions: first, that the Lakers would make the playoffs, and second, that they would have enough time to experiment with the lineup and refine it ahead of a hypothetical trip to the postseason. Not to stamp all over Kuzma’s enthusiasm, but neither of those is a guarantee given the way the Lakers’ hodgepodge season has gone.","Coach Luke Walton, to his credit, is taking a more pragmatic approach. Though he entered the season hoping to unleash a smaller lineup that could cause mismatch problems, the Lakers do not have time to mess around with experiments, he said, not right now, not after their recent struggles, not with their continuing rash of injuries and absences.","“It’s going to get tougher to do,” Walton said, adding: “As the season gets further and further down the road, those, ‘Hey, let’s try this during the game’ — it’s going to be less and less because we’re in a pretty nasty fight for who gets in and who’s not in. So it will be more about what we’re good at, and try to get better and better at that.”","Every team copes with injuries of varying magnitudes, and the Lakers have dealt with their share. On Wednesday night, LeBron James — no longer indestructible, apparently — missed his eighth consecutive game with a strained left groin, but he looked upbeat on the home bench at Staples Center during his team’s 113-100 victory against the Detroit Pistons.","“I thought our team showed a lot of growth from, however you want to call it, the post-LeBron injury,” said Walton, whose team improved to 23-19.","An important caveat: The Pistons, who have lost 15 of their last 19 games, are not playing stellar basketball. But the LeBron-free Lakers are beginning to look more cohesive and more confident than they did in the days after they lost him to his injury on Dec. 25. They have won two straight, with James’s return date still uncertain.","After the Lakers’ medical staff evaluated James on Thursday, the team announced in a statement that he was progressing and had been cleared “to increase on-court functional basketball movements.” He is scheduled to be re-evaluated next Wednesday, but in the meantime the Lakers will play on without him, starting Friday against the Utah Jazz.","James’s absence — however long it lasts — may not wind up being the worst thing for the Lakers. His workload over the past decade-plus has been immense, with most of his seasons extending through the N.B.A. finals. He just turned 34. Assuming he returns at full strength, without complications, James could probably benefit from a midseason break.","More important, perhaps, has been the opportunity for the team’s lesser lights to operate on their own. The training wheels are off. For a while, it looked bleak. The Lakers lost five of their first six games without James, and it got bad enough that Kobe Bryant logged on to Twitter to defend Walton from an angry mob.","“Relax,” Bryant, one the franchise’s most iconic figures, wrote in a post on his account. “Entire squad is damn near out.”","At the time, the Lakers were without James, Kuzma and Rajon Rondo. Rondo could miss another two to three weeks after undergoing surgery on his right hand (for the second time this season), but Kuzma, who was sidelined for two games with a back contusion, has since returned.","On Monday, with the rust from his injury still apparent, Kuzma shot 4 of 20 from the field in a win against the Dallas Mavericks. On Tuesday, an off day for the Lakers, he went to the practice facility and took 500 shots, Walton said. On Wednesday, Kuzma scored a career-high 41 points in 29 minutes while shooting 16 of 24 from the field.","“If you would have told me two years ago, when I was in college, that I would score 40 for the Lakers, I probably wouldn’t have believed you,” Kuzma said. “Kind of crazy.”","But this is his reality at age 23, and Walton said he was also pleased with the aggressive play of Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, who are both 21. They are learning as they go, and their curriculum has been more advanced in recent days.","At the same time, the Lakers have emerged as a surprisingly respectable defensive team. Entering Thursday, they ranked eighth in the league in overall defensive rating.","Asked what he knew about his team at this stage of the season, Walton said: “We know that when we’re at our best, we’re a really good team. We know that we’re a team that can hang our hat on playing defense and getting stops. We’re good when we get out and run. LeBron James is really good.”","But really, Walton said, there are probably more unknowns than knowns with this group. On only a handful of occasions has he had close to a full roster at his disposal. The rest of the league will be interested to see what the Lakers look like when he finally does."
The Warriors Prepare to Add Another Star: DeMarcus Cousins - The New York Times,"DENVER — Moments after the Golden State Warriors finished obliterating the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night, Draymond Green was asked about a teammate who did not even play — a teammate, in fact, who has yet to log a single minute this season but is nearing his much-anticipated debut.","“Hopefully,” Green said, “it’s devastating for everybody else.”","Let that soak in for a second. The Warriors, who have won three of the last four N.B.A. championships, are already good at basketball. All they did on Tuesday was set an N.B.A. record by scoring 51 points in the first quarter — the first quarter! — against a team that came into the game with the best record in the Western Conference.","But now, after signing DeMarcus Cousins over the summer and spending recent months incorporating him into their dynastic fold as he recovered from Achilles’ tendon surgery, the Warriors expect him to be in their starting lineup when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. It is a grand experiment that will play out over the second half of the season.","“More than anything, we’re just excited for DeMarcus,” Coach Steve Kerr said late Tuesday night, adding: “It’s going to take him some time to get his rhythm.”","Cousins, a 28-year-old center and a four-time All-Star, has not played since Jan. 26, 2018, when he tore his left Achilles’ in a game for the New Orleans Pelicans. At the time, Cousins was having a career season, with averages of 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists a game. He was also due for free agency and an enormous payday.","But his type of injury has ended careers, particularly among big men, and every team in the league balked at offering him a long-term deal. He wound up with the Warriors, who signed him to a one-year contract worth $5.3 million — a modest price for a reclamation project with upside and little obvious risk.","“It’s a relief,” Cousins told reporters last week. “It’s been a long year for me, a lot of ups and downs, but the finish line is ahead.”","There is no way of knowing if Cousins, who is listed at 6-feet-11 and 270 pounds, will ever be the top-tier player he once was. But the Warriors neither need nor expect him to be a focal point of their offense, and if he merely commands attention from defenders, especially in the post, he should free up additional space on the perimeter for the team’s cavalcade of shooters.","“We haven’t had a player like him before, so it will be new,” Kerr said. “It won’t be a simple ‘plug him in and he’ll fit right in.’ We’ll play through him some, so there will be a period where we have to adapt. Fortunately, we’re halfway through the year. We have a lot of games to figure this out.”","Since the Warriors began collecting championships under Kerr in 2015, they have had a rotating cast of dependable but unspectacular centers: Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli, Zaza Pachulia, JaVale McGee. Cousins has never been a role player, though he acknowledged his new (and unfamiliar) place in the Warriors’ ecosystem.","“Well,” he said, “I won’t be taking as many shots as I have in the past.”","He also has a reputation for being emotional, and something of an antagonist. Some of the Warriors have firsthand experience. Kerr recalled getting ejected after arguing with the officials in a game against the Sacramento Kings in 2017, back when Cousins was playing for them. But before he left the court, Kerr caught Cousins taunting him by waving goodbye.","Then there was an episode last season, when Cousins was playing for the Pelicans, and he got into an altercation with Kevin Durant. After both players were ejected, Cousins tried to track down Durant outside the Warriors’ locker room — and not to exchange pleasantries.","“It shows that you care,” Cousins said of playing with passion. “It shows that it means something to you. I’m not really fans of the guys who are emotionless on the floor.”","Nuggets Coach Mike Malone, who briefly coached Cousins in Sacramento, said he enjoyed the experience.","“I loved coaching him,” Malone said. “I think he’s a player that’s misunderstood, and when you have a chance to know him, you realize who he is as a player and as a person. And when he’s healthy, he’s one of the more unstoppable big men in the N.B.A.”","Malone compared Cousins to Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets’ fourth-year center and an emerging multidimensional force.","“He can score inside, and he can score outside,” Malone said of Cousins. “He can handle the ball, and he can make his teammates better.”","Malone said he expected that Cousins would give the Warriors “a big lift,” and Malone made those remarks before the Nuggets’ 142-111 loss to the Warriors.","The Warriors have had their struggles this season, although these things tend to be relative. Green beefed with Durant. Stephen Curry missed 11 games with a strained groin. Klay Thompson labored through an early-season shooting slump that he refused to acknowledge as an early-season shooting slump. And they have lost more games than they usually do.","The Warriors have been rolling of late, though, winning seven of their last eight before their game against the Pelicans on Wednesday night. They appear to be playing their best basketball of the season, as evidenced by their demolition of the Nuggets, a rout so thorough that Malone said it would be impossible for his team to just “flush” the loss and forget it.","But now, as the Warriors get ready to introduce Cousins to their explosive mix, there are questions: Can he play with pace? Can he acclimate himself to a supporting role? Can he defend quicker players if opponents go small against him? And most important, can he stay healthy and find his old form ahead of the playoffs?",The Warriors are eager to find out.
Adam Silver Calls the N.B.A. ‘a 52-Week-a-Year Sport’ - The New York Times,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — After two weeks of Anthony Davis’s trade request dominating conversation around the N.B.A., Commissioner Adam Silver on Saturday sounded sanguine about any possible negative effects it was having on the league.","“Some of the greatest players in the history of this league have demanded trades at various points of their contracts,” he said at his annual All-Star weekend address. He went on to say that there was “very little” he could do to completely stop players from trying to force trades.","Davis was fined $50,000 for the public trade request made by his agent, Rich Paul. Silver said it was healthy for players and their agents to have ongoing conversations with their teams about future intentions, but that he preferred that such conversations happen behind closed doors. As for the frenzy of news media attention surrounding Davis and his possible destination this summer, Silver said the “public spectacle” wasn’t the type of media interest the league wanted.","“We certainly are becoming a 52-week-a-year sport, and it’s largely the result of tremendous interest in these players,” he said. “I think we could do a better job as a league in avoiding those situations where they get to the point where players are maybe demanding they be traded or, worst-case scenario, saying, ‘I’m not going to honor my contract.’”",[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo’s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame],"Silver has frequently stated a desire to improve the N.B.A.’s competitive balance. Asked whether small-market teams could compete with large-market franchises, Silver largely disputed the premise without even citing the fact that the Milwaukee Bucks, a small-market club, currently have the best winning percentage in the league.",He took the opposite approach.,"“I’m not even sure where the line is anymore on big markets,” he said, pointing out that the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls — teams that play in major cities — have struggled on the court in recent years.","Silver also said it was too early to judge whether reforms to the draft lottery, intended to reduce the incentive to tank in pursuit of a high draft pick, were having the intended effect. Four teams this year are on pace to win fewer than 20 games, but Silver said there is also an unusually large number still in contention for a playoff berth.","“I personally don’t think it is a winning strategy over the long term, losing for multiple years,” said Silver. He also said that choosing to be uncompetitive for an extended period of time would most likely have a “corrosive’’ effect on any team that took that approach.","Taken together, Silver’s responses to questions suggested that he was relatively happy with the state of the N.B.A. and believed that the league’s problems could be solved through tweaks to the system, not wholesale changes.","Silver opened the news conference by addressing House Bill 2, the law passed in North Carolina in 2016 that invalidated local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the genders listed on their birth certificates. In response to the law, the N.B.A. took the All-Star Game, originally scheduled to be played in Charlotte in 2017, away from the city.","He said it was the view of the league office that the law discriminated against the LGBTQ community, and subsequently the N.B.A. made the decision that it was “inconsistent with the values of this league to play the All-Star Game here under those circumstances.” The N.B.A. decided to return after the law was partially repealed.","Asked about efforts to improve the culture of the Dallas Mavericks, where a league investigation found numerous instances of sexual harassment and improper conduct among employees, Silver offered few specifics but said there was a “complete sea change in culture on the business side” of the organization.","Earlier Saturday, the N.B.A., in partnership with the International Basketball Federation, announced the formation of the Basketball Africa League, a 12-team professional league made up of clubs from across Africa. The league will begin play in 2020, the first time that the N.B.A. will be involved in the operation of a league outside of North America.","Many details, including which clubs from which countries will be part of the league, have yet to be finalized, but Silver did say that former President Barack Obama would be involved in the league in an unspecified capacity."
Andrew Bogut’s Rule for an N.B.A. Return: ‘Golden State or Nothing’ - The New York Times,[Want to read more from Marc Stein? Sign up for his free weekly newsletter here.],"Andrew Bogut made his return to the N.B.A. on Wednesday, signing a rest-of-the-season contract to rejoin the Golden State Warriors. The reunion came two years to the day since Bogut, the former No. 1 overall selection in the 2005 draft, sustained a gruesome leg injury.","Bogut, 34, spent this season starring for the Sydney Kings in his native Australia and, by his own admission, was convinced “that the N.B.A. door had shut.”","But the Warriors began lobbying Bogut to rejoin them in December and made it to March with a roster opening for the 7-foot center, who wasn’t available to be signed until the Kings’ season ended last weekend.","“I was kind of blown away,” Bogut said in a telephone interview from Australia. “This wasn’t a situation where I threw my hat in the ring to try to get signed in the N.B.A. I wouldn’t do that.","“To come back to the N.B.A., for me, was basically Golden State or nothing. But the fact it was Golden State — it was the kind of opportunity that I would be kicking myself if I didn’t take.”","When Bogut signed a two-year deal with Sydney last April, he described it as “my official retirement from the N.B.A.” He proceeded to win Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year honors in Australia’s National Basketball League, averaging 11.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.7 blocks per game.","Bogut’s contract with Sydney does not contain an N.B.A. release clause, but he told the Warriors that he would entertain the prospect of rejoining them on a short-term basis after the Australian season — as long as Sydney officials blessed it — should Golden State still have a need.","Had the Warriors succeeded in landing a recent free agent from the so-called “buyout” market — such as the swingman Wesley Matthews, who opted to sign with Indiana after securing his release from the Knicks — they would have had no roster room for Bogut.","But once it became clear that the Chicago Bulls would refuse to release the veteran center Robin Lopez before March 1, thus missing deadline for Lopez to retain his playoff eligibility with a new team, Golden State intensified its pursuit of Bogut as soon as the Kings were eliminated from the N.B.L. playoffs.","As the Warriors continue to try to assimilate the former All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins into their rotation, Bogut said he had “no illusions” about the fact that “some games I’ll play and some games I won’t.” But Bogut insisted he was “happy to be a positive influence on that bench” no matter how much he plays.","The Warriors assistant general manager Larry Harris, who was Milwaukee’s general manager in 2005 when the Bucks selected Bogut with the top pick in the draft, made a recent scouting trip to Australia to assess the state of Bogut’s game firsthand and convey the seriousness of Golden State’s interest.","Warriors Coach Steve Kerr referred to Bogut as “an insurance policy in the frontcourt.” But Bogut’s defensive know-how and his familiarity with the Warriors’ star trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green certainly can’t hurt the league’s prohibitive championship favorites in the quest to improve on their woeful standing of 16th in defensive efficiency (109.5 points allowed per 100 possessions.)","“I didn’t foresee this happening but I’m excited as hell about it,” Green told Bay Area reporters. He and Bogut quickly meshed as co-anchors of a vaunted Golden State defense in 2014-15, when the Warriors began their five-season run of dominance.","After the Warriors won a league-record 73 games in 2015-16 but blew a 3-1 lead to the LeBron James-led Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals, Bogut and the veteran forward Harrison Barnes were quickly jettisoned to Dallas to create the requisite salary-cap space for Golden State to sign Kevin Durant.","Bogut, though, said that returning to the Warriors nearly three years later to play alongside Durant would not “be weird” despite the contentious nature of his departure.","“The Golden State Warriors are a very special organization in my heart,” Bogut said. “I had a lot of great years there and won a championship. Even though they moved me, it was understandable to get a guy like Kevin Durant. I probably would have traded myself if I had the same opportunity.”","It was Bogut’s longtime agent, David Bauman of Independent Sports and Entertainment, who first pointed out to him that Wednesday’s signing with the Warriors coincided with the two-year anniversary of the fractured tibia in his left leg that Bogut sustained 56 seconds into his Cleveland Cavaliers debut in March 2017.","“It’s just funny how the world works sometimes,” Bogut said. “This is an unbelievable opportunity that I’m really thankful for.”"

Someone please remember to send Mother’s Day flowers. Father’s Day will be celebrated pending the length of the finals.","The reporting grind of the 82-game regular season is disruptively hectic enough. But during the postseason, the sport sheds its least watchable teams, as well as a few that are competitively marginal, and gets down to the games that conclusively matter.",Breakout performances will become instant classics. Acknowledged stars could transition into legends with championship rings. Nothing may be missed in the postseason business of media-driven mythmaking.,"Will Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors win a fourth ring in June, bringing him within two of Michael Jordan’s and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s half-dozen each (though still far behind Bill Russell’s 11)? Or will destiny call upon a first-timer like the so-called Greek Freak, Giannis Antetokounmpo of the rising Milwaukee Bucks?","As a sports reporter and columnist for four decades, the last 25 years of which were with The Times, the playoffs habitually meant two months of missing the springtime sun and — by the early 1990s — my two young sons, while chasing the extended N.B.A. family of one-name luminaries. (You know who I mean: Magic, Larry, Michael, LeBron.)","Throughout the playoffs, reporters must confront the crush of late-night deadlines while nattily dressed superstars complicate filing by taking their sweet time getting to the interview podium. Hours later, it’s on to the next city, the next round, often dealing with the logistical conundrum of never being sure when one series will end and the next will begin.","For a portion of my years on the basketball beat, that meant attaching myself to the Knicks, who children of a certain age might have a hard time believing consistently qualified for the playoffs. That was way back in the 1990s, otherwise known around New York as the Patrick Ewing Era.","When Ewing’s Knicks were ousted, it was on to chronicle Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls as they accumulated six titles in eight years, disbanding in 1998 and ceding short-term control of the sport to the Los Angeles Lakers of Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. And so it went, into a new century that spawned even greater global exposure and scrutiny of a virtual one-man industry, LeBron James Inc.","For those having slept through the last six months, James will not be appearing in the 2019 playoffs after a gargantuan run of reaching the league championship series for eight straight years. His migration to Hollywood from Cleveland produced a critically assailed version of Lakers Showtime that, had he not signed a four-year contract last summer, would have already been canceled. (The Lakers’ hope of attracting a worthy co-star is as yet unrealized.)","Hence, the fortunes of the soon-to-be free agents Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and others will be fascinating spring subplots. No reporters worth their credentials will risk blinking through a telltale expression or a body-language betrayal of otherwise guarded intentions.","The playoffs, while typically impassioned and illuminating, are also logistically exhausting, but I confidently speak for my N.B.A. media brethren when I say that covering them is far more privilege than punishment.","The game looks much different now — so much of it focused on 3-point shooting — than it did during my earliest years on the N.B.A. beat. Back then, I routinely insisted there was no place in the world I would rather be than the old, ventilation-challenged Boston Garden for a showdown between the Celtics and Lakers. The modern and far more international N.B.A. media no doubt is equally passionate.","But lives do change. Issues arise. We in the ever-more-distant press-row seats do not attend games with traditional partisan interests, but over the long playoff haul, personal circumstances and needs do create some dilemmas.","Consider my plight in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 1993 finals between Jordan’s Bulls and Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Suns. The Bulls were leading in the series three games to two, but were trailing by 2 points while trying to avoid playing a seventh game in a hostile road arena.","Back home in Brooklyn, my wife was seven months pregnant with our second child while simultaneously preparing to sell our co-op and buy a house in New Jersey. Had the Bulls lost Game 6, I would not have made it home until the night before both closings and the move.","Fortunately for me, if not the Suns, all five Bulls touched the ball on a play that produced a historically clutch 3-point shot by John Paxson. The Bulls’ bid for a third straight title survived, along with my marriage."
N.B.A. By the Numbers: The League That Never Sleeps - The New York Times,"With all of the trade drama surrounding Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis, the N.B.A. intruded on the N.F.L.’s run-up to the Super Bowl as we have not seen since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on football’s so-called Championship Sunday in 2006.","Now that the Super Bowl is over and even more of North America’s sporting consciousness is there to be seized by professional basketball’s tireless headline-makers, here is our best advice: Buckle up.",What follows is a by-the-numbers look at what the N.B.A.’s 73rd season has served up so far — and what the next five months hold.,"Through Sunday’s games, only the Milwaukee Bucks were on a 60-win pace.

Luka Doncic Is a Sore Loser. He Is Also a Sensation. - The New York Times,"DALLAS — Dirk Nowitzki has seen many things in his 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. What he had never seen, until last month, was a fellow Maverick who could attract nearly two dozen autograph seekers in subzero temperatures to greet the team bus on a Thursday morning in Detroit.","Luka Doncic did just that in the 2 a.m. hour of Jan. 31, as the Mavericks pulled into a hotel adjacent to the world headquarters of General Motors, on the unglamorous end of a back-to-back set that began in New York.","It is likewise safe to presume that none of Nowitzki’s other 197 teammates over two decades in Dallas could have inspired what happened mere hours later. In a swift-moving blockbuster trade, Dallas acquired Kristaps Porzingis from the Knicks to serve as Doncic’s sidekick, with Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson openly admitting that he pushed for the deal because Doncic has “fast-forwarded a lot of our decision-making.”","These are the tales from just one day, albeit maybe the wildest day, of what Nowitzki frequently refers to as Lukamania.","“When we get to cities now, even late at night, there are so many people waiting with things for him to sign that it’s almost like we’re the Warriors,” Nowitzki said. “Lukamania is real. We’re living it every day.”",[Another Rookie: The Perimeter Can’t Protect You From Mitchell Robinson],"This week brings another milestone for Doncic, who celebrates his 20th birthday on Thursday. He is averaging 20.9 points, 7.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists through 56 games and is responsible for four of the five triple-doubles in N.B.A. history recorded by teenagers. It is a start that has quickly validated Nelson’s long-held belief that Doncic possessed superstar potential.",The only other rookie in league history to hit those levels over a full season was Oscar Robertson in 1960-61.,"“I love, love, love guys that can pass the ball,” Nelson said, prioritizing Doncic’s ability to run a team at 6 feet 7 inches over the fact he is already known for having the league’s second-most-feared step-back jump shot, behind only James Harden’s.","“I knew I could play over here,” Doncic said, “but it’s better than I expected, for sure.”","The gaudy numbers and worldwide interest in his exploits enabled Doncic to amass more than four million votes in N.B.A. All-Star balloting, trailing only LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Doncic, in other words, finished higher in leaguewide balloting than Michael Jordan (fifth) did as a rookie. Higher, too, than James (13th) and even Yao Ming, who could manage only the fourth-highest total in 2003 despite the considerable voting might of Yao’s native China.","Doncic’s instant production has also validated every pundit who insisted, amid no shortage of skepticism, that concerns about Doncic’s athleticism and corresponding ability to deal with the length of N.B.A. defenders were folly given the rampant success he achieved both at the club (Real Madrid) and national team (Slovenia) levels as an 18-year-old. In the process, Doncic has unleashed a torrent of second-guessing upon the teams (Phoenix, Sacramento and Atlanta) that let him slip to the Mavericks. ","Yet Doncic insists his maiden N.B.A. season, which appears destined to be christened with the league’s rookie of the year trophy, has not been as easy it looks.","The Mavericks, you see, were 26-34 entering Wednesday night’s home date with Indiana and likely to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season. They have traded away all four of Doncic’s projected fellow starters (Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes) in deals that netted Porzingis and roughly $30 million in salary-cap space, neither of which can help the team this season.","It is the first time in Doncic’s life, since he took up basketball at age 7, that he has experienced losing. One hint of how well he’s coping with it: Doncic has pulled his jersey apart in frustration after a play gone awry — twice.","“It’s harder than people think,” Doncic said.","“He’s a winner — he won everything in Europe,” Juancho Hernangomez of the Denver Nuggets said. “So every time he loses, he gets so mad.”","Hernangomez has been observing Doncic from close range for years, both on the floor — since Doncic played alongside Hernangomez’s brother, Charlotte’s Willy Hernangomez, at Real Madrid — and through their shared WhatsApp chat room, which houses various European players fond of the popular video game Fortnite. But Mavericks officials are not worried about a scouting report from a friend that paints Doncic as a sore loser.","“He doesn’t handle losing well — I know that for a fact,” Dallas Coach Rick Carlisle said. “But I don’t handle losing well, either.”","As recently as May 15, Mavericks executives were worried about Doncic — big time. Having known for more than a year that they wanted to draft him if they had the chance, team officials were crestfallen in Chicago when Dallas slipped from a projected No. 3 in that night’s draft lottery to No. 5. ","“It was devastating for us,” Nelson said. “We thought our chance to get him was gone because it’s really hard to trade up in the lottery.” ",Nowitzki betrayed a public hint of the organization’s disappointment when he tweeted this reaction: “Of course.”,"To move up high enough, Dallas ultimately had to persuade the Atlanta Hawks to surrender the No. 3 overall pick. It cost Dallas both the No. 5 pick, which Atlanta used to take Trae Young, as well as the Mavericks’ top pick in the 2019 draft. ","But the Dallas owner, Mark Cuban, blessed the deal, even at that price, because Nelson lobbied so hard for it. Five years earlier, during the 2013 draft, Nelson and his longtime international scout, Tony Ronzone, pushed for the Mavericks to use the No. 13 pick on a little-known Greek teenager named Giannis Antetokounmpo. Cuban wouldn’t allow it, given that Antetokounmpo, unlike Doncic, was mostly a mystery — and promptly regretted it as Antetokounmpo blossomed into a star in Milwaukee.","So this time, after the disappointment of the lottery, Cuban blessed Nelson to do whatever it took to land Doncic. What the team got was the son of a former Slovene pro — Sasa Doncic — and a veteran of three full seasons in the EuroLeague and Spain’s La Liga with Real Madrid after Luka Doncic made his pro debut at 16.","To the Mavericks’ delight, Doncic was more N.B.A.-ready than they ever dreamed — as his 16-for-29 shooting in the final three minutes of one-possession games this season would suggest. As Carlisle put it: “Unique background, unique skill set, unique body type.”","“I hesitate to throw out names like LeBron James and Magic Johnson, who have been do-everything kind of stars, but it’s pretty clear now that Luka has many of those same traits and has proven that he can do a lot of those things,” Carlisle said. “He has deceptive size, strength and quickness — and an understanding beyond his years on how to use his body to make plays and draw fouls.”","Carlisle is hardly alone in making such lofty comparisons. Miami’s Dwyane Wade, one of the league’s foremost James experts after their four seasons together with the Heat, has called Doncic’s passing “LeBron-like.” ","Los Angeles Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said of Doncic: “He’s my favorite player to watch almost, and not talking just rookies. First of all, he plays with a great joy — I love that. And he’s just so advanced in the way he plays. The sky’s the limit for him. Wait until he gets in shape.”","Rivers was laughing when he tacked on that last line, but he did hit on a prime area of Year 1 concern with Doncic — conditioning.","The Mavericks and Doncic’s representatives, headed by the longtime N.B.A. agent Bill Duffy, agreed shortly after the draft to impose as much rest on Doncic as possible from July through September after a nonstop run at the highest levels of international basketball for nearly a year. Doncic thus began the season heavier than his listed weight of 218 and has absorbed jibes about his diet ever since.","But Mavericks officials are pleased with the gradual changes in Doncic’s dietary habits. At the team’s behest, Doncic hired a chef in December to prepare a number of meals for pregame and off-night consumption. Doncic has also begun working fresh juices into his routine.","In Madrid, Doncic lived for the past two and a half years with his mother, Mirjam Poterbin, who raised Doncic while running two beauty salons in Ljubljana. (Doncic has long declined to discuss his father.)","In Dallas, mom and son live separately near the American Airlines Center as Doncic grows into his independence, but still within walking distance.","“This was his dream,” Poterbin said. “At 7 years old he was already talking about N.B.A. I cry a lot of times.”",Yet there have been Year 1 challenges and disappointments for Doncic amid the Lukamania — and beyond the ever-present adjustment to playing for a team with scant postseason prospects.,"He watched helplessly as his fellow Spanish-speaking teammate J.J. Barea suffered a season-ending Achilles’ tear in January. He lived through his first big trade, seeing Dallas abruptly abort its planned Doncic/Smith Jr. partnership when the chance arose to acquire his pal Porzingis.","“I was shocked,” Doncic said. “Europe doesn’t work like this.”","Doncic has also struggled at times with his free throws, converting just 72.6 percent this season despite proving so adept at getting to the line (6.4 times per game). Mom, meanwhile, admitted that Doncic was “quite sad at first” about missing out on an All-Star spot because of a format change in which fan balloting, as of last season, only accounts for 50 percent of the equation for determining starters.",The good news: These all rank as welcome tests — even the Mavericks’ sub-.500 record — compared to the early hurdles posed by the transition Doncic faced at 13. That was his tender age when Doncic left his mother back in Slovenia to enter the Real Madrid academy.,"“There are no words to describe this, really,” Poterbin said. “Honestly I would not go through it again.”","“It was way harder,” Doncic said, “than coming from Madrid to here.”"
"‘Hello, Kevin Knox.’ A Knicks Rookie Breaks Out. - The New York Times","In a rookie season that has resembled a seismograph, Knicks forward Kevin Knox needed a performance like Sunday’s against the Los Angeles Lakers. He scored 19 points with an array of shots, slashing to the basket, hitting a step-back 3-pointer while guarded by LeBron James and finishing with finesse on a driving, left-handed layup.","“Hello, Kevin Knox. It was good to see him play well,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “He’s had his bumps. We know it’s there, it’s in there. It’s just a matter of the ball going in and him getting his confidence up. But I really thought he came with a mind-set that he was going to get out of this rut. The way he was attacking, the force he was playing with.”","Knox shot 8 of 14 from the field and 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the Knicks’ 124-123 victory over the Lakers, their 14th win in a dismal season.","“I’d been struggling a little bit, but the whole team and coaching staff had confidence in me,” Knox said. “I came to work every single day, got up extra shots. I knew I was going to come out of the streak, so I just wanted to make sure I kept shooting.”","Last year the Knicks selected Knox, a freshman from Kentucky, in the first round of the draft, ninth over all. After an ankle sprain sidelined him at the start of the season, Knox’s play took off in December, when he averaged 17.1 points and was named the Eastern Conference rookie of the month.","Knox, 19, hit the rookie wall beginning in mid-January, with a 20-game stretch in which he shot 31.8 percent from the field and 27.7 from beyond the 3-point arc. The slump started soon after he scored 31 points, his highest total in the N.B.A., during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers.","Shortly before that, Knox had said that he was still learning how to adjust to the demands of the long N.B.A. schedule and its 48-minute games, compared with a 40 minutes in college and A.A.U. ball.","“It’s totally different,” he said in late December. “Eight minutes doesn’t seem like a lot, but it really is. That’s a whole quarter almost. Eight minutes is a long time in basketball.”","To improve his fitness, Knox did extra sprints after practice and spent more time on the treadmill, running spurts of 15 minutes with the last two as fast as he could.","At various points in the season, Fizdale has brought in former Knicks greats like Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier to speak to his young, struggling team. (The coach, who was a Miami Heat assistant coach when James played for them, also made a point of introducing Knox to the Lakers star after Sunday’s game.)","King, who was with the Knicks for five seasons in the mid-1980s, and was known for his seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot, has focused especially on mentoring Knox.","In between their meetings early in the season, Knox studied online video highlights from King’s career.","“He helps my game, every time I talk to him,” Knox said. “He’s kind of like me, a wing that gets to the basket, loves transition. He kind of reminds me of myself.”","Perhaps the other way around, rook.","Knox said he had sought out his own tutors as well, connecting with Chris Bosh, Grant Hill, Jalen Rose, Carmelo Anthony and former Kentucky players for bits of advice during the trying moments.","After Monday night’s 128-92 loss in Toronto, the Knicks had 11 games left in the season, all of them meaningless, except for their effect on the draft. The three teams with the lowest win totals will each have a 14 percent of landing the No. 1 selection in June, which presumably will be the Duke freshman Zion Williamson.","The Knicks, who have the worst record in the league (14-57), are expected to lose their way into one of those slots, even after that uplifting win against the Lakers, which ended when the Knicks’ Mario Hezonja blocked a shot by James in the waning seconds.","“We had a lot of ups and downs this season,” Knox said afterward. “It was big-time win, the first sweep of the season. It’s just a great way to win in the Garden, in the last 10 seconds, against one of the best players to ever play the game and we get a defensive stop with the crowd standing up yelling.”","At a critical stretch in the fourth quarter, the Knicks had its three rookies on the court — Knox, center Mitchell Robinson, guard Allonzo Trier — plus guard Kadeem Allen, who was just called up from the Westchester developmental team, and forward Lance Thomas, the longest-tenured Knick.","“There’s a process that needs to happen, and ours is growth, making sure the young guys are getting the experience they need in order to be good in this league,” Thomas said. “A lot of young guys don’t get to play especially extended minutes in their first year. It’s a learning experience for young guys. Our goal is to fast-track them.”","Knox is sixth in the league among rookies in minutes played per game, at 28, despite shooting a subpar 36.4 percent from the field and struggling with weakside defense. He is averaging 12.3 points with 4.3 rebounds.","Even so, Fizdale has never considered sending Knox to Westchester to work on his game in the anonymity of the G League “because our team was already like a glorified G League team,” Fizdale told reporters last week. Because his rookies played substantial minutes all season, he said, he thought it was better for them to take their knocks against the best.",Such as James on Sunday and Toronto’s Kawhi Leonard on Monday.,"“Welcome to the league, kid,” Fizdale said. “This is what it’s about. This is why I wanted him in this. Take those lumps now. Later on in his career, no one will remember this stuff when he is the guy beating up on kids. This is all good for him.”"
LeBron James ‘Activated’ in Lakers’ Comeback Win Over Rockets - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers described last weekend’s N.B.A. All-Star break as an opportunity for a much-needed reset, with the hope that they could ultimately make a playoff push after spending a few days apart. None of it sounded very convincing.","But when the team reconvened for practice on Wednesday morning, LeBron James said his level of intensity had been “activated,” as if he were a superhero who had flipped a switch. He does not usually activate himself this early in the season, he said, but the Lakers need all of him now — in large part because they had lost so much ground when he was sidelined for about a month with a groin injury.","“We would have loved to have had success when I was out, but we didn’t, so this is where we are right now,” James said.","And when asked how he would elevate the play of his younger teammates, he put it simply: “We don’t have a choice.”","In other words, it was sink or swim for the Lakers before their game against the Houston Rockets on Thursday night, and there would be no lifeguard.","For one night, at least, the Lakers swam. They were cohesive enough to come away with a 111-106 victory against one of the better teams in the Western Conference. For one night, at least, the Lakers showed that they could erase a 19-point deficit by playing solid defense and making their free throws. For one night, at least, the Lakers could depend on players like Brandon Ingram (27 points, 13 rebounds) and Kyle Kuzma (18 points) to deliver in a game that the team really needed to win.","The question now is whether the Lakers, who at 29-29 are the very definition of average, can build off it. Consistency has not been their hallmark.","“It can give us some momentum that we need,” Coach Luke Walton said, “or it can do nothing. It depends how we respond to this.”","Not so long ago, the Lakers had a similarly galvanizing win — or so it seemed.","It was Feb. 7, and before the league’s trade deadline Magic Johnson, the team’s president of basketball operations, had failed in his quest to ship nearly half of the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for the All-Star center Anthony Davis. It was a huge soap opera, and the Lakers responded in surprising fashion: by going out that night and defeating the Boston Celtics — on the road, no less.","The win, though, was fool’s gold. The Lakers got pulverized by the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, then hobbled into the All-Star break with a loss to the Atlanta Hawks — a performance so devoid of energy that it seemed to signal a dysfunctional locker room, and maybe even one that was beyond repair.",The team was below .500.,"Walton encouraged his players to reflect and refocus over the break. For James, that meant returning to Los Angeles in playoff mode — much earlier than he would prefer.","But this is unfamiliar territory for James, a three-time champion who has made 13 straight trips to the playoffs and eight straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals. Now, with an inexperienced batch of teammates on the Lakers, he is merely fighting to lead them into the postseason.","“I’m all about being uncomfortable,” he said this week. “I love being uncomfortable. I fall in love with being uncomfortable, so this is another uncomfortable thing for me, and I love it.”","Then he must have loved what happened against the Rockets (33-25), who built a gaping lead in the third quarter behind James Harden. But the Lakers dominated the fourth quarter by limiting the Rockets to 36.8 percent shooting and forcing six turnovers. James finished with 29 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists.","“He’s had more of a serious focus on his face, about him, the last two days, even in the practice facility,” Walton said, adding: “I think he recognizes where we’re at and the sense of urgency we need to play with.”","The Lakers also benefited from the fresh presence of Reggie Bullock, a versatile wing whom they acquired from the Detroit Pistons at the trade deadline. Bullock scored 14 points and defended the Rockets’ James Harden for long stretches. For a team that lacks much experience, Bullock could make a difference moving forward.","“He’s a vet,” James said. “It’s great to have a shooter of his caliber, of his size; his competitive nature out on the floor. He was big for us.”",The Lakers left Staples Center two and a half games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final playoff spot in the West. But James expressed supreme confidence as the team prepared to visit the Pelicans on Saturday.,"“I like where I’m at,” he said. “I will love where I’m at in the next few games, and I believe — continue to get better and better.”","As for his teammates — well, that is up to them."
Take the Lakers. Add Rondo and LeBron James. What Could Go Wrong? - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES — Rajon Rondo has had a difficult time for the Lakers. He was suspended after brawling with the Houston Rockets in the second game of the season. He proceeded to mangle his right hand not just once, but twice, requiring surgery both times while missing a total of 31 games. And in recent weeks, he has been coming off the bench for Coach Luke Walton, even as Lonzo Ball, who had been starting at point guard, continues to recover from an ankle injury.","Rondo, a 13-year pro, was supposed to be an invaluable presence for the Lakers, who had otherwise surrounded LeBron James in Year 1 of the West Coast LeBron era with a cast of unproven (if promising) players and a hodgepodge of reclamation projects. Nobody thought this team would vie for a championship, but the road has been rougher than expected.","In the wake of a recent two-game road trip to New Orleans and Memphis that resulted in two deflating losses and the very real sense that the Lakers could miss the playoffs, Walton approached Rondo for a quiet conversation. Walton wanted to put him back in the starting lineup for Wednesday’s game against the Pelicans, and Rondo was on board with the plan.","After all, what did the Lakers have to lose? Aside from losing another game that they desperately needed to win.","“We sat there and talked,” Walton said. “He’s been fine with his role. He wants to play more — everyone wants to play more. But he hasn’t been complaining or anything like that. But our conversation was one of: ‘Let’s talk about what we need to do. How do we get back on track?’ It was an honest conversation. It was healthy and positive.”","As far as confidence-building exercises go, the Lakers’ subsequent 125-119 victory over the Pelicans was not necessarily Grade A material. The Pelicans have their own issues, and their star center Anthony Davis, who had hoped to be playing for the Lakers after this month’s trade deadline, was on a strict minutes limit as the Pelicans eye a summer sweepstakes for his services. (They would like to keep his limbs intact in the meantime.)","But Walton’s favorite verb after the game was “need,” as in the Lakers needed the win and needed some positive vibes.","Sure enough, Rondo helped a great deal, finishing with 16 assists, 11 points and 7 rebounds in 37 minutes.","“I’m very confident in what Rondo has done in this league,” Walton said. “He’s struggled a little bit, but some of that’s on me. His minutes have been down. We’ve been trying to find different groups to work. But he’s proven over his career that when he gets an opportunity, he shows up to play.”","Rondo was not particularly adept from the perimeter, shooting 5 of 15 from the field, and Davis feasted on the Lakers’ smaller lineup when he was on the court. Walton knows those could be more pressing issues against better teams. But for one night, the Lakers (30-31) allowed themselves to savor some hard-earned momentum — because it might not last.","The Lakers, who have been hindered this season by injuries and trade-deadline intrigue, are not a great basketball team. The question is whether they are merely mediocre, with a chance of still making the playoffs, or not very good at all, in which case they will have wasted their first year with James on the roster.","It hardly helps that the Lakers have one of the league’s most difficult schedules the rest of the way, starting Friday when they host the Milwaukee Bucks, who improved to 47-14 on Wednesday with a win against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers’ coming schedule also includes meetings with playoff-bound teams like the Denver Nuggets and the Toronto Raptors.","“Every day is going to be its own challenge,” James said, adding: “Just try to stay positive throughout whatever’s going on.”","Rondo had experienced his own set of challenges ahead of Wednesday’s game. He was coming off a pair of dreadful performances during the team’s recent two-game trip, averaging 4.5 points and 2 assists off the bench while shooting 36.4 percent from the field. He was a nonfactor, or perhaps even a net negative.","“I didn’t have the rhythm on both ends of the floor,” Rondo said. “That’s why we have 82 games. You have the opportunity to play again and redeem yourself.”","At Wednesday’s shootaround, center Tyson Chandler kept yelling, “energy, energy, energy,” Rondo said. And during the game itself, the players focused on their body language — lots of hugs and high-fives — in addition to actually playing some defense for a change. Walton was also pleased that the Lakers had 37 assists to go with just eight turnovers.","“It’s a lot of fun when your guys are playing like that,” he said.","Forget that the Pelicans are struggling. Forget that James needed to sink a fadeaway 3-pointer from the corner with 31.3 seconds left to seal the win and sidestep disaster. Forget that Julius Randle, a center the Lakers let walk in free agency last summer, torched his old team for 35 points in the loss.","Forget all this until Friday, when Rondo and the rest of the Lakers are sure to face an even stiffer challenge."
LeBron James Is Expected to Miss at Least Another Week - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES — LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has shown throughout his 16-year N.B.A. career that he is good at a lot of basketball-related activities, including scoring, passing, rebounding and winning. But perhaps one of his most remarkable assets — a feat, really — is his durability. He seldom misses games because of injury.","But now, less than a week after turning 34, James is still on the mend from straining his left groin in a win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. The timetable for his return remains uncertain.","The Lakers announced on Friday, before playing the visiting Knicks, that James would not make a coming trip with the team for back-to-back games against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday and the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. The Lakers’ next game after that is on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center.",The team said in its statement that James was making “progress with his recovery” as he received daily treatment from the team’s medical staff and that he would be re-evaluated in one week.,"Entering Friday, the Lakers had lost three of the four games they had played without James, dropping them to eighth place in the Western Conference standings with a 21-17 record — a precarious position for a team with playoff hopes. The Sacramento Kings were two games back in ninth place.","James’s absence has been compounded by the loss of Rajon Rondo, a veteran point guard who injured a ligament in his right ring finger against the Warriors and could miss three to four more weeks after undergoing surgery. Rondo had already missed 17 games this season because of a fractured bone in the same hand.","Their absences have meant an increased reliance on the team’s young core, which includes Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. Those players have delivered at times, but not consistently enough to manufacture many wins.","As for James, he had been playing some of the finest basketball of his career, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists while shooting 51.8 percent from the field and 35.6 percent from 3-point range. He appeared in each of the Lakers’ first 34 games and had not missed a game since April 12, 2017, back when he was employed by the Cleveland Cavaliers. That gave him a streak of 156 consecutive games played, including in the postseason.","“I take a lot of pride in it,” James said of his sturdiness after injuring his groin. “That’s why it pissed me off not to be able to go back into the game. It’s more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That’s something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it’s not a long thing.”","The Lakers initially listed James as day-to-day after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam. But Coach Luke Walton has said that the team will be cautious with James, who signed a four-year, $154 million deal in July.","For much of his career, James has been able to ward off the corrosive effects of his profession — the daily wear and tear, the punishment from defenders. If nothing else, the last couple of weeks have revealed him to be at least semi-mortal, after all — and the Lakers are taking no chances, hoping they can remain afloat until he returns."
DeMarcus Cousins Eyes Return as Warriors Prepare for 5-All-Star Lineup - The New York Times,"DeMarcus Cousins is scheduled to make his long-anticipated debut with the Golden State Warriors during the team’s Los Angeles road trip later this month, according to two people with knowledge of the team’s plans.","The Warriors will play the Clippers on Jan. 18 and the Lakers on Jan. 21, with Cousins expected to make his return from a torn Achilles’ tendon he sustained in January 2018 in one of those two games, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.","After Golden State’s 122-95 rout of the Knicks on Tuesday night, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr would not make any promises but acknowledged that activating Cousins for either Jan. 18 or Jan. 21 is “definitely the range.”","“It’s not as simple as, ‘That’s the game’ — it’s somewhere in that neighborhood,” Kerr said. “Now that we are getting closer, like I told you guys yesterday, he’s made some big strides the last week or two, conditioning-wise.”","Cousins was in the midst of his best professional season with the New Orleans Pelicans last Jan. 26, when he tore his left Achilles late in a victory over the Houston Rockets.","The injury cost Cousins his first career trip to the playoffs after six and a half fruitless seasons with the Sacramento Kings and also led to him signing a one-year, $5.3 million contract with the Warriors in July. The All-Star center found his options limited in free agency amid concerns about how he would recover from such a severe setback.","The Warriors have been eager to see Cousins on the floor to finally address what has been one of the league’s most frequently asked questions since they signed him: How will Cousins find a niche in Golden State’s offense alongside four fellow All-Stars in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green?","“He’s a great basketball player in terms of just feel and things like that,” Curry told reporters Tuesday night. “There’s going to be some fun moments out there.",“I think with the collective IQ we have in our locker room and just understanding the unselfishness around what we do that we’ll be able to figure it out hopefully quickly. But it’s going to be an adjustment for sure.”,"Despite a well-chronicled lack of size on its roster, Golden State has been cautious in bringing Cousins back from what has historically been one of the most unforgiving injuries for basketball players. The Warriors have never had the luxury of fielding an offensive-minded center during their run of three championships over the past four years, but the position has been even more problematic this season after the third-year big man Damian Jones, having been moved into an expanded role, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. Jordan Bell, meanwhile, has struggled to establish a spot in Kerr’s rotation.","“It’s exciting,” Thompson said of Cousins’s coming debut. “I know our fan base is excited, the N.B.A. is excited. I can’t wait to integrate him into our team. He adds a whole new dimension, especially on the block. He’s such a handful down there and with his ability to playmake.”","When Cousins does finally make it onto the court, Golden State will become the first team since the Boston Celtics in 1975-76 to be able to put five All-Stars from the previous season on the court. The Celtics did it that season with a lineup of Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek."
The Perimeter Can’t Protect You From Mitchell Robinson - The New York Times,"Back in November, Mitchell Robinson showed the world what he’s capable of.","Robinson, the rookie Knicks center, absorbed contact under the basket from Orlando’s Melvin Frazier and flopped to the court, hoping for a foul that was never called. Instead, the Magic passed the ball around a few times, finding a wide-open Jerian Grant in the corner, 22 feet from a supine Robinson.","In three seconds that defied reasonable expectation, Robinson got to his feet, raced toward the corner and leapt into the air. He fully extended his lanky 7-foot-1 frame and swatted the 3-point attempt out of midair so matter-of-factly that Grant pulled his hands toward his body, looking almost sorry that he had attempted the shot.","The block was Robinson’s eighth of the game, setting a Knicks rookie record (which he stretched to nine blocks by the end of the night). But beyond the block’s impact in the moment, the play illustrated the 20-year-old’s approach to this season. The perception may be that the Knicks are tanking in hopes of drafting Duke’s Zion Williamson, but for Robinson, any shot an opponent takes is a chance for him to get a block — and he is not going to be cheated out of any of them, even if the shooter is beyond the 3-point line. As a result, a mostly irrelevant team has become must-watch television.","The Knicks had not forgotten that November block when the Magic came back to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. The team posted a video of the play on Twitter, wondering if history would repeat. The post proved prophetic, as Robinson led the way in a 108-103 victory for the Knicks with 17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 blocks and 3 steals in 33 minutes off the bench. Four of the blocks came in just 40 seconds in the second quarter.","“The kid is making history right now,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said of Robinson after the win. “He’s putting himself in groups with historic names. Every single day he continues to grow and get better.”","The Knicks’ two-game winning streak ended on Thursday with a disappointing 125-118 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. But even in defeat, Robinson managed to add to his highlight reel, this time with a shot an opponent didn’t take. ","It was early in the second quarter, and Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova got the ball with a clean look at the basket from 3-point range. As he prepared to shoot, he noticed Robinson a few feet in front of him, with the rookie lowering his shoulder slightly as he prepared to leap. Dellavedova immediately thought better of trying his luck and passed the ball instead. A few seconds later on the same possession, Robinson got his block anyway, swatting away a layup attempt from Marquese Chriss.","A rare prep-to-pro N.B.A. player as a result of his complicated withdrawal from Western Kentucky University, Robinson has been limited to 18.6 minutes a game as he works to refine his game, but he is still third in the N.B.A. at 2.3 blocks a game. When rated by block percentage, which estimates the percentage of an opponents’ shots a player blocks in his time on the floor, Robinson is nothing short of stunning, at 10.4 percent.","Basketball Reference has tracked block percentage back to the 1973-74 season, and the top-four seasons among players with 100 or more blocks belong to Manute Bol, the 7-foot-7 shot-blocking savant. No. 5 on the list belongs to Robinson. ","Sample size obviously needs to be considered, but Robinson stands a chance of being the only qualified player beyond Bol and Alonzo Mourning to finish a season with a block percentage higher than 10. Rim protection luminaries such as Serge Ibaka (9.8), Mark Eaton (9.2) and Dikembe Mutombo (8.8) all fell short of that mark in their best seasons. ","Robinson, who has quickly become a fan favorite, believes he is just getting started. He was asked recently how many shots he could block a game if the team let him play 30 minutes a night. “Probably around six,” he said. “I feel like I can get like six.”","The N.B.A. season record for blocks per game is 5.6, set by Eaton in 1984-85, yet Robinson’s boast does not seem all that far-fetched, largely because of his unusual ability to block shots along the perimeter as well as under the basket.","“His potential is crazy,” Emmanuel Mudiay, the Knicks guard, told reporters before Thursday’s game. “He’s probably the best shot-blocker I ever played with in my life. In my opinion, he’s the best shot-blocker in the league.”","Fizdale has said that Robinson’s confidence and execution have improved since the team acquired DeAndre Jordan to serve as his mentor. The numbers back that up, as Robinson has averaged 11 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.2 blocks a game since Jordan’s arrival on Jan. 31, while still averaging only 23.1 minutes a night. He has also continued to pester outside shooters, with eight of his 35 blocks in February coming on 3-point attempts. ","Fizdale was asked recently if Robinson compared to any other players he had coached. The coach, who has worked with excellent rim protectors like Marc Gasol, Jermaine O’Neal and Chris Andersen, spoke about his rookie like a proud father.","“No,” he said. “He’s a different guy, and he’s got so much more room to grow. I’m going to keep my foot way up his butt to make sure he does.”",That could be terrible news for anyone looking to get a shot off against the Knicks in the coming years. They might find there is no place to hide.
N.C.A.A. Tournament: Duke and the A.C.C. Rule the Bracket - The New York Times,"Duke was given the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament Sunday night, starting Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his star freshman Zion Williamson on a path to what they hope will be the Blue Devils’ sixth national title.","Duke (29-5) was one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams to receive top seeds, joining Virginia (29-3) and North Carolina (27-6). It was the second time members of the same conference were named three of the four No. 1s; the Big East did so in 2009.","The fourth No. 1 seed was Gonzaga (30-3), the small stalwart from Spokane, Wash. While the Bulldogs lost the West Coast Conference title game to St. Mary’s last week, they already have a win over Duke on their résumé from a tournament in late November in Hawaii.",[Region previews: East | West | South | Midwest],"Of course, a top seed is no ticket to the Final Four in Minneapolis. Or even to the second round. Last year, for the first time in 136 such games, a No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 when the University of Maryland-Baltimore County stunned Virginia.","The No. 2 seeds are Michigan State (28-6), Tennessee (29-5), Kentucky (27-6) and Michigan (28-6). The first of these edged the last of these in the Big Ten conference final minutes before the bracket was released. Yet it was the defeated Wolverines who received the privilege of placement in the West alongside Gonzaga, while the Spartans — who won all three games against their in-state rival this season — landed in Duke’s dreaded quadrant.","The Blue Devils finished the regular season on a 3-3 skid without Williamson, who sprained his knee when his shoe ripped open during a game on Feb. 20. But Williamson, the prospective No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft, returned last week, and Duke proceeded to stomp through the A.C.C. tournament. Williamson set the Duke scoring record for that event, with 81 points.","The selection committee effectively ignored the non-Williamson .500 squad and instead considered the team that has won every game except for a 2-point loss to Gonzaga and an overtime loss to Syracuse (20-13). It is Duke’s first No. 1 seed since 2015, which is also the last year it won the tournament.","“They earned their right to be there,” said the selection committee chairman, Bernard Muir, who is Stanford’s athletic director, when he appeared on CBS’s selection show to discuss the bracket.","The most challenging of the four regions appeared to be the South, topped by Virginia. If the Cavaliers get past 16-seeded Gardner-Webb (23-11) on Friday — a game they surely will not take for granted after last year — they could face a No. 8-seeded Mississippi (20-12) that has four wins over tournament teams. Then potential round of 16 opponents include Wisconsin (23-10), underseeded at No. 5, or fourth-seeded Kansas State (25-8), which came close to the Final Four last year.","The South final could well feature No. 2-seeded Tennessee (29-5) or No. 3-seeded Purdue (23-9). Both teams are ranked in the top 10 of KenPom.com’s efficiency ratings, a list Virginia sits atop. And either might have home-court advantage at Louisville’s KFC Yum Center.","The region also features two prominent conference champions: sixth-seeded Villanova (25-9), the current Big East and defending national champion, and seventh-seeded Cincinnati (28-6), which won the American Athletic Conference tournament on Sunday.","In addition to Michigan State, the land mines in the East between Duke and the Final Four could include fourth-seeded Virginia Tech (24-8), which defeated the Williamson-less Blue Devils last month, and third-seeded Louisiana State (26-6), a talented squad that is without Coach Will Wade. He was suspended after a report emerged that he had discussed making an offer to a recruit on a phone call with an aspiring agent convicted of fraud in college recruiting.","The East has other ties to scandal. Seventh-seeded Louisville (20-13) faces 10th-seeded Minnesota (21-13) in the first round, a game that might have been a father-son matchup between Rick and Richard Pitino had the former not been let go as Louisville’s coach in 2017 shortly after corruption allegations became public. And L.S.U.’s first game is against No. 14 Yale (21-7), the Ivy League co-champion, whose women’s soccer program was caught up in the admissions scandal that federal prosecutors revealed last week.","In the national semifinals, the East winner, which will be determined in Washington, will face the West winner. In addition to Gonzaga and Michigan, contenders in that region include third-seeded Texas Tech (26-6), which was considered the best team in the strong Big 12 but was upset in the conference tournament by West Virginia (14-20); and fourth-seeded Florida State (27-7), which looked every bit Duke’s equal in the first half of the A.C.C. title game on Saturday. The West also features two mid-major darlings: No. 6 Buffalo (31-3) and No. 7 Nevada (29-4). The West Regional is in Anaheim, Calif.","North Carolina and Kentucky are fish out of water in the Midwest region, particularly given its setting. In the region semifinals, the Tar Heels could meet fourth-seeded Kansas (25-9), making its record-setting 30th straight N.C.A.A. tournament appearance, while the Wildcats might face sixth-seeded Iowa State (23-11). Those games will take place at Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo. — a second home for the Jayhawks and Iowa State, who have combined to win the last seven Big 12 tournaments there.","The Midwest also features fifth-seeded Auburn (25-9), the surprise Southeastern Conference winner Sunday. Tigers Coach Bruce Pearl, hired in 2014, was effectively barred from N.C.A.A. coaching for three years for recruiting violations at Tennessee. Chuck Person, a former Auburn assistant, was charged with bribery and fraud in the recruiting cases, and last Friday, prosecutors said in a court filing that Person was expected to plead guilty on Tuesday.","The Big Ten led all conferences with eight teams in the tournament, while the Pacific-12 had only three. That number was actually larger than expected a week ago: Arizona State was given one of the last four at-large bids, and Oregon (23-13) surprised Washington (26-8) in the tournament final Saturday night to elbow its way into the field.","The Ducks were one of several unlikely receivers of automatic spots who effectively constricted the pool of 36 at-large bids. In another example, St. Louis (23-12) won the Atlantic 10 tournament Sunday, granting the Billikens a slot alongside Virginia Commonwealth (25-7), which effectively took an at-large bid away from a bubble team by failing to win its conference tournament.","This was the first year in decades that the N.C.A.A. did not use the much-maligned Rating Percentage Index, instead favoring the new N.C.A.A. Evaluation Tool. But the tournament field included 11th-seeded Arizona State (22-10) in its “last four in” despite the Sun Devils’ poor NET, while North Carolina State (22-11), a good-NET, bad-R.P.I. squad, was not even among the “first four out.”",But aficionados will be pleased that Belmont (26-5) of the Ohio Valley earned an at-large bid; the Bruins will play Temple in the play-in game on Tuesday.,"“They made the most of the opportunities they had,” Muir said. “We just thought they were a phenomenal basketball team, very high on the offensive front — great offensive efficiency.”",St. John’s (21-12) was the last team in; the Red Storm will face Arizona State in an opening game on Wednesday.
‘They’re Going to Boo Me.’ Jimmy Butler Prepares for His Return to Minnesota. - The New York Times,"Jimmy Butler knows what’s coming on Saturday night in Minneapolis. He understands, relishes and even encourages the looming prospect of the chilliest welcome any visiting N.B.A. player is bound to receive this season.","“They’re going to boo me,” Butler said of the Minnesota fans who watched him force his way out of town via a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers in November — months after Butler led the woebegone Timberwolves to their first playoff berth in 14 seasons.","“I would boo me, too. I’m not going to lie to you.”","Now a key member of what is widely regarded as the most potent starting lineup on the N.B.A. map outside of Golden State, Butler will be back at Target Center for the first time since the trade turmoil that captivated the league for the first two months of the season.","Butler insisted he was unfazed by what awaited him, and went on to suggest that a number of his Philadelphia colleagues, as well as some longtime friends who plan to be in attendance, will partake in the inevitable hostilities.","“I might actually join in on the boos,” Butler said.",Those who have spent any time around the rugged swingman surely don’t doubt it. At a time when N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver openly frets about player happiness — and when standouts such as Boston’s Kyrie Irving and Golden State’s Kevin Durant routinely rail against the approach of some of the news media — Butler is the rare star who savors the game’s edgy side and has embraced his portrayal as a villain.,"“I love it,” Butler said in a phone interview, repeating the phrase three times — including once with a profanity for emphasis. “Who wants to be loved all the time?","“It’s O.K. It’s fine. I don’t need everybody to like me. I know who I am. I can’t say that enough. I know what I’m about. I know where my heart is. People will say, ‘He’s this way, or he’s that way,’ but nobody knows except for the people around me every day. Ask them and they’ll tell you differently.”","Elton Brand, the 76ers’ general manager, certainly falls within that category, describing Butler as “a caring person” who has quickly endeared himself “not only to his teammates but to our whole business operations staff and in the community.”","As a first-year general manager, Brand had his own reservations before going through with the first major move of his tenure, having watched chaos engulf the Timberwolves from afar — with no shortage of the noise coming from Butler himself after news leaked of the mid-September trade request he made in private.","But when Brand did his research, consulting former coaches and executives who had worked with Butler, along with former players he knew well who had firsthand knowledge, such as Nazr Mohammed and Mike Dunleavy Jr., he received little in the way of dissenting feedback.","“Even with the story that was reported, that wasn’t a big deal,” Brand said, referring to an ESPN report in January that asserted Butler “aggressively challenged” Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown. “He didn’t curse. He wasn’t loud. It was his reputation following him.”","Butler, 29, admitted in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports’s Chris Haynes that he is a “confrontational” teammate, but that he is also trying to be more selective in showing his blunt nature as he gets older. It should be noted that, as Brand found, Butler has also been a largely popular teammate in his stints with the Chicago Bulls and Team U.S.A. — and, frankly, with numerous Timberwolves apart from the All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.","Butler took a hit in some precincts after informing the since-fired coach with whom he’s so closely associated — Tom Thibodeau — that he was no longer interested in trying to nurture Towns and Andrew Wiggins and wanted out of Minnesota. One example of the damage: Butler is one of the top 12 players in the Eastern Conference, but East coaches snubbed him as a reserve for the All-Star Game in February.","Yet Butler plays on, insisting he would “do nothing over” in Minnesota and reveling in the knowledge that for the first time in his career, he’s on a team capable of getting to the N.B.A. finals.","“I will tell you that we’ve got a lot of talent,” Butler said.","The Sixers haven’t established the required consistency to earn the label of East favorites, going 11-6 since the All-Star break with middling placement in both offensive (18th) and defensive (12th) efficiency in that span. Butler, though, is doing what he can to make it work, sacrificing in a manner that would seem to invalidate some of the criticism.","Philadelphia followed its trade for Butler on Nov. 12 by acquiring Tobias Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 6, giving Brown two All-Star-caliber players to team with the dynamic duo of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and the shooter extraordinaire J.J. Redick. In the first 20 games since, when those five players share the floor, Butler has scaled back more than anyone, taking fewer shots (46) than the other four — with Embiid by far in the lead (95 shots).","Of course, in fourth quarters, Butler has emerged as the most reliable offensive option of the quintet, shooting 12 for 18 when all five play together, highlighted by last week’s game-winning jumper against Boston after the Celtics had won six of the teams’ seven previous meetings. The natural drop in Butler’s per-game averages this season, playing for such a loaded team, tends to overshadow the fact that he still ranks 16th in the league in a category (Real Plus-Minus) strongly associated with team success.","“He’s a special talent at closing and winning games — and not just offensively,” Brand said. “He’s just a winner.”","An indication of Butler’s true standing in the game will come July 1, when he becomes an unrestricted free agent for the first time. Brand has said repeatedly that he hopes to keep Philadelphia’s new core four together, but Butler is expected to attract serious interest from both Los Angeles teams as well as the Nets. The Clippers’ special adviser Jerry West, to name one prominent fan, is said to be a longtime admirer of Butler’s two-way impact.",Not that Butler is prepared to discuss much about the future. He brushed off free-agency talk in our conversation and claimed that he didn’t even know Minnesota was on this week’s calendar until I told him.,"He stuck mostly to peripheral subjects. Those include Butler’s devotion to playing dominoes and Uno, his friendship with “the best soccer player in the world” — Paris St.-Germain’s Brazilian star Neymar — and the trusty American football he travels around with. Butler said he plans to toss the football with other 76ers with greater regularity during the playoffs.","“I’m telling you — it takes away some of that pressure,” Butler said.","Thibodeau still lives in Minneapolis in the wake of his Jan. 6 firing, but politely declined to comment about Butler’s visit. Butler, for his part, continues to refer to Thibodeau as “my guy.” He said they maintained regular contact.","Although Butler remains unwilling to dig deeply into the reasons he pushed so hard for an exit so soon after the dramatic impact he had in his lone full season with the Wolves, give him this: He is prepared to take whatever pent-up frustration has been stored up for him in the Twin Cities.","Rather than ask for forgiveness from the locals, or even civility, Butler said: “I did what I did. I’m cool with it. I’m in a good place.”",He has only one request for the basketball public: Pick someone else to win the East besides the up-and-down Sixers.,"“Don’t pick us,” Butler said. “I hope people say we’re going to lose in the first round. I don’t want anybody to think we’re that good because I think it makes us play a little bit harder.”"
"Jim Boeheim Struck and Killed a Man With His Car, the Police Say - The New York Times","Jim Boeheim, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Syracuse, struck and killed a pedestrian on Wednesday night, the police said.","A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said.","The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had “struck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.”","A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim’s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said.",The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.,"“I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim said in a statement. “Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.”","“We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,” said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. “Coach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.”","Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years.","Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49."
"N.B.A. Midseason Power Rankings: The Warriors Are Not No. 1, for Now - The New York Times","[Want to read more from Marc Stein? Sign up for his free, weekly N.B.A. newsletter by clicking here.]",Four of the six best records in the N.B.A. belonged to Eastern Conference teams through Saturday night’s play.,"The Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, reached the 41-game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian (for them) 54-win pace.","The first half of the regular season, in other words, has defied most preseason prognostications and requires special examination to properly sort out the 1-to-30 landscape. So it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known as the Committee (of One) and share my team-by-team progress report in the form of N.B.A. Power Rankings.","The Committee, as it has since the 2002-03 season, determines the order by weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team’s big-picture outlook — with sprinkles of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in.","What used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once-a-season enterprise every January now. Yet the goal, as always, is to provide a more up-to-date and detailed assessment than the standings do.",(Records and statistics are current heading into Sunday’s games.),1. Toronto Raptors (32-12),"The Raptors were this season’s first 30-win team, which is impressive when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have been in uniform together only three times in Toronto’s last 17 games. The threat of the Los Angeles Clippers signing Leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball-loving Canadian, but the Raptors may still assemble the best possible sales pitch: Win the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference to get to the N.B.A. finals and give Leonard ample reason to stay.",2. Milwaukee Bucks (29-12),"Giannis Antetokounmpo supplanting James Harden as the league’s Most Valuable Player? Mike Budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win N.B.A. Coach of the Year? Milwaukee clinching the East’s No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs? Any of those would have been fairly wild claims back in September, but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular-season schedule. The challenge now: Milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two months of its schedule.","3. Golden State Warriors (28-14) Maybe the Warriors do not inspire the fear they once did. Maybe their defensive woes (having slipped to 16th in defensive efficiency) are a sign of true vulnerability. Or maybe, with DeMarcus Cousins just days away from making his long-awaited debut, Golden State’s season is about to start for real. I tend to believe it is the latter, in Year 5 of a historic run, having seen firsthand how much this team can struggle with regular-season motivation.",[Read: DeMarcus Cousins Eyes Return as Warriors Prepare for 5-All-Star Lineup],4. Denver Nuggets (28-13),"The regular season is just under 90 days old. The plucky Nuggets, despite numerous injuries, have held the top spot in the West — Golden State’s conference — for 44 of them. Yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guys get, as N.B.A. know-it-alls wrestle with billing Denver as a full-fledged contender — or dismissing them as a team that can only do pre-April damage. Book this either way: Nikola Jokic is a lock to snag his first All-Star berth.",5. Oklahoma City (26-16),"Remember the Thunder’s 0-4 start? Neither do we. Despite the season-long absence of the ace defender Andre Roberson, Oklahoma City leads the league in defensive rating (allowing just 102.9 points per 100 possessions) and specializes in the physical style that has troubled Golden State in the past. The Thunder have undoubtedly benefited from what ranks as the league’s second-easiest schedule to date, but you would struggle to find a star duo meshing better than Russell Westbrook and Paul George.",6. Houston Rockets (24-17),"Earlier this season, I responded to the Rockets’ disappointing start and Chris Paul’s ongoing hamstring issues by stopping just short of proclaiming the window to contention closed for James Harden and Co. Houston is 7-2 since Dec. 24 — with Harden averaging a mere 41.0 points (and 16.7 3-point attempts!) per game in that stretch. Write the Rockets off if you wish, but Harden’s brilliance, augmented by a resurgent Clint Capela and the newcomer Austin Rivers, should give you pause.",7. Indiana Pacers (28-14),"Surprise No. 1: Only six teams in the league, according to Basketball-Reference.com’s projections, will finish the season with at least 50 wins. Surprise No. 2: Indiana is on that list, ahead of higher-profile teams like Philadelphia and Oklahoma City, despite the fact that the All-Star guard Victor Oladipo has missed 11 games with a knee problem. Coach Nate McMillan, continuity and a top-two defense have the unfashionable Pacers overachieving — again.",8. San Antonio Spurs (25-19),"This season’s 11-14 start marked the first time Gregg Popovich has ever sported a sub-.500 record after 25 games and included a four-game stretch in which the Spurs unfathomably suffered three losses in excess of 30 points. The ensuing turnaround, though, has been no less remarkable. San Antonio is 14-5 and ranks No. 1 in offensive efficiency and No. 2 in defensive efficiency in that span, led by the midrange maestros DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge flat-out ignoring the league’s 3-point revolution.",9. Boston Celtics (25-17),"The numbers continue to say that the Celtics are fine. They have a per-game average point differential (+6.4) that ranks second only to Milwaukee’s (+9.1). Boston is also one of just four teams (along with Milwaukee, Toronto and Denver) to rank in the top 10 in both offensive (ninth) and defensive (fourth) efficiency. The problem: Boston just followed up an impressive rout of Indiana with losses in Miami and Orlando that suggested yet again that things are not fine.",10. Philadelphia 76ers (27-16),"For all the creative tension that has bubbled around the Sixers since they acquired Jimmy Butler on Nov. 10, they have the fourth-best overall record in that span (19-10) despite well-chronicled concerns about shooting and depth around Philadelphia’s star trio as well as the occasional squawking. Butler’s fit alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons has been less than seamless, as predicted, but stockpiling as much talent as possible and then trying to solve the puzzle is the N.B.A. way.",11. Utah Jazz (23-21),"The Jazz have risen to a more familiar No. 5 in defensive efficiency and contend that their road-heavy schedule, with 25 of the first 41 games away, has contributed mightily to keeping them out of the West’s top eight for much of the season. But to resemble the team most experts thought it would be, Utah needs Donovan Mitchell’s January resurgence to last, as well as a return to last season’s standards from Joe Ingles.",12. Portland Trail Blazers (26-17),One of my faulty predictions from last year asserted that 2018 would be the year that the Trail Blazers finally broke up the Damian Lillard/C.J. McCollum partnership as a means to build a more balanced roster. Portland has instead clung to the hope that Jusuf Nurkic will keep inching closer to becoming the consistent third wheel it has needed for ages. It is a better team than last season’s version but only marginally — and still vulnerable to athletic opposition.,13. Los Angeles Lakers (23-20),"Winning without LeBron James is hard. Who knew? The Lakers are 3-6 since James suffered a strained groin in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State. As a result, they have slid from a higher-than-expected No. 4 to an uncomfortable No. 8 in the West — thus resurrecting all the preseason questions about L.A.’s ability to make the playoffs with, shall we say, such an eclectic roster. James appears likely, at 34, to miss more than the 11 games Stephen Curry lost to a similar injury in November.",14. Los Angeles Clippers (24-18),"I fear they are at high risk to slip out of the West’s top eight, but the Clippers would certainly slot in right at the top of the play-hard rankings if there were such an industry. The feisty likes of Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley, flanking a better-than-ever Tobias Harris, continue to make the Clippers more bizarrely competitive than anyone imagined heading into a summer in which they appear well positioned to make the loudest free-agent noise in franchise history.",15. Sacramento Kings (22-21),"A Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer-beater to topple the Lakers on Dec. 27 hiked the fast-paced Kings’ record to 19-16 and seemed to announce the blossoming tandem of De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield as certifiable playoff material after a league-high 12 consecutive seasons of missing out. Sacramento then unraveled, enduring a 1-5 funk which included an embarrassing fall-from-ahead loss at Phoenix when the Suns were without Devin Booker. You cannot afford funks in the West.",16. Miami Heat (21-20),"Little emanating from South Beach makes sense, whether it is Miami’s ability to play .500 basketball despite missing out on Butler via trade and having Goran Dragic healthy for just 14 games — or the fact this team is 0-3 against Atlanta. It is unclear how long it will take Miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of Butler’s caliber, but the retiring Dwyane Wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage.",17. Brooklyn Nets (21-23),"The drop-off from the East’s top five to teams trying to secure the last three playoff stops is as steep as pessimists feared. Not that the Nets intend to apologize after the barren half-decade they endured in the wake of their disastrous 2014 trade with Boston.

New Orleans Pelicans (20-23),"It is a misnomer to say Anthony Davis has no help; Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle are all accomplished players. The Pelicans’ problems have been health (most notably injuries for Mirotic and the point guard Elfrid Payton) and difficulties in playing Davis, Mirotic and Randle together even when they are all available. New Orleans, as a result, is facing the biggest possible issue: Scenarios that force them to trade The Brow grow more plausible by the day.",19. Washington Wizards (18-25),"Indiana has crashed the East’s upper crust to give the conference its own Fab Five, but we were not exaggerating the drop-off to the chasing pack.

Magic Johnson Steps Down as Lakers’ Team President - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES — At the end of a disastrous season in which the Los Angeles Lakers failed to make the playoffs, despite having added LeBron James via free agency, Magic Johnson made the stunning announcement on Tuesday that he was stepping down as the team’s president of basketball operations.","Johnson delivered the news at an impromptu news conference before the Lakers’ regular-season finale, against the Portland Trail Blazers, and he said he had not yet informed Jeanie Buss, the team’s controlling owner. In fact, he had told nearly no one before he addressed a mass of hastily assembled reporters.","“I couldn’t face her to tell her,” he said, referring to Buss. He later added that he would find her at Staples Center to address her in person.","Later, the team released a statement, calling Johnson “not only a Lakers icon, but our family.”",[Magic Johnson’s biggest moments running the Lakers.],"“There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” the statement read, using Johnson’s formal name. “We are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise — as a player, an ambassador and an executive.”","The statement continued, “As we begin the process of moving forward, we will work in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future of our organization.”","“Measured” and “methodical” would be an about-face from the way Johnson stepped down. It was a surreal scene as he fielded questions for nearly 45 minutes after he made his announcement, appearing to hold back tears at times, and repeatedly said that he loved Buss like a sister. He then posed for pictures with team employees, former teammates and a local news anchor.","“I want to go back to having fun,” Johnson, 59, said. “I want to go back to being who I was before taking on this job, and we’re halfway there with LeBron coming. I think this summer, with that other star coming in — whoever’s going to come in — I think this team is going to be in position to really contend for a championship with the growth of the other young players.”","Johnson was named to the post in February 2017 and said at the time that it was “a dream come true.” But on Tuesday he said that he wanted to get back to being a mentor and a businessman, and that he had felt limited in his ability to do those things in his current role.","For example, he said he was upset that he could not attend Dwyane Wade’s final game for the Miami Heat on Tuesday night — or congratulate Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Twitter for finishing the regular season averaging another triple-double. (Johnson said the league would have considered it “tampering.”)","Johnson also said that he had received a phone call last week from the tennis star Serena Williams, asking if he would be an adviser to her.","“When Serena called me, wow, that’s who I am,” Johnson said. “I love helping people.”","He added: “I like to be free. And then I got a great life outside of this. What am I doing? I got a beautiful life, so I’m going to go back to that beautiful life, and I’m looking forward to it.”","But there is palace intrigue at play, too — these are the Lakers, after all — and Johnson strongly indicated that he had been leaning toward firing Coach Luke Walton. Buss, though, is known to think highly of Walton, a former Laker who has been the team’s coach for three seasons, and Johnson suggested that he did not want to go through with it.","“I would have to affect someone’s livelihood and their life,” Johnson said, “and I thought about that. That’s not fun for me. That’s not who I am, and then I don’t want to put her in the middle of us, even though she said, ‘Hey, do what you want to do.’ I know she has great love for him.”","The Lakers, who have been downtrodden in recent years, are still one of the most glamorous franchises in the league, and Johnson, who helped the Lakers win five championships as a Hall of Fame point guard, remains one of the organization’s most popular figures.","Johnson was hired to replace Jim Buss, the brother of Jeanie Buss. Johnson, who had previously been a partial owner of the team as well, worked alongside Rob Pelinka, a former agent, who was brought in as the team’s general manager. (Johnson said that he had not told Pelinka of his decision to step down, either.)","While Johnson had some memorable moments at the helm of the Lakers’ operation, the roster that he and Pelinka built around James was widely considered inadequate. After losing to Portland in their finale, the Lakers had a record of 37-45, which assured them of missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. It is the first losing effort by a James-led team since the star forward’s rookie season in 2003-04, when his Cleveland Cavaliers went 35-47.","On Tuesday, Johnson preached patience.","“I’m excited about the direction,” he said before he headed out the door."
"LeBron James Passes Michael Jordan, a Player He’ll Always Be Chasing - The New York Times","There was no Instagram post celebrating the achievement in advance this time. There was relatively little buildup from the news media. It was an event that might have dominated the news cycle in years’ past, but when LeBron James passed Michael Jordan on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list on Wednesday night, it was a triumph that somehow had been reduced to a footnote.","James came into the Los Angeles Lakers’ game against the Denver Nuggets needing 13 points to surpass Jordan for fourth place on the career list. With 5 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter, he managed to force his way to the basket for a layup, giving him 14 points for the game and 32,294 for his career. For good measure, he was fouled on the play. ","After a short stoppage to acknowledge the moment, play resumed as the Lakers, clinging to the last shreds of their playoff hopes, tried their best to overcome a huge early deficit at home against a heavily favored opponent.","The Lakers, led by an unlikely group of bench players, did make a run at Denver, reducing a 17-point deficit at halftime to 2 points with 8:37 left in the fourth quarter. But the Nuggets regained their footing and ran away with a 115-99 victory, spoiling a night in which James contributed 31 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists, looking far more energized on both ends of the court than he had in recent weeks, and finishing the night with his career point total up to 32,311. ","James, who has taken the brunt of the criticism for the Lakers’ failings in a difficult first year in Los Angeles, had acknowledged the pending accomplishment in a tweet shortly before the game, but was measured when discussing it with reporters earlier in the day.","“I take all accomplishments as they come,” he said. “Any time I’m in the breath with any other greats — and obviously M.J. being the guy that I looked up to my whole life, the guy I admired as a kid — I think it’s going to be pretty cool.”","Jordan, who owns the Charlotte Hornets, issued a brief statement on Thursday, saying, “I want to congratulate LeBron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career.” The statement was notable mostly for being far more succinct than the one he issued when Kobe Bryant passed him on the career scoring list in 2014.",One would hardly have guessed from either man’s words that the greatest current basketball player had just surpassed his idol in their sport’s signature statistic. The inability for James to truly celebrate the moment was yet another indignity in a season full of them.,"It was a little more than a year ago when James had seemingly settled into a groove. He scored his 30,000th point — a feat he congratulated himself about on Instagram hours before he actually accomplished it. With that hurdle cleared, and with recent championship runs in Miami and Cleveland under his belt, his march toward challenging Jordan, then Bryant, then Karl Malone and maybe even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.’s career scoring leader, seemed as if it would come without the criticism that had followed him earlier in his career.","A decision — a loaded word when it comes to James — to move to an ill-prepared Lakers team in the off-season has changed the calculus altogether. The team was predicted by most to struggle to make the playoffs in the West thanks to its collection of too-young players and veterans who do not complement James. Nevertheless, many have labeled the year a disappointment by virtue of the team’s struggles despite having James, a player whose presence has seemingly guaranteed a finals appearance for close to a decade.","As a result, James and the people around him have not been able to take much joy in his accomplishments. Just last week he passed Andre Miller to move into 10th place in career assists, thus making him the only player currently in the top 10 in both career points and assists. That feat — it had been temporarily attained by only a handful of other players going back to the days of Bob Cousy — was met with a collective shrug.",It is a reality of James’s life that he acknowledged on Wednesday.,"“I haven’t really appreciated anything I’ve been able to accomplish because I’m so engulfed in what’s next,” he said. “How I can continue to get better; how I can help this franchise get back to where it needs to be.”","An occasional season of missing the playoffs is not unusual for most players — even the great ones — but to capture how truly rare it would be for a James-led team, consider that he has played double-digit playoff games in each of the last 13 years. He has appeared in nine N.B.A. finals — winning three — and as a result his career rankings among playoff performers come off as outrageous, even for someone as accomplished as James. ",Those rankings almost certainly will not improve this year. But among the more interesting aspects of James’s current predicament is the opinion among many Lakers fans that the team’s struggles have resulted in James’s failing to live up to Bryant’s legacy. Those criticisms ignore the fact that the Lakers’ current six-year run of missing the playoffs included three seasons in which Bryant was still with the team. ,"In fact, when Bryant passed Jordan on the career scoring list in 2014 — a feat considered a big enough deal at the time that a road game in Minnesota was stopped for several minutes so the crowd could give him a standing ovation and the Timberwolves’ owner could present him with the game ball — the Lakers were only 8-16 and, partially a result of a season-ending injury to Bryant later in the year, were on their way to a 21-61 record.","But in one of the endless parallels between the careers of Jordan and James, players who will be debated long after both are gone, Jordan, who passed Wilt Chamberlain for No. 3 on the career scoring list in 2003, also found little joy in what should have been a huge accomplishment, largely because his Washington Wizards were a .500 team at the time. ","“The thing about stats is they define you when you’re 10 or 20 years past the game,” Jordan said when asked to sum up his feelings on the accomplishment. “While you’re playing, what matters is wins.”","James, who wears No. 23 because of Jordan, put a wristband on his forearm because of Jordan, learned to shoot fadeaways because of Jordan and pitches sneakers for Nike just like Jordan does, may want to heed that advice from Jordan in terms of coming back on his accomplishments later, even if they have to be put aside for now. ","The Lakers could never win another game and James, a player who still refuses to label himself a scorer, will always have more points than Jordan, the player who served as his inspiration on a path to greatness. ","“I gotta carry it on to the next kid,” James said after the game, finally letting his emotion truly show. “Hopefully I can inspire the next kid like myself.”"
"Enes Kanter to Skip Knicks’ Trip to London, Citing Fear of Turkish Retaliation - The New York Times",LOS ANGELES — Knicks center Enes Kanter said on Friday that he would not travel with the team to play the Washington Wizards in London on Jan. 17 because he feared retaliation for his public opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.,"Kanter, who is Turkish, has been an outspoken critic of the president for years.","“Sadly, I’m not going because of that freaking lunatic, the Turkish president,” Kanter said after the Knicks’ 119-112 victory over the Lakers. “It’s pretty sad that all the stuff affects my career and basketball because I want to be out there and help my team win. But just because of the one lunatic guy, one maniac, one dictator, I can’t even go out there and do my job. It’s pretty sad.”",Kanter said Turkish operatives could present a danger to him in London.,"“They have a lot of spies there,” he said. “I could get killed there easy.”","An official at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, speaking Saturday on the condition of anonymity to abide by diplomatic protocol, dismissed Kanter’s comments as baseless.",A Knicks official later said that Kanter would not be traveling to London because of a visa issue.,"In May 2017, Kanter was detained for several hours at an airport in Romania after the Turkish government canceled his travel documents. Later that year, Turkey’s state-run news agency reported that prosecutors were seeking more than four years in jail for Kanter on charges that he had insulted Erdogan on social media."
"James Harden, the N.B.A.’s One-Man Band, Hits a High Note - The New York Times",No Chris Paul. No Eric Gordon. No Clint Capela. No problem. The Houston Rockets still have James Harden.,"In a mind-boggling performance, Harden and his supporting cast — if you can call it that — managed to beat the Memphis Grizzlies by 112-94 at Houston’s Toyota Center, with Harden scoring 57 points in 34 minutes.",It was the 17th game in a row in which Harden scored at least 30 points — a feat previously accomplished in a single season by only Wilt Chamberlain — and it was Harden’s third game of 50 or more points this season. No other player has more than one.,"Coach Mike D’Antoni may have recorded the 600th win of his N.B.A. career in the game, but he was more interested in making sure people recognized the greatness of Harden’s feat.","“What he just did, we kind of take it for granted a little bit,” D’Antoni told reporters. “It’s like, ‘Oh, look at that, isn’t that cute?’ It’s 57!” ","Harden, however, tried to keep the focus on Houston continuing to climb in the standings, and making up for Sunday’s loss to Orlando.","“I don’t know if it was an emotional lift,” Harden told reporters of Monday’s win, “but I know it’s crunchtime in the sense that we’ve got three starters out and guys have got to pick up the slack. There’s no excuse.”","While the outburst was hardly unexpected for Harden, who is now averaging an N.B.A.-leading 34.8 points a game, the Rockets’ personnel situation made it stand out. Paul has been out with an injured hamstring since Dec. 20 and Gordon has been out with an injured knee since Dec. 29. Houston’s injury report then took on what seemed like a crippling blow earlier on Monday when it was revealed that Capela, the team’s center — and the most frequent recipient of Harden’s assists — would be out for four to six weeks as a result of ligament damage in his right thumb.","That list of injuries left Harden starting alongside the forgettable quartet of P.J. Tucker, Nene, Austin Rivers and Danuel House Jr. No matter, as Harden joined Kemba Walker as the only players to score more than half of their team’s points in a game this season.","Harden was hot from the start, setting a Rockets record with 36 points in the first half, and he succeeded all game with his typical combination of 3-pointers (6 for 15) and free-throws (17 for 18). He also led all players in the game with nine rebounds and committed just five turnovers despite his outrageous level of usage.","The last time Harden scored fewer than 30 points was Dec. 11 in Houston’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, and he just barely missed the feat that night, with 29 points on 10 of 21 shooting. Since then he has averaged 41.3 points a game over the 17 games in which the Rockets, who got off to a poor start this season, have gone 13-4.","In the 17 games, Harden has topped 50 points twice and 40 points 10 times. He has also recorded five triple-doubles.","While Harden’s performance on Monday broke his tie with Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the N.B.A.’s longest single-season streak of 30-plus points by a player not named Chamberlain, Harden has a long way to go before catching Wilt.","Chamberlain had 30-point streaks, of 20, 25, 31 and 65 games in his career, according to Basketball-Reference.com. The longest one, which came during the 1961-62 season, is likely an unbreakable record, but it comes with an amusing footnote: In Chamberlain’s last game before the streak started, he was held to 28 points in a loss to Bill Russell’s Boston Celtics. When the streak finally ended more than three months later, Chamberlain was held to 26 points — in a loss to Russell’s Celtics.","As it currently stands, though, Harden does not appear to have a foil that can be his version of Russell, so there is no telling when this streak will end."
Lakers ‘Mutually’ Part Ways With Coach Luke Walton - The New York Times,LOS ANGELES — Vast upheaval within the Los Angeles Lakers organization continued on Friday afternoon when the team announced that Luke Walton was stepping down as coach.,"The Lakers said in a statement that Walton and the team had “mutually agreed to part ways,” without elaborating. The news came three days after Magic Johnson, the team’s president for basketball operations, made the surprise announcement that he was resigning so he could devote more time to his business interests.","Walton, 39, was in his third season with the Lakers, who were expected to vie for a playoff spot after signing LeBron James, a four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, to a four-year, $154 million contract last July. Instead, the Lakers scuffled to a 37-45 record after months of general dysfunction and momentum-sapping injuries. They finished 10th in the Western Conference, well out of playoff position.","The N.B.A.’s postseason will start Saturday but without the Lakers, whose postseason drought is now at six seasons. Not even the celebrated addition of James could salvage this one, but he missed significant time with a groin injury. And even when he was on the court, he appeared detached from his teammates as weeks of misery mounted.","The Lakers are fraught with problems. When Johnson announced that he was quitting this week, he indicated that he had been planning to fire Walton and that he had the support of Jeanie Buss, the team’s controlling owner, to go forward with the move. But then Johnson resigned — in part, he said, because he could not go through with affecting someone’s “livelihood.”","Hours later, after the Lakers had closed out their season with a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, Walton said that he was looking forward to an eventful summer with the team in hopes of making improvements. Now he is gone, too, though he may not be unemployed for long.","The Sacramento Kings immediately responded to Friday’s news by reaching out to Walton’s representatives to arrange an interview for their coaching vacancy, according to two people familiar with Sacramento’s plans who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Walton is considered the front-runner to replace Dave Joerger, whom the Kings fired this week.","Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, expressed his support for Walton, one of his former assistants.","“In this job, as a coach in the N.B.A., you are 100 percent dependent on your circumstances: the strength of your organization, the momentum, unity,” Kerr told reporters in Oakland, Calif. “Everything has to be in good order, because if it’s not, as we have witnessed with the Lakers, then there’s going to be casualties, and usually the coach is the first one.”",He added: “They’re losing one of the best humans in the N.B.A. They’re losing a guy who knows the game as well as anybody I’ve met. They’re losing somebody who players believe in.”,"Walton, the son of the Hall of Fame center Bill Walton, was working with an ill-conceived roster that lacked depth, defense and perimeter shooting. Still, the pressure was on him before the season even began. Once the Lakers got off to a slow start, Johnson chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting, raising speculation that Walton was already on the hot seat.","Questions about Walton’s job security persisted throughout the season as he shuffled rotations and lineups, searching for solutions that never materialized.","Walton refused to make excuses — publicly, he was a voice of unwavering optimism amid a sea of discontent — but it hardly helped that the Lakers were troubled by injuries, especially at point guard.","Then there was James, who had been incredibly durable in his 16-year career. But during the Lakers’ Christmas Day game against the Warriors, he limped off the court with a strained groin and missed the next 17 games. Without him, the Lakers struggled. The hope was that they could regain their footing once he returned, but he was not the cure-all anyone imagined. The Lakers continued to lose with James back in the lineup, even though he said he had “activated” himself for a playoff push.","It had become clear by then, however, that the Lakers did not have any discernible chemistry, especially after Johnson and Rob Pelinka, their general manager, tried and failed to acquire the All-Star center Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans ahead of February’s trade deadline. (It was no coincidence, perhaps, that Davis and James shared an agent, Rich Paul.) The Lakers were willing to send the Pelicans several of their promising young players, including Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball, but were rebuffed in their attempts to swing a blockbuster deal.","The result was a team that seemed distracted at best and fractured at worst. Before long, the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention. James did not dress for the final six games of the season.","Walton, who spent most of his 10-year N.B.A. playing career with the Lakers, winning two championships as a reserve forward, was hired as their coach in 2016 after two seasons as an assistant with the Warriors. In 2015-16, he began the season as the Warriors’ interim coach while Kerr recovered from debilitating back issues, and guided the team to a 39-4 record, which included a league-record 24 straight wins to start the season.","It was certainly an achievement, but the Warriors were coming off a championship and primed to excel. With the Lakers, Walton was trying to build something. Now, that vast project — however onerous — will continue without him."
The Knicks Get Razzed at the Oscars - The New York Times,And the Oscar goes to … the Knicks?,Not quite. But the team — and its woeful state as one of the worst teams in the N.B.A. — did get a shout out during the Academy Awards on Sunday night.,"When Samuel L. Jackson came out with Brie Larson to present the Best Adapted Screenplay award at the Oscars, he had a short preamble, a personal message to Spike Lee, a nominee and a famously devoted Knicks fan through thick and thin.","“First of all, Spike, so glad you’re sitting down,” Jackson began. “After 18 consecutive home losses, the Knicks won tonight. I repeat, the Knicks won tonight, defeated San Antonio, 130-118”",Jackson’s stats were accurate. The 18-game home losing streak had set a franchise record.,"Jackson’s news flash drew a laugh from Lee, and also an exclamation. It was not audible on the broadcast, but just about every armchair lip reader believed he said, “We’re trying to tank.”","While you might think that the end of a long losing streak would delight a superfan like Lee, there are those Knicks supporters out there who don’t especially want to win many — or any — more games.","If the Knicks finish in the bottom three of the N.B.A., they will get the best possible chance, 14 percent, to land the top draft pick in June. A recent injury aside, that is still expected to be the Duke star Zion Williamson. A bottom three finish would also give the Knicks a 40 percent chance at a top three pick.","As of Monday morning, the Knicks stand at 12-48, for the second worst record. Despite their win, they look likely to grab a bottom three spot, probably alongside the Phoenix Suns (11-50) and Cleveland Cavaliers (14-46). But the Chicago Bulls are looming, two games “better” than the Cavs.","The league actually changed the draft lottery percentages this season in an effort to cut down on tanking, particularly after the 76ers went on a multiyear losing period of terrible play that got them several top picks. A year ago, the worst record offered a full 25 percent chance at No. 1, with the second and third worst teams getting 20 and 16 percent chances.","Lee has been the Knicks’ consensus No. 1 fan for years, sitting courtside and not infrequently interacting with players on both teams. Perhaps most infamously, in 1994, he jawed with the Pacers’ Reggie Miller in a conference finals game. Miller went on to the lead the Pacers to victory, drawing a “Thanks a Lot Spike” headline from The New York Daily News.","Jackson and Lee have a history as well, with Jackson appearing in “Do the Right Thing,” “School Daze,” “Jungle Fever” and “Mo Better Blues.” They are also both alumni of Morehouse College.","In this age of smartphones, there’s a good chance that those at the Oscars who cared already knew the Knicks score, perhaps including Lee.","That wasn’t the case in 1976, when Elliott Gould, presenting the award for best editing, alerted the audience that Indiana had won the men’s basketball national championship, 86-68. “I listened to the score before we went out to make the presentation,” he told Grantland. “Literally in the wings, there was a radio there.”","By the way, along with his co-writers, Lee won on Sunday, his first competitive Oscar. There is no evidence that “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” or the other nominees engaged in any tanking."
The Knicks Were Broken From the Start - The New York Times,"Knicks Coach David Fizdale pulled at the edge of his graying beard as he dissected his team’s latest blowout loss. Leading a team that is now 10-42, the worst record in the N.B.A., Fizdale has had to search hard for traces of sunshine.","As he answered questions from reporters at a recent postgame news conference, the frames of his trademark glasses looked as broken as the franchise itself. The damaged black frames were held together by a glop of glue; Fizdale had cracked them earlier in the season.","It is easy to say now, but with 30 games remaining the Knicks seem to have been lost from the start. They began the season with the youngest roster in the N.B.A., with an average age of less than 24.5 years old. Development became the mantra with Fizdale, who in his first season as the Knicks head coach has frequently referred to his players as “kids.” Inexperience, a revolving-door rotation, and the absence of Kristaps Porzingis — the star forward who has been out injured since February 2018 — compounded the losing.","Now, after last week’s trade that sent Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks ended any hope that he might return to save the season, the Knicks could be in danger of finishing with the worst record in franchise history. The low mark was a 17-65 record during the 2014-15 season. They have lost 13 in a row, 25 of the last 27 and a franchise-record 14 consecutive games at home. Not surprisingly, they were 27th in the league in offensive rating and 28th in defensive rating entering Monday night’s games.","Of course, Knicks fans have become inured to the losing — this will be the team’s sixth consecutive season without a winning record. Other than the 2012-13 season, when the Knicks reached the Eastern Conference semifinals, it has been nearly two decades since the team advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs.","Newcomers like Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson and Allonzo Trier may be the future, but injuries and inconsistency have marred the present. Knox, the 6-foot-9 forward chosen ninth over all in last year’s draft, is one of the youngest players in the league, at 19. In December he earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors, but his 37.1 shooting percentage needs to improve.","The Knicks took a gamble on the 7-foot-1 Robinson when they selected him in the second round of June’s draft, 36th over all. He was the only player in last year’s draft who did not play in college, overseas or in the N.B.A.’s developmental league. Instead, Robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft.","Trier, a 6-foot-5 guard, went undrafted after three seasons at Arizona, but his early impressive play led to a two-year, $7 million deal with the Knicks.","The Knicks’ front office has been lauded for its savvy picks in last year’s draft and its recent acquisition of reclamation projects. That acumen will be tested in June. The Knicks, who own a first-round draft pick, will have the chance to select an impact player with their winning-by-losing approach.","The more they lose, the better their chances are of landing Duke’s Zion Williamson or another highly coveted prospect. Still, it is not a slam dunk — even if the Knicks fail to win 20 games this year. Being the worst team in the N.B.A. used to provide a greater advantage in the draft lottery. Because the league changed the rule to deter teams from tanking, the bottom three teams now share the same 14 percent odds of winning the No. 1 pick. Previously, the worst team held a 25 percent chance.","“Obviously, you always want to win. Every game we play we’re trying to win,” Fizdale has said.","But what if the Knicks actually did start winning, boosted by the three players acquired in the Porzingis trade with Dallas? The Knicks gained the promising guard Dennis Smith Jr., who was a first-round draft pick in 2017, and the expiring contracts of the veterans DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews, plus two future first-round picks. Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke were shipped to the Mavericks.","The Knicks’ newcomers knew only a few of the team’s offensive plays before making their debut against Memphis on Sunday, with Smith Jr. and Jordan starting. Both made standout plays early. Smith scored his first basket on a drive into the lane with an up-and-under layup and added another in a fast-break opportunity. Jordan registered a block, followed by an alley-oop dunk off an assist from Smith. All this competent basketball made some Knicks fans nervous, leading to some angst-ridden gallows humor on social media.","The Knicks held on for the loss, 96-84.","With Smith and Jordan in the starting lineup, the Knicks have continued their season theme of roster roulette. Fizdale has stitched together 57 five-man lineups that have played 10 or more minutes together this season. But of those groups, only five lineups have played 50 or more minutes together.","Consider center Enes Kanter, who started 23 games but lost his starting job as the team decided to focus on developing its younger players. He did not go quietly to the end of the bench. “I’ll go out and do my job and help my team win,” he said in late December. “If we’re winning, it’s good. But if we’re losing it’s a problem. If this adjustment is going to get us a win, cool. But if not, there’s a problem.”","But lately the most vocal cheer at Madison Square Garden has been, “We want Kanter!” as he sits on the bench. After four consecutive games in which he did not play, Kanter entered the game against Dallas last week, went to his knees and kissed the midcourt Garden logo. He explained later that he wanted to show his love for the fans since it could be one of his final games as a Knick, with the trade deadline looming.","In the second quarter against Memphis on Sunday, Fizdale looked down the bench and called for “Dennis,” referring to the newly acquired point guard Dennis Smith Jr. Kanter, however, heard “Enes” and started for the scorer’s table until he was stopped by the assistant coach Keith Smart.","“He wanted to run all the way to the scorer’s table, make it a bigger spectacle,” Fizdale said. But the damage, as it is with the Knicks, was already done."
"With Anthony Davis on His Way Out, New Orleans Tries to Plot Its Path - The New York Times","NEW ORLEANS — The New Orleans Pelicans have scuffled along for years as one of the N.B.A.’s worker-bee franchises, a respectable team but not one that has vied for championships. They lose as often as they win and play their home games in an arena called the Smoothie King Center, where a big-beaked mascot named Pierre roams the crowd.","But in recent seasons, the team has employed someone even more special: Anthony Davis, a gifted center and one of the best players in the league. Davis has a pterodactyl-length wingspan and a unibrow, which has become as much a part of his persona as his skyscraping dunks. Fans know him as “The Brow,” as if he were a superhero who draws strength from his facial hair.","New Orleans used to love him for it — until two weeks ago, when he shook the league and asked the Pelicans to trade him. The Pelicans, in return, made a bold move of their own: They refused to let him go, at least not yet.","Now Davis and New Orleans are stuck together in basketball purgatory — “It definitely is different,” said Jrue Holiday, the team’s starting point guard — and the city’s long-suffering sports fans can only wonder: What do we do now?","“It’s not a new thing that guys demand to be traded,” Alvin Gentry, the Pelicans coach, said in an interview, “but I thought the timing of it kind of put everybody in a tough situation.”","It has been a soul-crushing few weeks for sports fans here. They absorbed a major blow last month when the New Orleans Saints, who are as much a tent revival as football team, lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the N.F.L. playoffs after a missed call by the referees, which may have cost the Saints a trip to the Super Bowl.","A week later, Davis’s agent, Rich Paul, announced publicly that Davis wanted out of New Orleans and would not sign a contract extension.","“Now that he’s going to leave, I’m excited to see what we can get for him,” said Ryan Bergeron, a 22-year-old legal assistant from New Orleans who is a regular at Pelicans games. Like many fans, Bergeron owns one of Davis’s replica jerseys — which he plans to keep in the back of his closet.","“I think we’ll be better off without him,” Bergeron said.","Not so long ago, Davis was throwing beads from a float as an honorary grand marshal at a Mardi Gras parade. But the city’s feelings toward him have curdled like week-old étouffée.","On Friday night, when Davis played in his first home game for the Pelicans since his trade request, images of him were cut from a highlight package that played on the arena’s oversize video screens. The crowd showered him with boos that drowned out scattered cheers. As if to amplify his value while sticking it to those who expressed their displeasure, Davis collected 32 points and 9 rebounds.","“It’s life, man,” Davis said of his frosty reception. “Some people aren’t going to like you.”","New Orleans has dealt with its share of hardwood hardship. Franchises have come and gone, along with star players. The New Orleans Buccaneers were a charter member of the American Basketball Association from 1967 to 1970, but then relocated to Memphis. The New Orleans Jazz, founded as an N.B.A. expansion franchise in 1974, had a similarly abbreviated run before decamping for Utah in 1979.","The N.B.A. returned to New Orleans in 2002 — back when the team was known as the Hornets — and eventually found a franchise star in point guard Chris Paul, who led the team to three playoff appearances before he, too, told management before the start of the 2011-12 season that he would not sign a contract extension. New Orleans traded him to the Los Angeles Clippers, then finished with the worst record in the Western Conference.","But from the rubble of player discontent sprang fresh life in 2012: Tom Benson, then the owner of the Saints, bought the franchise, and the team, soon to be rebranded as the Pelicans, secured the top pick in the draft. (After Benson died last year, the ownership of both franchises was transferred to his wife, Gayle.) New Orleans used that pick on Davis, a freshman center who had just led Kentucky to an N.C.A.A. championship.","Now in his seventh season, Davis is a six-time All-Star who was averaging 29 points and 13.3 rebounds entering Monday. But he has been prone to injury, and he has never led the Pelicans on a deep playoff run. The organization has made missteps — Exhibit A: re-signing Omer Asik, a Turkish forward, to a $58 million deal in 2015 — but that does not make them unique among N.B.A. teams; they are trying to compete in one of the league’s smallest markets when stars are generally gravitating toward flashier and more well-established franchises.","Last season, the Pelicans were playing well behind Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, a perennial All-Star whom the team had acquired through a trade in 2017. But Cousins tore his Achilles’ tendon and missed the playoffs. Without him, the Pelicans still swept the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round series before losing to the Golden State Warriors in the conference semifinals.","Still another problem was brewing for the Pelicans. In September, Davis changed agents and hired Paul, who is known for his close relationship with LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers’ star forward.","Paul’s tactics with the Pelicans in recent weeks in pursuit of a trade for Davis were unconventional. Tom Penn, a former executive with the Trail Blazers and an analyst for NBA TV, said in a telephone interview that most agents try to work with team executives behind the scenes. Paul, on the other hand, “threw a Molotov cocktail in the middle of the room,” Penn said.","It became a public spectacle, and the Pelicans responded by releasing a statement in which they said they would do a deal “on our own terms and our own timeline.” Sure enough, they rebuffed the Lakers — one of Davis’s preferred trade destinations — in their attempts to pry Davis loose.","Once Thursday’s trade deadline passed, the Pelicans landed a final jab by tweeting an emoji of an hourglass that had run out.","Aside from avoiding the public-relations pitfalls of being stuck with a star who no longer wants to be there, the Pelicans had little incentive to make a deal ahead of the trade deadline. More teams will be better positioned to make offers for Davis in the off-season, and the Pelicans’ haul in exchange for him could be huge.","New Orleans also showed some pluck. At a time when some players are seizing greater power to determine the arc of their careers, the Pelicans decided that they would trade Davis when they are ready.","Now, with Davis tethered to them for the remainder of the season — he is a lottery ticket they will wait to cash — the Pelicans are searching for a way forward.","“What we’re trying to do is get back to normal,” said Gentry, the team’s coach, “and what our new normal is — we haven’t quite figured it out yet.”"
"Porzingis and Mavericks Project Business as Usual, Even if It Isn’t - The New York Times","DALLAS — Moments before the home team was introduced on Monday night, Kristaps Porzingis made his usual walk behind the scorer’s table to take a seat on the Dallas Mavericks’ bench at American Airlines Center.","Wearing a three-piece olive suit and a maroon tie, Porzingis saluted a friendly face in the crowd and proceeded to what has become his customary vantage point. It was Porzingis’s 13th home game as a spectator since Dallas acquired him from the Knicks on Feb. 1, as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury he sustained in February 2018.","Porzingis, in other words, projected normalcy in his first public appearance since it emerged that he is under investigation by law enforcement authorities in New York City over an accusation that he sexually assaulted a woman there.","As the Mavericks reveled in an unforeseen 16 points and 14 rebounds from the reserve center Salah Mejri, Porzingis was right in the heart of multiple bench celebrations. Coach Rick Carlisle had given Porzingis the option of taking personal time away from the team to escape the glare of the spotlight, but Porzingis declined. He wants to keep practicing, Carlisle said, and uphold his rooting routine through the final five games of the Mavericks’ third successive season of missing the playoffs.","These, of course, are not normal times for the Mavericks — not when Porzingis, whom they acquired just 60 days ago to serve as a cornerstone for the franchise alongside the electric Slovene rookie Luka Doncic, is facing such grave allegations.","Porzingis’s lawyer, Roland G. Riopelle, “unequivocally” denied the accusation and revealed that he formally referred the accuser to the F.B.I. in December for what he termed her “extortionate demands.”","The New York Police Department and the Manhattan district attorney’s office have confirmed an investigation is underway, but representatives have declined to comment further. The woman filed a complaint on Thursday that accused Porzingis of sexually assaulting her in his Manhattan apartment on Feb. 7, 2018 — mere hours after he sustained the debilitating knee injury.",The woman did not respond to several phone calls requesting comment.,For the Mavericks — one season removed from a sexual harassment scandal that led to multiple firings and an overhaul of the franchise’s business and human resources departments — the case has invited fresh scrutiny of a trade for a marquee player who is the subject of a serious criminal complaint.,"Complicating matters for the Mavericks is their assertion that they cannot comment on the investigation. Before Monday’s unexpected victory over the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers, the Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, reiterated to a group of reporters that the team was told by federal authorities not to comment about the case. The F.B.I. declined to comment.","“I’ve got nothing to say — n-o-t-h-i-n-g,” Cuban said, spelling out the word and repeating a stance he has maintained since the allegations against Porzingis were first revealed Saturday night. “When I said federal authorities said for us not to comment, they were being serious.”","Cuban and other Mavericks officials have referred all Porzingis-related questions to the N.B.A. The league office, however, has not responded to requests for further elaboration from The New York Times beyond its brief initial statement, from the N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass, that “we are aware of the situation.”",Riopelle said he had provided the district attorney’s office with materials that show the woman attempted to extort Porzingis.,"“We are confident that after the district attorney reviews these materials, they will recognize that the complaint in this case is completely meritless,” Riopelle said.","Porzingis’s camp has received public backing from Michele Roberts, executive director of the National Basketball Players Association and a former trial lawyer.","“We have been aware of these allegations for some time, have evaluated the accuser’s claims and, based on what is presently before us, stand with Kristaps,” Roberts said in a statement.","The New York Times reported on Saturday that before the trade, the Knicks made the Mavericks aware of a potential “extortion issue” with Porzingis. One person briefed on the trade call between the teams and who was not authorized to discuss it publicly expressed the belief on Monday that the N.B.A. would not have allowed the trade to go through if the case against Porzingis appeared to be strong.","It appears that the N.B.A. is letting that investigation play out or awaiting further developments before deciding on any action against Porzingis — although the league, under the terms of its joint policy with the players’ association on matters of sexual assault, can place players on administrative leave in these situations if it sees fit.","Dallas had aggressively pursued the trade for Porzingis, a 7-foot-3 forward from Latvia, with an open determination to sign him to a new five-year maximum contract worth an estimated $158 million in July. Cuban declined to answer on Monday night when a reporter asked if the Mavericks remained eager to sign Porzingis to such a lucrative contract.","Not much with the Mavericks is clear at the moment, although Carlisle insisted to the news media before the Philadelphia game that “basketballwise, it’s business as usual,” no matter what is swirling around Porzingis. Dallas then went out and took advantage of the sidelined Joel Embiid (knee) and Jimmy Butler (back) to follow up Sunday afternoon’s win at Oklahoma City — despite Doncic’s injury absence — with a 122-102 rout of the 76ers.",“Did we look distracted?” Carlisle said.
Relationship Advice From Two Who Have Withstood the Test of Time and Rhyme - The New York Times,"Attention, couples everywhere: We’ve got some relationship advice from a New York couple who shared a familiar table in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night, celebrating their 20th anniversary.",Beyoncé and Jay-Z? Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick? Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld?,Nope. Nope. Nope.,Mike Breen and Walt Frazier (known as Clyde)?,Yep and yep.,"However, their table was not covered with a white linen tablecloth and candles, but rather statistics sheets, laptops and a video monitor.","Mr. Breen, 57, and Mr. Frazier, his 73-year-old partner-in-rhyme, have been a New York Knicks broadcasting team on MSG Networks for two decades.","They recently discussed the keys to maintaining their rock-solid relationship, which began on television on Feb. 5, 1999, at Orlando, back when Mr. Frazier was a precocious neophyte (a phrase he uses to describe promising rookies, which happens to be one of Mr. Breen’s favorite Frazierisms).","“To me, the most important aspects of any partnership are respect and concern,” said Mr. Frazier, an All-Star guard in his heyday — he was voted one of the 50 greatest players ever — who led the Knicks to their two N.B.A. titles, in 1970 and 1973.","“Mike and I not only have a mutual respect, but we care about each other, and each other’s families,” said Mr. Frazier, who lives in Harlem with his longtime girlfriend, Patricia James. “I know that if I had a problem personally or professionally, Mike would be the first one there for me, and vice versa.”","Rosanne Breen, who in September will celebrate an even longer time with Mr. Breen (their 30th wedding anniversary), said that listening to her husband and Mr. Frazier on the air “is like listening to a couple of relatives chatting on the phone.”","“My favorite aspect of their relationship is how kind they are to one another, and how their admiration for each other comes across specifically through humor,” Ms. Breen said. “I think at least once a broadcast there’s some sort of very organic and natural interaction between them that ends up with one of them belly laughing, and I find that makes the broadcast really pleasant to listen to.”","Mr. Frazier, who is better known to a legion of younger hoops fans for his colorful wardrobe and lyrical analysis — “The Knicks were crashing and dashing in the first half, now they’re stumbling and bumbling,” he said during a telecast earlier this season and possibly many other times this season — was again seated alongside Mr. Breen at the Knicks broadcast table on Tuesday when the Detroit Pistons arrived at Madison Square Garden.","Mr. Breen, a lifelong Knicks fan whose sports idol was, and still is, Mr. Frazier, said that “maintaining a sense of humor” has also been crucial to achieving their long-term success.","“We both enjoy laughing together on the air,” said Mr. Breen, who noted that an action poster of Mr. Frazier still hangs in the bedroom of the Westchester home where he grew up, and where his mother lives.","“Obviously what we are talking about is important, it’s basketball, it’s the Knicks,” said Mr. Breen, who now lives on Long Island. “But to have some fun while we’re working, that’s been a real key over the years.”","And when situations arise that are no laughing matter, they know they can agree to disagree.","“In all honesty, Mike and I have never had an argument off the air, but we’ve disagreed on-air,” Mr. Frazier said. “When that happens, we take off the headsets and remind each other that we have our own opinions, and then one of us will usually say something like, ‘Hey man, that was good,’ and we move on.”","Mr. Breen said that he and Mr. Frazier also “understand the importance of being good listeners, and knowing when to let each other speak.”","“It’s never a good idea for any two people to try and talk over one another,” Mr. Breen said. “There are certain things that I will bring up that Clyde knows I’m passionate about, and he lets me have my space.","“And when he’s talking about something he’s passionate about I just sit back and let him go, and the viewer gets analysis from one of the greatest players of all-time, as beloved an athlete as we have ever had in any sport, someone who has taught the game to generations of fans.”","To Mr. Frazier, it’s all a part of the job. “A job that I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do,” he said.","“Mike’s the play-by-play man, and I’m the color analyst,” he said. “I know that he always goes first, he leads and I follow. It’s no different than having a dance partner.”","Mr. Breen and Mr. Frazier both said that at the root of every solid relationship is a solid friendship, like theirs.","“It’s hard for me to believe that the athlete I admired most when I was growing up is now my broadcast partner and best friend,” Mr. Breen said. “My wife just loves the sound of Clyde’s voice and when my kids come to the Garden and come by to say hello after games, he treats them like his own family.","“That was my dad’s favorite thing, coming by after games and hanging out with Clyde,” said Mr. Breen, whose voice went silent for a moment before cracking with emotion. “When my dad passed away, Clyde came to his wake, and the way he treated my mother that night, well, these are things you never forget, these are things that really tell you about a person.”",Mr. Frazier let his play-by-play man have his space before bringing a smile to his longtime partner’s face.,"“You know, Mike, when we first started out together I remember you telling me, ‘Hey, Clyde, just be yourself, say whatever you want to say,’” Mr. Frazier said. “I know you’re regretting that now, 20 years later.”"
Brooklyn Wins Bragging Rights to the World’s Tallest Politician - The New York Times,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],"New York already holds Guinness World Records for the most billionaires and for being the most Instagrammed city. Now the city can claim another record: the world’s tallest politician, thanks to Robert Cornegy Jr., a city councilman who represents Brooklyn.","A former professional basketball player who was part of the 1984-85 St. John’s University men’s basketball team that advanced to the Final Four, Mr. Cornegy, 53, officially tops out at 6-foot-10, according to an average of measurements provided by three doctors at Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.","“What I went through to get this measurement was borderline ridiculous,” said Mr. Cornegy, who will receive the designation on Wednesday at a ceremony at City Hall. “But I think it was worth it to bring that designation to New York — and Brooklyn.”","Getting certified as “the world’s tallest politician (male)” was no easy feat. Guinness requires the record-holder to submit official height verification. Mr. Cornegy went to his former trainer at St. John’s University, but Guinness did not like the tools the trainer used. He then turned to the doctors at Interfaith, which is in his Council district.","Mr. Cornegy received three measurements on the same day in January, but at different times and in varied poses. “Medically, there can be variations in height depending on certain factors,” said Dr. Mazin Khalid, who has practiced internal medicine at Interfaith for five years and provided one of the measurements.","Mr. Cornegy’s height was recorded while he was lying on the floor, which generally produces a greater measurement because it relieves pressure on the vertebrae, and while he was standing with his heels and shoulders against a wall.","“He’s very tall,” Dr. Khalid said. “It took three people to take the measurement.”","Guinness officials said Mr. Cornegy is now the official record-holder, besting Sir Louis Gluckstein, a London politician who died in 1979, by two and a half inches. (The most recent record-holder was Archie Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 former member of the British Parliament, who slightly eclipses another New Yorker: the almost 6-foot-6 Mayor Bill de Blasio.)","“When I first started this, I said there is no way I’m the tallest politician in the world. There must be an ambassador in Africa who is seven feet,” said Mr. Cornegy. “But when I found out the previous record-holder was only 6 foot 7 inches, I had to give it a shot.”","Being that tall has personal costs. Mr. Cornegy paid a contractor to put his toilet at home on an eight-inch platform. “I want to see what it’s like for my feet to swing,” he said.","Custom suits cost $700 and stylish shoes, at size 17, are at least $400, he said. Most cars are too small, so Mr. Cornegy rides the subway from his district in Bedford-Stuyvesant to City Hall. But unless he can get a seat, he spends most of the ride hunched over.","“I have a moment of anxiety when the train pulls into the station,” he said.","When talking to constituents, Mr. Cornegy, who has a master’s degree in organizational leadership, has learned to stand back at least three feet to make it easier for people to look up at him.","Mr. de Blasio is the only local politician who comes close to seeing Mr. Cornegy eye to eye. The mayor was signing a bill in 2014 when Mr. Cornegy, then newly elected, walked into the room. “Look who’s here. Rob Cornegy, my archnemesis,” Mr. Cornegy recalled the mayor saying. But the two tallest men in New York politics get along pretty well.","“I look up to Council member Robert Cornegy, because of his contributions to our city, and because I don’t really have a choice,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.","It is entirely possible that in some corner of the world, an elected official may be even taller than Mr. Cornegy; Guinness record holders generally self-report their feats of stature. Indeed, beneath the Guinness online entry for Mr. Cornegy, two commenters suggested that a member of the Croatian parliament, Pedja Grbin, deserved the record; he is listed in some accounts as being 6-foot-11.","But Mr. Cornegy is safe from one potential challenger: Glenn Jacobs, the former professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now a mayor in Tennessee. His wrestling biography suggested he was seven feet tall, but he has said in interviews that he is 6-foot-8.","Now Mr. Cornegy, who is the chairman of the Housing and Buildings Committee, has his sights on other goals. He was in the running to become the speaker of the City Council in 2017, but he failed to garner enough support, falling to Corey Johnson. Mr. Cornegy, who by law must leave the Council when his current term expires, said he plans to run for Brooklyn borough president in 2021.",He said he hopes his world record might inspire young people.,"“Being the world’s tallest politician shows you can make tremendous contributions to society, no matter how you look physically,” Mr. Cornegy said."
"Behold the Knicks. Or Better Yet, Start Rooting for the Nets. - The New York Times","Unhappy with mere tanking, displeased with their success at earning the N.B.A.’s worst record, the Knicks took Kristaps Porzingis, their once-in-a-generation asset, their most, and perhaps only, popular player, and traded him to the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday for potsherds and trinkets.","Actually, point of information: Porzingis was not even the center of the transaction. The Knicks tossed him in as a sweetener to persuade the Mavericks to also take the putative shooting guard Tim Hardaway and his frightful contract. It was Steve Mills, the team president, whose feel for failure is bred in the bone, who handed Hardaway that $70.9 million deal two years ago. Now Mills and the rest of the Knicks’ vaunted leadership group have traded Porzingis to get rid of it.","Had I been able to reach Mark Cuban, the Mavericks’ owner, for comment on his Porzingis heist, I can only assume he would have dissolved into uncontrollable laughter.","We live in a national age of delusion and unapologetic rule-breaking, so perhaps there is a pleasingly nefarious explanation for this trade. If so, Knicks management should cling to it like a barnacle on the hull of a sinking ship. Perhaps the Knicks have successfully tampered with another team’s asset and know that Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving, or both, will sign in the summer now that the franchise has plenty of cap space.",But I would put the chances that the Knicks could pull off something that clever and diabolical at 6.82 percent. When in doubt it is wisest to bank on inexplicable incompetence.,"Porzingis apparently helped set all this off by requesting a trade. As a 7-foot-3 23-year-old coming off a serious knee injury, he represented a conundrum for management. Do you commit this summer to a long-term contract of the sort that would tickle the tummy of Croesus? Let’s assume the Knicks’ crack medical and rehabilitation staff warned that his future looked iffy.","If so, why wouldn’t Knicks management dangle Porzingis for a week or more to interested teams and let natural competitive instincts come into play around the league? When healthy, Porzingis is a top 20 player, and that made him a rare asset. Instead, the Knicks traded him posthaste for the aging center DeAndre Jordan and a talented, but raw, point guard, Dennis Smith Jr. The Knicks already have raw point guards, so maybe management succumbed to a collect-them-all fever.",All theories and psychological analyses are welcome.,"I’ve followed the Knicks for decades now, and my sons soon contracted my affliction. Like residents in a smallpox ward we often debate whether we have divined one obscure reason or another for faint hope, which is why I hopped the subway a week ago and went to Barclays Center to watch the Knicks take on the Brooklyn Nets.","It was a desultory affair at times, but it did feature a Nets team that is climbing in the standings with surprising speed, in contrast to the Knicks, who are hurtling happily downward. And the Nets played like men returned from a near-death experience, happily surprised to possess a winning record after four losing seasons in the Hades of the N.B.A.","To his credit, the Nets’ general manager, Sean Marks, has executed a smart rebuild with a fishmonger’s eye for plucking useful talent out of the discard pool. The Nets play a swarming defense with a collective bounce, and their wait-who-is-that-guy no-names are long on desire and short on distorting egos. It was possible to daydream that if only they could sign a Durant or a Kawhi Leonard as a free agent, the Nets could be a genuine terror in the Eastern Conference.","The Knicks offer terror of a different sort. They decided this season to double down on what they have done instinctually for so many years and devote their energies to pure losing. They are superb at it. Entering Friday’s game against Boston, their record stood at 10-40, which assures them a high draft pick in June.","The modern N.B.A. is an upstairs-downstairs league and runs a two-tier competition: The upstairs version is staged by the top 10 or so teams and is all about winning and praying that your team will not face the Golden State Warriors until late in the playoffs, at which point you will be excused for exiting quickly and feet first.","The downstairs version involves a half-dozen teams, and the point is to become the worst of the worst and pray you can draft a young stud who will turn around your franchise. The worst-run teams return year after year to this brackish well. This is the game at which the Knicks currently excel.","And there is indeed much unlovely about these Knicks. Their defense occupies a netherworld between theoretical and clueless. Their now-traded shooting guard, Hardaway, appeared to have had his conscience surgically removed and would shoot anywhere at any time and none too successfully.","And yet, and yet, I thought these Knicks offered a rough hope. They have the youngest team in the league, a group of foals, and a few might even possess lasting talent. Put them together with Porzingis, and something intriguing might emerge.","Friends resisted these optimistic blandishments, and I dug that. In James Dolan, the Knicks have an owner who meddles and hires and fires team presidents and coaches like a mad king. In the past 17 seasons, the Knicks finished with a winning record precisely twice. This one will be no better.","Still, I felt hope. The new coach, David Fizdale, is a clever basketball man who seemed O.K. with playing dorm father to a collection of teenagers. This week, Fizdale pointed to the Philadelphia 76ers, the Denver Nuggets and, yes, the Nets as young teams that weathered harrowing days and re-emerged in solid shape.","“All of these teams went through hell,” Fizdale said. “You got to get steeled up. This league is not going to let you walk in here as a young team and just think you’re going to come out winning.”","Not long after those remarks, the Knicks traded Porzingis. My eldest son, Nick, a fierce dead-ender on the question of team loyalties, is now recommending a family summit with a single agenda item: to switch or not to switch to the Nets?",This feels almost as inconceivable as trading a 23-year-old star-in-the-making for potsherds.,Mission accomplished all around.
What Better Muse than James Harden’s Beard? - The New York Times,"Filip Peraić was in a rut. A freelance illustrator bored of his contract work, he had hoped to reignite his love of art through a long-term personal project.","It made sense that Peraić, 30, who is from the basketball-obsessed city of Zadar, Croatia, would come up with a project related to the N.B.A. But instead of taking a broad look at his favorite players, or honoring his country’s many N.B.A. stars, Peraić decided to do something more specific — remarkably so. His project would consist entirely of portraits of James Harden’s head in profile, from the right side of the Houston Rockets star’s face.","Suddenly Harden, who is known for his distinctive beard, existed in portrait form — as a tribute to Jackson Pollock in one of Peraić’s works and as a tribute to Wassily Kandinsky in another. There was one in the style of a medical illustration, and another that was a map of the fictional country of Hardenia. His beard became a giant whale, and it took on the distinctive curls of a Greek philosopher. In one particularly disturbing image, Harden’s face was replicated with human hair. ","In all, Peraić’s project, which came to be known as James Harden Illustrated, had 26 images, each one seemingly more bizarre than the previous one.","“The best portraits are when I surprise myself,” Peraić said in a telephone interview. “I’m thinking about James Harden’s head constantly — it’s my passion project.”","With Harden in the middle of a remarkable season, in which he is almost certain to finish with the highest scoring average of any player in N.B.A. history besides Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan, Peraić is set to release another batch of the illustrations. The first was posted Thursday, and there will be one released each week for the next seven weeks, thus carrying Peraić’s followers into the playoffs.","On Tuesday, in hopes of showcasing the existing work in advance of the new batch, Peraić tweeted out a thread of the 26 original images, which were completed from 2013 to 2017. The thread caught fire and was shared and favorited thousands of times.","Peraić said the attention the posts received was gratifying, but he was especially excited by certain people who noticed them.","He referred to a few journalists who shared the post, then mentioned two people who favorited the thread: Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, and Kirk Goldsberry, a former San Antonio Spurs executive. “That’s really cool because as an N.B.A. geek, I follow these people constantly,” Peraić said. “To see them reacting to my work is really rewarding.”","Then there was Harden. He was once interviewed on TNT with a poster of Peraić’s portraits behind him. But other than that, Peraić did not know how Harden felt about the work. That changed Wednesday afternoon. ","Harden tweeted six of the images, reacting to each with emoji. “Yo @filiperaic,” Harden wrote in the first of the series of tweets, “these are dope!”","Beyond rubbing elbows online with his N.B.A. heroes, Peraić has experienced tangible career benefits from the project. Recently, he worked on a series of images for the singer-songwriter Leon Bridges, and while the images may not have Harden’s beard in them, they are clearly in the same vein as the Harden project.","The rut he had found himself in career-wise, it seemed, had created an opportunity.","“I started this project just for my own pleasure and to try something else because I wasn’t satisfied with the kind of work I was getting,” Peraić said. “Now art directors come up to me and say, ‘We want this kind of James Harden portrait.’”","Amusingly enough, considering how much time Peraić spends thinking about Harden, the Rockets guard is not, and has never been, the illustrator’s favorite player. He mentioned living near the city in Croatia where Drazen Petrovic, the Hall of Famer, grew up, and said he had always preferred Manu Ginobili and Kobe Bryant over Harden.","“People think that I’m obsessed with James Harden, and that’s really not the case,” he said. “I just wanted to pick someone that had an interesting face that was easily recognizable.”","Of the original batch of portraits, Peraić said his favorites were one comprising a single line and another in which Harden’s profile had morphed into a thermal image of an approaching hurricane.","“I like repetition, and I’m a bit stubborn,” he said when asked how he could keep coming back to the same image. “When I made a couple of them I thought, ‘This is really interesting.’ It’s a challenge for me.”","The images can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to complete, with one in which Harden’s profile was recreated using only flowers and other vegetation representing the high-water mark for effort so far. The project requires enough time that it has regularly run up against Peraić’s contract work, which forced the recent pause in his output. He acknowledged that of the eight works planned for the new batch, only six are complete so far.","When he finishes the final two, that will bring the project to 34 portraits. Until the next one.","“I feel that this is a never-ending project,” Peraić said. “Maybe if James Harden shaves his beard, that would be the end.”"
The N.C.A.A. Tournament’s Forgotten Favorite? It’s Villanova - The New York Times,"Amid all the breathless chatter these days about Zion Williamson and Duke being favored to win the N.C.A.A. Tournament, which begins next week, it is easy to forget that Villanova is the reigning champion and will remain so until — and only if — it is dethroned.","“For everybody who doesn’t think that Villanova’s still one of the elite teams in the country — wait till they play them,” Providence Coach Ed Cooley said after his team lost to the Wildcats in the Big East tournament on Thursday.","This has been a season of transition at Villanova, but in many ways it has been a lot like the last few that came before it. Despite having lost four players to the N.B.A. from last season’s N.C.A.A. title team — Villanova’s second championship in the past three years — the Wildcats won the Big East regular-season crown for the fifth time in six years. A win in this week’s conference tournament at Madison Square Garden would be their fourth in five years. Two Wildcats — guard Phil Booth and forward Eric Paschall — were unanimous selections to the all-Big East team this week, and a third starter — forward Saddiq Bey — made the all-freshman squad.","Yet when experts list the top contenders to lift the N.C.A.A. championship trophy, they often start with Duke and its star freshmen, Williamson and R. J. Barrett; the Blue Devils’ Atlantic Coast Conference rivals Virginia and North Carolina; perpetually competitive Kentucky; and top-ranked Gonzaga. Those lists rarely run deep enough to include Villanova.","“We see it all,” Coach Jay Wright said. “And we always tell them, if we’re not getting any attention right now, it’s fine. But we’re not thinking we’re not any good because of it.”","Wright’s expectations for this season had to be adjusted even before it began. Entering last year’s N.C.A.A. Tournament, Wright expected to lose two of his best players, Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson, to the N.B.A. draft. But after the Wildcats beat Michigan in the final, two underclassmen — forward Omari Spellman and guard Donte DiVincenzo — decided to turn professional as well.","Had Spellman and DiVincenzo returned, Villanova probably would have been favored to repeat as national champion. Even if only one had come back, Villanova would have been among the favorites. Instead, all four players were selected in the first 33 picks of the draft.","That changed the calculus for Wright. In recent years, Villanova had built its success by redshirting players — last year’s roster featured seven, including Bridges, Spellman and DiVincenzo — who had taken a year to learn Wright’s system and the team’s methods without competing in games. But the departures of four key players in one off-season forced Wright to adapt on the fly.","To compensate for a sudden lack of depth, Wright did something he rarely does: He added a graduate transfer, the former Albany guard Joe Cremo, who offered experience and scoring in the backcourt. And then he told Booth and Eric Paschall, two redshirt seniors, that he would expect more from them.","The rebuilt Wildcats have struggled at times. Villanova has lost nine games this season after losing only four all of last year. It opened the season with a 27-point home loss to Michigan in a game that was billed as a national championship rematch, and it later endured two sets of back-to-back losses and a recent three-game losing streak.","Still, Booth and Paschall have steadied the ship; they are now the Wildcats’ leading scorers.","“I couldn’t be more proud of them,” Wright said, adding: “They had a really difficult task in our program this year with a lot of new guys. Not just leading them but being patient with them and teaching them.”","Along with Booth and Paschall, Wright has had to rely heavily on the sophomore Collin Gillespie, who has seamlessly taken over the point guard duties once held by Brunson. “He’s a sophomore,” Wright said, “and we’re kind of treating him like a senior.”","Regardless of what happens this weekend or over the next few weeks, though, Villanova’s future looks bright. Wright, 57, is one of two active Division I men’s coaches eligible this year for the basketball hall of fame, and he is widely expected to get in. And new talent is already on the way: The lure of two recent national titles has helped Wright lock up perhaps the country’s best recruiting class for 2019.","Whether this Villanova team can match the success of its recent predecessors before those players arrive remains to be seen. The Wildcats beat fourth-seeded Xavier, 71-67, in overtime Friday night to advance to Saturday’s conference title game against Seton Hall, which defeated Marquette in the other semifinal.",So Wright and his team might be posing with a trophy while they await their N.C.A.A. seed on Sunday night.,What they do from there could have everyone talking about the N.C.A.A.’s forgotten favorites again.
"For Anthony Davis and the Pelicans, the Solution Is to Stop Playing Games - The New York Times","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Some of the most memorable scenes from the N.B.A.’s 68th All-Star Game played out away from the ball, both on and adjacent to the bench of the squad captained by LeBron James.",Two very deep 3-pointers from Damian Lillard sparked a comeback from 20 points down that had some of the game’s biggest names bounding farther onto the floor in the celebration than the rules would ever allow in a game that counts. ,"And in that same corner of Spectrum Center, another spectacle percolated: Anthony Davis, the disgruntled New Orleans Pelicans superstar, spending the entire second half as a rather forlorn spectator.",Those close enough to see it simply couldn’t miss the contrast.,"Davis tested his freshly tweaked left shoulder in warm-ups, registered 5 points in five minutes and then opted for safety — and what passed for solitude — while a raucous rally unfolded around him. ","Led by Lillard and the All-Star M.V.P. Kevin Durant, Team LeBron climbed out of that huge hole to record a 178-164 victory over the team captained by Giannis Antetokounmpo. ",Yet it was a muted end to the league’s annual party weekend for the player whose future has generated more noise than anyone or anything in basketball since September. That’s when Davis hired the Klutch Sports agent Rich Paul — who is also James’s agent and one of the superstar’s closest friends — to precipitate a seemingly ceaseless stream of chatter about Davis winding up alongside James on the Los Angeles Lakers. ,That might still happen. Even though the league’s annual trade deadline has passed — and even with Davis revealing in a wild interview session Saturday that he is more open to being dealt to the Boston Celtics than had been previously described — no one is prepared to suggest that the Lakers are out of this trade chase.,The firmest and smartest declaration to be made at this juncture is that Davis’s reverse layup and swished 3-pointer from the left wing Sunday night should be the last two shots he takes for the rest of the season. ,"It is time for the Pelicans, league officials and Davis’s camp to collectively decide that the wisest move for all parties is to shelve The Brow for New Orleans’ 23 remaining games.","Davis has every right, like countless All-Stars before him, to request a trade. The sport’s best have anointed James their muscle-flexing role model and are taking greater control of their futures than ever before. Why shouldn’t they if they have the juice?","Once that happens, though, Davis’s team should be able to protect the franchise’s interests above anything else. New Orleans has not been granted that right.","It emerged Jan. 28 that Davis, through Paul, informed the Pelicans that he would not be signing the five-year, $240 million contract extension they were planning to offer July 1, and that he wanted to be traded instead. New Orleans spent the ensuing 10 days before the trade deadline fielding offers for Davis — mostly from the overzealous Lakers — but did so knowing all along that the pool of worthy offers would be wider if they waited until June.","When the deadline predictably passed on Feb. 7 with no deal, New Orleans was ordered by the N.B.A. to play Davis for the rest of the season — even though a precedent had already been set to give the team full control in similar cases involving Houston’s Carmelo Anthony and Memphis’ Chandler Parsons. Davis has played in four games since, routinely taking the proverbial air out of the Pelicans when he’s been on the court and, in his most recent appearance, injuring his shoulder.","The Pelicans don’t want Davis in the lineup because of the gloom his ongoing presence spawns, but also to try to avoid a serious injury that could adversely affect his trade value. The N.B.A.’s position is that they differentiate between true game-changers like Davis and mortal players. It is my position that they absolutely should not.","Two of the league’s main justifications in this case, after all, hold that the Pelicans would be willfully hurting the ticket-buying public by holding Davis out — and that the potential benefit New Orleans could realize in terms of improving its draft lottery odds in May violates “league rules governing competitive integrity.” Both ring increasingly hollow.",The toxic atmosphere at New Orleans home games — where some customers were spotted last week wearing paper bags over their heads in a scene straight out of the depressing New Orleans ’Aints days of yesteryear — is suddenly such that playing Davis is also an affront to Pelicans fans. They know their face of the franchise no longer wants to be there.,"Rival teams, meanwhile, can whine all they want about the Pelicans supposedly trying to improve their draft pick in June by sitting Davis now. The truth is any team in New Orleans’ position, resigned to trading Davis and getting as much as possible in return, would want to put him in bubble wrap as quickly as possible.","Davis made it clear Sunday night after his quiet cameo that he still wants to play out the season. As much as N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver wants the same, Silver conceded in an interview Sunday with ESPN Radio that the awkward dance resulting from Davis’s trade demand had indeed “become a distraction.”","“It’s a very unhealthy situation for the team and, frankly, for Anthony as well,” Silver said.","Call that the polite description. The TNT analysts Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, both of whom navigated their own complicated trade sagas as players, were openly critical of Davis and Paul throughout their All-Star duty.","“I think they probably should have done it this summer and done it a little bit more quietly,” O’Neal said in an off-set interview. “Because now Anthony Davis is in a bad position. As a player, you never want the fans to think you don’t care.”","Even after Davis hired Paul, I expected a scenario closer to what Shaq outlined. I thought Davis would play the season out to his fullest, inform the Pelicans he would pass on the extension and thus force them to trade him without ever explicitly requesting a trade. That approach seemingly would have meshed better with Davis’s reserved personality. The path he chose instead has made the previously beloved Davis an unlikely villain. ","That, too, shall pass with time. Paul George, Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard are fellow elite talents who have found themselves labeled similarly over the past 18 months. After Davis is ultimately traded in July, it will eventually be someone else who becomes the N.B.A.’s villain.","But July is a ways off. Although there’s no way to gain real distance from the Davis distraction until a trade materializes, Pelicans officials believe it can be tangibly diminished by sending him away for the rest of the season — especially with two of New Orleans’ first four games after the All-Star break coming against LeBron’s Lakers.",There were strong signals in Charlotte that the Pelicans — with Danny Ferry now serving as their acting general manager in the wake of Friday’s firing of Dell Demps — intend to re-engage the N.B.A. this week in hopes of convincing league officials to rethink their stance about forcing them to play Davis.,"The N.B.A. Players Association would presumably get involved if New Orleans is successful, but I’d advise the Pelicans to hold firm. Take any fine that comes. The team has played better, scrappier ball without Davis anyway — and heaven forbid he suffers a serious injury in the regular season’s dog days. ","As opposed to a mere “dumpster fire,” to borrow New Orleans Coach Alvin Gentry’s term, that would leave both Davis and the Pelicans far worse off than forlorn. That would be the sports version of catastrophic."
Barely Drawing a Whisper Where Hockey Is the Talk of the Town - The New York Times,"Vacant red seats outnumbered spectators at a recent Toronto Furies home game. Just 310 people showed up that day at Mastercard Centre, the 1,000-seat practice facility of the N.H.L.’s Toronto Maple Leafs. The turnout was typical for the Furies, one of six clubs in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League.","Sami Jo Small, the Furies’ first-year general manager, often sees larger crowds at her motivational speaking engagements. A three-time Olympian for Canada, she does more than 50 appearances a year across North America for corporate clients.","That’s how Small, 42, makes her living. Running the Furies is largely a volunteer activity, for now.","Through eight seasons as a Furies goaltender, Small saw the difficulties of drawing an audience. She took over the front office in hopes of building something bigger, an enterprise that could pay decent wages to its staff members.","“I wanted people that are willing to put in the time and effort, because they see value in it,” Small said. “Eventually, my hope is that I can pay these people what they’re actually worth. At the moment, we can’t do that. We have to sort of acknowledge that reality right now.”","Small and five other players founded the league in 2007, and she will concede that she expected it to be further along.","Toronto is perhaps the world’s most hockey-crazed city, but not only do the Furies draw a tiny fraction of the Leafs’ audience (about 19,200 fans a game), their attendance also falls well short of the numbers for the city’s minor league men’s team, the Marlies. After winning the American Hockey League’s Calder Cup last season, the Marlies are averaging more than 5,600 fans. The Furies have had several strong seasons, winning the championship as recently as 2014, yet the attendance remains so low that the league often reports it as a zero.","There have been significant advances recently in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League — which has a team in the United States (Worcester, Mass.) and one in China (Shenzhen). Last season, the players started being paid for the first time. Under a league salary cap of 100,000 Canadian dollars, players receive 2,000 to 10,000 Canadian dollars a season.","Also, several prominent members of the rival National Women’s Hockey League, which has five teams in the United States, defected to the Canadian league this season.","With the Furies, Small has noted another improvement, the kind many athletes would not welcome: tough analysis by the news media.","Though drawing attention is a challenge in Canada’s biggest city, where the Leafs are covered obsessively, Small said bloggers had written about women’s hockey regularly — and with an edge.","“When I played for the national team, I always felt like within the media, women’s hockey was treated with kid gloves,” she said. “It was, ‘Oh, it’s so great that you guys are doing this or accomplishing this.’ The only bad media written about women’s hockey was that women shouldn’t play hockey or women’s hockey shouldn’t be at this level.","“There was never media coverage that said: ‘Sami Jo wasn’t at the top of her game. She didn’t play her best tonight.’ We now have people at our practices, knowing the players, knowing what level they should be at.”","The Canadian Women’s Hockey League does not consistently report attendance figures. But the Montreal team, which draws the largest audiences of the four clubs in Canada, attracted 1,567 fans to its home opener on Oct. 13. Last season, when the league added the expansion franchise in China — Kunlun Red Star — to help develop women’s hockey in the country ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, the team averaged 2,000 fans. (When the North American teams travel to China, they stay for a series of games.)","By professional sports standards, Furies tickets are inexpensive. A 14-game season ticket costs 175 Canadian dollars, and regular-season games are 15 Canadian dollars each. By contrast, the average price for a single upper-bowl ticket at Scotiabank Arena for a Leafs regular-season game is 94 Canadian dollars.","The Leafs and the Furies started a partnership in 2012, in which the N.H.L. franchise invests 30,000 Canadian dollars annually in the Furies for equipment, uniforms and travel, and also to offset the costs of coaching. The club also invites the Furies to participate in various Leafs skills development clinics and youth programs, and the partnership expanded in 2015 to include the sale of Furies merchandise at the Leafs’ arena.","Small said that the partnership had also provided superior facilities for the Furies and that she had used them to help recruit players. “We have a great, dedicated dressing room,” she said. “We have a gym right there and a medical facility.”","Small, who played on a men’s hockey team at Stanford while working toward a degree in mechanical engineering, uses her home in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, as her primary office, where she also handles administrative duties for her speaking career.","The Furies play weekend games and practice in Toronto from 9:15 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays — more frequently than any other C.W.H.L. team. It is the only time they can get the ice. Small tries to accommodate her players’ educational, professional and family responsibilities.","Forward Anissa Gamble came to Toronto to pursue a doctorate in diabetes research, and defender Katie Gaskin is a chiropractic student. Defender Shannon Moulson — younger sister of Matt Moulson, a former Islanders forward — is an elementary schoolteacher.","“Shannon Moulson lives in Hillsburgh, so she has a one- hour, 15-minute commute home after practice, and then has to be at school at 8 o’clock in the morning,” Small said. “Do I think she’s exhausted? Yes. She’s constantly on the road.”","To help, Small made Wednesday practice optional. “When I think of Sami Jo, I think of how generous and approachable she is,” said Renata Fast, one of three Furies who played for Canada’s 2018 Olympic silver medalists. “She always makes time for that one-on-one connection.”","To raise money and build fan loyalty, Small offers skills clinics for women in recreational hockey leagues, charging them 50 Canadian dollars apiece to skate with the Furies. A recent event netted the club 900 Canadian dollars.","“I think we have a pretty big impact on them,” Sarah Nurse, another 2018 Olympian, said. “For them to come and tell us their stories about how they started playing hockey at 40, 45 years old and they just love the game, it’s amazing for us.”","Small said these recreational players constituted the majority of Furies fans, attending with their family and friends. She focuses her marketing on them, rather than on young girls working toward playing professionally. According to the Ontario Women’s Hockey Association, the province had 38,914 registered female players at all levels of the sport in 2017-18.","“The reality is that most of the young female players in southern Ontario have tournaments every weekend,” Small said. “Their parents are carting them off from one rink to the next rink. They don’t necessarily have time to come to our games.”","Just two C.W.H.L. regular-season games have been televised across the country this season, and Furies games are not broadcast on radio.","“It would obviously be nice if we had more of our games on TV and even more support from the Leafs and Marlies,” said Natalie Spooner, another of the Furies’ Olympians. “But I do think they try to support us the best they can. Hopefully, eventually we can get to the point where we’re more of a sister team and maybe play back-to-back games or something like that.”"
A Mexican Hockey Player Looks for a Place to Lace Up His Skates - The New York Times,Perhaps the only thing more unusual than being a Mexican in Lithuania is being a Mexican hockey player in Lithuania.,"So the general astonishment that has greeted Hector Majul since his arrival in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, in late November does not surprise him.","At 24, he is a forward for the Hockey Punks, one of four teams in the country’s largely unknown professional league. That move was another unforeseen step on an unconventional hockey path, which shifted when Majul was deported to Mexico during his college career in the United States.","“He is an impressive skater,” said Boris Dorozhenko, Majul’s childhood coach and mentor. “The only problem for him was always his Mexican citizenship.”","Like a growing number of international athletes who want to pursue careers in the United States, Majul found that his immigration status — and what some view as suddenly stringent enforcement of technicalities — had become a major impediment. ","In a country that has long tried to attract athletes and artists with special talents, what once appeared to be a fairly clear path to at least semi-permanent residency has become a far more arduous road. The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.","In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. ","Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.","Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him. Because he was attending high school, Majul entered the United States with a student visa, then became a fixture at hockey clinics in the area, alongside a local standout named Auston Matthews. Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars. ","Majul was allowed to stay in the United States after high school, first on an amateur athlete visa, known as a P1, then on another student visa when he landed at Curry College in Massachusetts to play Division III hockey in 2015. ","By then he was a star for Mexico in international competition. In his first appearance in the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Division II Group B world championship tournament in 2014, he tied for the team’s scoring lead and helped Mexico finish one win shy of promotion to a higher division. He was named the tournament’s top forward in 2015 and again in 2016.","“I know there have been professional players that have Mexican descent or Mexican parents,” Majul said, referring specifically to the N.H.L. (Matthews’s mother is from Mexico.) “But there has never been a Mexican-born pro hockey player. I want to be that guy.”","But on Aug. 22, 2017, as Majul returned to the United States from a trip home to see family, Customs and Border Protection officials at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston discovered a makeup box belonging to his girlfriend, Katy Weizman. An American, Weizman had accompanied Majul on the trip and returned to the United States the previous week. The makeup kit contained a week’s supply of Concerta, her A.D.H.D. medication and a controlled substance.","Majul said that the Houston Police Department had declined to further investigate his possession of the drug, but that he was detained and questioned that night and into the morning. According to an appeal filed by his lawyer, Majul told a customs agent that he had left Mexico “to pursue a career in ice hockey.” ","Based on this admission, Majul was found to have expressed an intention to violate the terms of his student visa. The visa was canceled, and he was deported after almost a decade of legally living and training in the United States. ","When contacted about this case, the Customs and Border Protection agency said in a statement that officers had found that Majul “provided differing answers when asked about his trip to the U.S. and the reason he departed his country of origin.” ","Majul’s lawyer submitted an appeal in September 2017, saying the officers had overreached in their decision. The appeal was denied. ","Marian Daugherty, who took Majul into her home when he first moved to the United States, set up a “Bring Hector Back” Facebook page and reached out to the office of then-Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, to no avail.","Majul was left to train in Mexico City, unable to return to the United States until 2022 and without the services of an agent. But with only 1,552 registered hockey players in Mexico, compared with more than 562,000 in the United States, Majul knew he would need to go elsewhere to keep up his game.","Majul and Dorozhenko canvassed their hockey network. Their search drew the attention of Arno Del Curto, who for 22 years had led the Davos hockey club in Switzerland. Equipped with a 90-day tourist visa, Majul ventured to Switzerland. Within three weeks, he was told that the team wanted him to stay.","“It was a huge relief,” Majul said. “I’m going to be honest, I think I teared up a little bit when I talked to my parents.”","But immigration would again become a hurdle. To qualify for  certification, Majul needed to have been considered a professional before arriving in Switzerland. Because he had most recently played competitive hockey in college and  with the Mexican national team, he was deemed an amateur and denied a visa. The club in Davos appealed to the Swiss government, even offering to hire Majul as a skills coach in the hopes that might provide a legal workaround.","By November, with only five days remaining on his tourist visa and all his options exhausted, Majul went to train with a coach and former colleague of Dorozhenko’s in Serbia. Days later, he received an invitation to join Hockey Punks. ","The Lithuanian club signed Majul to a contract, provided an apartment in Vilnius and helped him stabilize his immigration status. In perhaps the most unexpected turn of this hockey escapade, Majul is not the only Mexican on the team. His countryman Arunas Bermejo joined the club while studying in Lithuania.","“It’s a steppingstone, something to help me get to the next level,” Majul said. “Usually when people say they’re going to Europe, nobody thinks of Lithuania or Vilnius.”","He acknowledged that the transition to life in Vilnius was difficult, especially considering the abrupt nature of his arrival. But he has come to enjoy his new surroundings.","“It’s actually a really nice town,” Majul said. “Great food, people are very friendly. I think the only downside is how cold it is.”","The average high temperature in Vilnius in February is 30 degrees — not frigid, unless your reference points are Mexico and Arizona.","Majul has been approved for worker certification that for the next year or two  will allow him to work within the Schengen Area, a region of 26 European nations, including Switzerland. That would make it easier for Majul to rejoin Davos for the 2019-20 season. (That hope was muddled when Del Curto announced his resignation in November.) ","Daugherty helped Majul enroll in online classes through Arizona State University, and he is working to complete his degree.","In his first professional game, on Dec. 22, a 5-2 loss to Kaunas, Majul registered an assist. In his first eight games with the club, Majul collected a goal and six assists. He has not given up on his pro hockey dreams, including a potential return to the United States.","“I think in North America I have this label of, ‘Why is a Mexican playing hockey? He should be playing soccer,’” Majul said. “Don’t get me wrong. Here it’s also a shock when they hear there’s a Mexican hockey player. But after they see me playing, they see the level that I have, it kind of speaks for itself.”","“I think that was maybe the way it had to go,” he added. “Maybe for me to be able to go on to the next level, I had to come and make it through here first.”"
Building a Women’s Hockey Program One Loss at a Time - The New York Times,"WORCESTER, Mass. — The Holy Cross women’s ice hockey team averaged nearly 20 victories over the last 10 seasons while hanging six conference championship banners at its home rink, the Hart Center.","The senior tri-captains, Tori Messina, Julie Matthias and Sam Girard, helped the team win one of those banners, and the Crusaders posted a 62-17-3 record in their first three seasons.","“We were so used to winning,” Messina, a defender, said.","But this season, the team’s first in Division I, Holy Cross has had to get used to losing.","It is 1-28-3 entering its final game on Friday night, at home against Providence. The other 34 Division I teams have each won at least two games.",The Crusaders have been shut out in 11 games and have been held to one goal in 14 others. They failed to score on their first 43 power-play opportunities after scoring at a 30 percent clip last season.,"“No team I’ve had has ever faced more challenges,” said Peter Van Buskirk, who has coached the program for 19 of its 20 years, taking over in its second season. Before that, he coached the Holy Cross men’s team for 10 seasons between 1979 and 1997, reaching the postseason eight times.","The former athletic director Nate Pine said it had always bothered him that women’s ice hockey was the only sport of the 27 at Holy Cross that was not playing in Division I. And when Holy Cross’s former league, the New England Hockey Conference, decided it wanted only Division III institutions as members, the college began looking for a new hockey home.","Pine, who left Holy Cross in January to become the athletic director at Air Force, approached the Hockey East commissioner, Joe Bertagna, whose league had an uneven number of women’s teams, nine, including top programs like Northeastern, Boston College and Boston University.","Holy Cross, with fewer than 3,000 students, committed to providing additional financial support for the program, and in May 2017 Hockey East announced that the Crusaders would join the league for the 2018-19 season.","“As we continue to make investments over the next four, five years, we expect to be where we want to be,” Pine said in his final week at Holy Cross. “We’re not in this to be an also-ran.”","The news that Holy Cross would join Hockey East came just two months after North Dakota announced that it was dropping its women’s program, along with two other sports, for budgetary reasons. Before Holy Cross, the last new women’s program in Division I was Merrimack College’s, which joined Hockey East for the 2015-16 season.","Last September, L.I.U. Brooklyn said it would have a Division I team beginning in 2019-20, which would bring the number of those programs to 36 nationally. Northern Michigan is also exploring adding a women’s team. (There are 60 Division I men’s hockey teams.)","It is not unusual for a college team to struggle after moving up a division. Bertagna said he thought it was harder for a program to move up a level than to start a team from scratch. Compounding the difficulty for Holy Cross, it began this season with only one class that had been recruited for Division I competition.","Not only were returning Holy Cross players accustomed to winning, so were many of the incoming freshmen. Forward Carlie Magier won state championships for Belle Tire Hockey Club in Detroit, and goalie Jada Brenon won New York State titles while playing for the Nichols School in Buffalo.","“This is a new challenge,” said Magier, who is tied for second on the team with 11 points. “I was looking forward to it. We expected to have bumps in the road.”","One of those bumps came against Connecticut on Oct. 13, when some teammates expressed frustration with one another on the bench as an early lead devolved into a 7-2 loss. It was addressed immediately after the game, and now, Brenon said, “This team gets together better than any team I’ve been on.”","Surprisingly, Holy Cross’s lone victory came Nov. 30 at home against Northeastern, which was ranked No. 5 at the time and is currently No. 3. Down by two goals in the first period, the Crusaders rallied for a 5-3 victory.","Matthias called it “the most fun hockey game I’ve ever played in.” She added, “We finally got what we’d been working for.”","Messina said she was crying on the bench as the game wound down. “I don’t think I breathed the last 10 minutes,” she said, laughing.","Before practice on Jan. 15, Van Buskirk, 76, told his team he would retire after the season. He said that he had begun thinking about retirement last year as he was preparing for his second hip replacement but that he relished the challenge of competing in Hockey East.","“Our record this year doesn’t indicate how successful this journey has been for me and for the team,” he said. “They’ve been very good about focusing on the process, not the outcomes.”","Replacing him will be the associate head coach, Katie Lachapelle, who was hired in July 2017 after nine years as an assistant at Boston University. She has also coached national select teams for U.S.A. Hockey.","“She’s brought a lot of Division I experience, and her exposure to U.S.A. Hockey and anything new coming up has been a big advantage for us,” Van Buskirk said.","The junior forward Rachel Moore, the team’s leading scorer with 14 points, transferred to Holy Cross from Boston College.","Early in the season, she said, the team’s play was “timid, a little cautious, without a lot of confidence.” Now, she added, “we know we can stay with these teams.”","Maine Coach Richard Reichenbach said Holy Cross’s victory over Northeastern had gotten his attention. “You can’t do that on luck,” he said.","But, Messina said, the frustration of this season remains. “I think we all thought we’d pick up another win or two this semester,” she added.","In their first games back from semester break, the Crusaders lost a home-and-home series to Connecticut, 4-3 and 6-3, in which they led twice in the first game and were tied in the second period in the second.","The next Saturday, at home against Maine, they scored twice in the third period for a 2-1 lead, only for Maine to tie the score with an extra attacker with less than a second left. Holy Cross had to settle for an overtime tie.","What this season isn’t providing in victories, it is providing in perspective, as well as an appreciation for the course the team is charting for the future.","“I look at hockey so much different now,” Girard, one of the senior captains, said. “I enjoy the competition every time we play. I wouldn’t trade this for the world.”"
College Hockey’s Depth Is Reflected in Men’s Tournament Field - The New York Times,"For many years, the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s hockey tournament was a celebration of the sport’s aristocracy.","Increasingly, it is becoming a demonstration of the sport’s parity.","Of the 16 teams in this year’s tournament, which begins Friday, only six have won a national championship.","Arizona State, in only its third season playing a full Division I schedule, is the first independent to make the tournament in 27 years. Another first-time participant is American International College, a school of less than 2,000 undergraduates in Springfield, Mass.",Bowling Green State is in the tournament for the first time since 1990; the University of Massachusetts for the first time since 2007.,"The fresh faces have come at the expense of college hockey’s traditional powers. For the first time since 1970, Boston College, Boston University, Michigan, Minnesota and North Dakota all missed the tournament. Combined, they have won 32 national titles.",A variety of factors have contributed to the flattening of the pyramid atop college hockey.,"N.H.L. expansion and the growth of youth hockey in places like Illinois, St. Louis and the Sun Belt over the past couple of decades have deepened the player pool. Top-level recruits have more attractive destinations to choose from with the rise of programs like Penn State, Arizona State and Minnesota Duluth, which has won two titles since 2011 and is the top seed in this year’s Midwest Regional.","Two of the top six overall seeds in this year’s tournament — No. 2 Minnesota State and No. 6 Quinnipiac — were Division II programs in the 1990s. Over the last seven seasons, though, they have the most wins in college hockey.","Minnesota State has yet to win a N.C.A.A. tournament game in Division I, but Quinnipiac has reached two Frozen Fours and lost in the championship game to Yale in 2013.","Quinnipiac Coach Rand Pecknold, who earlier this year won his 500th game at the school, attributed the success of programs like his to focusing on recruiting “the right type of player.”","“We’re winning with a lot of kids nobody wanted,” he said. “They’re our bread and butter.”",He added: “Success depends on more than just having talent. You need an identity and a culture.”,"A.I.C. Coach Eric Lang won only eight games in his first season, 2016-17. But last season the Yellow Jackets won a postseason series for the first time, and in 2018-19 they had the best regular-season record in Atlantic Hockey and won the conference tournament.","“Every team has to find their competitive advantage,” said Lang, whose team faces top-seeded St. Cloud State on Friday. “For us, it was going over to Europe to recruit. We’re probably 60th among the 60 Division I teams in terms of resources, so we have to turn over every rock here.”","A.I.C.’s roster features 11 players from seven European countries, including Norway, Slovenia and Ukraine.","While the most prominent programs continue to get more than their share of top N.H.L. draft picks and players from USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program, many of these players leave college after one or two years.","At rising programs, the rosters are stocked with players from the amateur United States Hockey League or the top Canadian junior leagues. These players not only typically stay in college for at least three years, but they also start their college careers at an older age. It’s not unusual for 17- and 18-year-olds to be playing against skaters six and seven years older.","The teams with older players have more continuity from year to year, as well as more critical experience in postseason play. Four teams in the tournament — Minnesota State, Arizona State, A.I.C. and Ohio State — have an average age over 21.","“There’s a ton of really good players out there, and there aren’t enough stalls with only 60 teams,” said Arizona State Coach Greg Powers, whose team plays Quinnipiac on Saturday. “And when you get older players, they’re ready-made for college hockey from the physicality standpoint.”",Michigan Coach Mel Pearson led the Wolverines to the Frozen Four in 2018 but finished 13-16-7 this season.,"Referring to the changing dynamics in college hockey, particularly the balance between recruiting players the N.H.L. covets and building an experienced roster, Pearson admitted: “I don’t think we’ve adapted yet. We’re still trying to figure it out.”","“In basketball, you can win with three players,” he added. “In hockey, you need nine or 10 pretty good players for a chance to compete.”","Perhaps the team with the most daunting route to the tournament was Arizona State. With no conference affiliation, the team regularly traveled far for games, and most of its home games were played at a community ice rink with less than 1,000 seats.","The Sun Devils won only 23 games the last three years. This season they finished 21-12-1, despite road trips to Penn State, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Boston University, Rochester Institute of Technology and Minnesota.","Eight months after winning the national club hockey title in March 2014, Arizona State announced it would play as a Division I program for the 2015-16 season.","“We just jumped into it and had to figure things out along the way,” said Powers, who coached the club program after playing goalie for it in college. “We learned that it’s O.K. if you don’t have the answers right away.”","The players from his first recruiting class are seniors this season. Powers said he expected to be playing in a new on-campus facility sometime during the 2020-21 season, an indication of the university’s commitment to hockey.","“It comes down to having the right people passionate about getting it done,” he said. “If you have the right people in place, you’re going to have success.”","Boston College won the last of its five N.C.A.A. titles under Jerry York in 2012 and has reached the Frozen Four twice since, but the Eagles have missed the tournament three years in a row.","“Everybody’s putting a lot of resources into their programs now,” York said. “I think it’s great for college hockey. We’ve got to keep growing our sport.”"
A Women’s Hockey Star Emerges Again at Home in Minnesota - The New York Times,"MINNEAPOLIS — The Minnesota Whitecaps, the newest and possibly best team in the National Women’s Hockey League, occasionally practice in an arena that is the closest thing to a women’s hockey museum in this hockey-loving state.","Ridder Arena, home of the University of Minnesota women’s team, features sprawling murals high at each end, honoring the program’s Olympians and All-Americans. The Whitecaps stars Lee Stecklein and Hannah Brandt, gold medalists for the 2018 United States Olympic team, appear on both. And the All-American mural includes one of the Whitecaps co-coaches, Ronda Curtin Engelhardt.","All were on the ice for a recent practice, with Engelhardt, 32, even joining her players for postgame sprints. But nothing in the arena acknowledges the Whitecaps’ leading scorer, Jonna Curtis, a left wing who was never a Golden Gopher, an Olympian or an All-American.","That the unheralded Curtis, 25, leads in the Whitecaps in goals (eight), assists (11) and points (19), rather than one of the team’s three Olympic gold medalists — wing Kendall Coyne Schofield is the third — illustrates the deep statewide talent pool. Minnesota was the first state to sanction girls high school hockey, in 1994. According to USA Hockey, more girls and women play hockey in Minnesota than any other state: close to 14,000 in 2017-18, the most recent season available.","“I’m happy to be here on a team with most of the girls I grew up playing with,” Curtis said.","Last weekend, the Whitecaps, with 13 Minnesotans among 17 players in uniform, secured the N.W.H.L.’s regular-season championship with back-to-back victories at the Boston Pride and the Connecticut Whale. That also earned Minnesota (12-4-0, 24 points) the No. 1 seed and home ice throughout in the Isobel Cup playoffs.","Against Boston, the speedy Curtis scored the winning goal with 1 minute 42 seconds to play, crashing the net from the left and putting in a rebound for a 2-1 victory. Curtis finished tied for second in the league in points, one behind Hayley Scamurra of the Buffalo Beauts. Leaguewide, she outscored all seven forwards in the league who skated for the American team at the Pyeongchang Olympics.","“It just shows how consistent she’s been all year,” Brandt said. “She started the year pretty strong and she hasn’t really let up, whereas the rest of us have kind of gone up and down a little.”","In a single-elimination semifinal on Sunday, the Whitecaps will face the Metropolitan Riveters. The league championship game is the next weekend.","No matter what happens, the Whitecaps, a semiprofessional team founded in 2004, made their N.W.H.L. debut season an unqualified success. The league’s first expansion team and its first franchise outside the northeastern United States, the Whitecaps sold out all eight home games at Tria Rink, the practice facility for the N.H.L.’s Minnesota Wild, which has a capacity of 1,200. League officials say the Whitecaps are the first team in its four seasons to turn a profit. Sunday’s game is also a sellout.","In the small circle of Twin Cities women’s hockey, Curtis is a familiar name. A two-time Minnesota Ms. Hockey finalist in high school — she, Stecklein and Brandt were up for the award in 2012, with Brandt winning — Curtis holds Elk River High career records with 280 points and 124 assists. All three attended summer youth hockey camps run by Winny Brodt Brown, the Whitecaps’ captain. Engelhardt was among the instructors.","“We knew each other pretty well,” Stecklein said. “I remember hearing about this girl who was really good, had really good hands and had a toe pull that beat just about every team.”","A toe pull is a stickhandling move, also known as a toe drag, where the puck carrier pulls the puck toward them with the toe of the blade to avoid a defender. In preteen hockey, only the most advanced players master it.","Curtis planned on attending college in Minnesota until Brown, her idol and mentor, suggested she check out New Hampshire while in that area for a tournament.","“I went and visited, fell in love with the people and the campus, and never looked back,” Curtis said.","She broke her collarbone three times, which limited her to 15 games in her first two seasons. But she gained a year back through a medical redshirt and led New Hampshire in points her final three seasons without missing a game. Her 21 goals as a senior earned her first-team all-Hockey East.","But the Wildcats never posted a winning record during her time, and USA Hockey never chose her for an age-group national team or international competition. Graduating in 2017 with a bioengineering degree, Curtis returned to Minnesota to work for a pharmaceutical company.","She signed up to play for a team called Minnesota Shenanigans in the Women’s Hockey Association of Minnesota, a popular Twin Cities recreational league. Long hours and weekend shifts at work limited her appearances, she said.","“I wanted to start a career and wasn’t thinking too much about hockey,” she said. “But that year I wasn’t playing, I missed it. Hearing the Minnesota Whitecaps were going to be a thing, I got excited. I had to try out.”","Past connections helped. The Whitecaps founder Jack Brodt, Brown’s father, was a Whitecaps’ co-coach and the general manager. Engelhardt left her coaching job at The Breck School in suburban Minneapolis to join Brodt, a neighbor from Roseville, Minn., on the bench.","No one had forgotten the fast-skating girl with the soft hands. “She was always in our loop,” Engelhardt said.","Teamed with center Katie McGovern from Minnesota Duluth and right wing Kate Schipper from Minnesota on the team’s No. 2 line, Curtis had at least one point in each game of Minnesota’s season-opening five-game winning streak. Her best performance came Jan. 20 against Connecticut, with one goal and three assists in a 9-0 rout.","Coyne Schofield, who participated in the N.H.L.’s faster skater competition during All-Star weekend in January, is unquestionably the fleetest Whitecap. But the 5-foot-4 Curtis is not far behind, Brandt said.","Stecklein remembered an early-season race-to-the-puck drill between Curtis and Allie Thunstrom, a three-time Hockey East selection from Boston College and a former speedskater, being neck-and-neck.","“We have the fastest team, and she’s right up there,” Stecklein said. “She’s shifty. She’s tricky. Doing one-on-ones, she can go in either direction very quickly. And her hands are so smooth that they don’t give anything away.”","A job change allowed Curtis a more flexible schedule to fit in weekend games and most practices. Curtis shares an apartment with her Whitecaps teammates Margo Lund and Sadie Lundquist. Skating on a winning team with three Olympians and so many faces from her Minnesota hockey upbringing thrills Curtis, who thought her best hockey memories were behind her.","“I’m happy to just be playing again,” she said. “I always dreamed of being in the Olympics, because that was the only thing you could do after college when I was young. Now little girls can dream of being a professional hockey player. It’s great to start that out.”"

"Move Over, Gophers: Balance of Power Shifts in Minnesota Hockey - The New York Times","ST. CLOUD, Minn. — John Mariucci and Herb Brooks, considered the godfathers of modern college hockey in Minnesota, never could have envisioned this in their lifetimes. But when Coach Bob Motzko left St. Cloud State after last season to succeed the retiring Don Lucia at the University of Minnesota, he arguably made a lateral move, not a step up.","Such a notion would have been hockey heresy in the 1950s and ’60s, when Mariucci coached the Golden Gophers to national prominence, or the 1970s, when Brooks led Minnesota to three N.C.A.A. titles before coaching the 1980 United States Olympic team to the Miracle on Ice.","The Gophers used to be the premier program in the state, but that has changed.","Last season St. Cloud State, Minnesota Duluth and Minnesota State qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament, with St. Cloud claiming the overall No. 1 seed and Minnesota Duluth winning its second national title this decade. Minnesota, a five-time national champion, missed the 16-team tournament for the second time in three seasons.","And the balance of power continues to shift. St. Cloud State (27-4-3) remained atop both national polls this week, with Minnesota Duluth (21-11-2) fourth. Minnesota State (29-7-2) is second in one poll and third in the other. As the teams begin their conference tournaments this weekend, St. Cloud, Minnesota State and Minnesota Duluth are all in line for No. 1 seeds in the N.C.A.A. tournament.","Motzko’s Gophers had their moments, sweeping two-game series against highly ranked programs in Ohio State and Arizona State in recent weeks. But their 18-15-4 overall mark leaves them unranked and tied for 20th in the PairWise, a formula used by the N.C.A.A. Selection Committee to fill the tournament field. Minnesota may need to win the Big Ten tournament for an automatic bid this weekend to avoid another N.C.A.A. miss.","“We’re at the beginning stages of putting our footprint down,” Motzko said. “I know I’m taking over one of the most storied programs in the history of college hockey. There’s nothing holding us back except for ourselves.”","The change in Minnesota reflects a nationwide trend of newer programs usurping traditional powers. Of the seven teams with five or more N.C.A.A. titles, only Denver and North Dakota are ranked. Conspicuously absent: The Gophers, Michigan, Boston College, Boston University and Wisconsin.","What happened? More schools are benefiting from an expanded pool of players, coming from Europe and nontraditional American markets like California and Florida. And recruits have discovered more paths to the Frozen Four and the N.H.L.","Over the last eight years, Minnesota Duluth, Union, Providence and Yale won their first national championships. Since 2009, the five Minnesota Division I programs (Bemidji State rounds them out) combined for seven Frozen Four appearances. Only Minnesota State failed to make it, even as a No. 1 seed in 2015.","A decade ago, most recruits in the region considered the Gophers their best route to pro hockey. That is no longer the case. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that two members of Bemidji State’s 2009 Frozen Four team, Matt Read and Brad Hunt, play for the Minnesota Wild.","“In the day, Minnesota used to take whoever they wanted,” said Brett Larson, the former Minnesota Duluth assistant coach who succeeded Motzko as coach of the St. Cloud Huskies. “Now these kids know there are four other great options out there, and they can find the one that fits them — not just as a hockey player, but as a person too.”","St. Cloud, Minnesota Duluth, Bemidji State and Minnesota State share much in common. All play in relatively new or renovated facilities. St. Cloud renamed its arena for Brooks in 2013 after $13 million in upgrades brought it in line with similar arenas around the state.","It was Brooks, between N.H.L. coaching jobs, who stepped in as the Huskies’ head coach for one season, 1986-87, guiding the transition from Division III to Division I. A young Motzko, a former St. Cloud player, took his first coaching job as one of Brooks’s assistants. Brooks helped the university secure arena funding before leaving to coach the Minnesota North Stars.","“Herb Brooks’s vision of getting St. Cloud State to the Division I level was to create more opportunities for kids in the state to be able to play at that level,” said Larson, who grew up in Duluth. “That was the turning point. For Minnesota, and for the rest of us, it’s created a very competitive environment in the state.”","Motzko returned to St. Cloud as head coach in 2005 after four seasons as an assistant at Minnesota, a stretch during which the Gophers won their last two N.C.A.A. titles. The Huskies made eight N.C.A.A. tournament appearances in Motzko’s 13 seasons.","Reaching the Frozen Four in 2013, and joining the new National Collegiate Hockey Conference the following season, raised St. Cloud’s national profile. Their leading scorers, Patrick Newell and Robby Jackson, came from California.","“When my dad first told me that St. Cloud State was interested, I didn’t even know who they were, to be completely honest,” Jackson said. “All I knew was the Gophers.”","He neglected to wear a winter coat on his recruiting visit to campus, a sartorial snafu the assistant coach Mike Gibbons still razzes him about.","Now in his 19th season at Minnesota Duluth, Scott Sandelin has sent 21 players to the N.H.L. His .739 winning percentage in N.C.A.A. tournament play (17-6) leads active coaches and ranks fourth on the career list.","“When I first came in, Minnesota had always been strong,” Sandelin said in a telephone interview from Duluth. “It seemed like we were always behind them. That was good motivation to work hard and try to build your program to compete with them, try to get some of the kids they always seemed to get.”","Sandelin prefers players from the United States Hockey League or Canada’s top junior leagues who might stay four years. So does Minnesota State Coach Mike Hastings. And like Motzko, Hastings expanded his recruiting beyond Minnesota. The Mavericks feature three players from Germany, and next season two are coming from Florida. (Another recruit has a familiar name: Sandelin’s son, Ryan, a forward.)","In Motzko’s mind, the Gophers started slipping a decade ago when too many players began leaving early for the N.H.L. Minnesota traditionally signs more N.H.L. draftees than its in-state rivals. This year’s roster features 13, nine more than St. Cloud’s.","Huskies captain Jimmy Schuldt, a senior defenseman, turned down N.H.L. free-agent offers last summer for one more crack at leading St. Cloud to its first N.C.A.A. title.","Speed, depth and four-year loyalty were hallmarks of Motzko’s teams at St. Cloud. He said believes that formula can work at Minnesota.","“I’ve got great confidence we’re going in a great direction,” he said. “I’d like to get there quick.”"
"Hefty Raises, Olympic Gold, and Then Crumbs for U.S. Women’s Hockey - The New York Times","In many ways, there has never been a better time to be a member of the United States women’s national hockey team.","Two years after the players threatened to boycott the world championship tournament over pay equity, U.S.A. Hockey, the national governing body, is paying them more than ever, about $71,000 each annually.","On the ice, the American women have continued to exceed the achievements of the men’s national team and won their second Olympic gold medal in a stirring final against Canada.",Members of the team have skated in the skills competition at N.H.L. All-Star weekend and served as analysts for N.H.L. television broadcasts. Participation in the sport among girls and women is skyrocketing.,"But halfway through the labor contract with U.S.A. Hockey signed in March 2017, as the national team begins its pursuit of a fifth straight world championship in Finland this week, its players wonder whether the future of their sport is as bright as the present. Those concerns grew after the Canadian Women’s Hockey League, one of two professional leagues in North America, announced Sunday it would fold in May.","Although the American players negotiated gains in salary and travel and medical benefits two years ago, the “groundbreaking support” for girls and women’s hockey promised by U.S.A. Hockey in the contract has been slow to develop. The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group created in the deal has been largely invisible. Minimal promotion for the team and a lack of organizational diversity in U.S.A. Hockey also raise concerns from players and female alumni that little has changed.","“People are drooling for women’s hockey,” forward Kendall Coyne Schofield said in an interview late last year. “But the product we deliver isn’t being shown. There’s been a lot of lost opportunities, a lot of opportunities that haven’t been capitalized on.”","Those opportunities included high-profile media appearances before the Olympics like a national magazine feature, a major network documentary series and other live television offers, which U.S.A. Hockey declined, according to three people with direct knowledge of those projects. After the Olympics, some players were unaware that they were eligible for four-figure bonuses offered by Hershey’s for winning the gold medal.","U.S.A. Hockey’s executive director, Pat Kelleher, was not made available for an interview to discuss the women’s national team.","After the Olympics, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, but players were frustrated that there were no plans for a post-Olympic exhibition tour. In an interview late last year, forward Hilary Knight lamented that the team disappeared when its popularity was at its highest.","Because of the talent disparity between North American teams and the rest of the world, there are not many viable opponents for the Americans, and Canada’s cooperation is necessary. Last month, the two nations finally staged a three-game exhibition series, with one game in the United States. An announced crowd of 9,048 fans attended the game in Detroit, which was also broadcast live on NHL Network.","But other avenues to increase exposure do not need Canadian co-signs, like merchandising. Nike, the official apparel supplier of U.S.A. Hockey and a company that champions equality in advertisements, does not sell jerseys of American women’s players or products specifically featuring female players. Neither does U.S.A. Hockey’s online store.","Coyne Schofield, one of the players who has been featured by the N.H.L. since the Olympics, is inundated with inquiries from parents about where they can buy apparel with her name. She has memorized a response with detailed instructions on how to purchase customized men’s items, even down to the six-week shipping time frame. That’s how Knight obtained replicas of her jersey for her family.","“That alone is so degrading,” Coyne Schofield said. “There’s no reason why anybody shouldn’t be able to go on usahockey.com and buy a Hilary Knight jersey, my jersey. Right now, women’s hockey is not accessible to consumers. It needs to be accessible in every fashion.”","Nike, which recently unveiled soccer kits for the 2019 Women’s World Cup that for the first time were specifically designed for women’s teams, did not respond to requests to discuss its women’s hockey apparel.","As with the jerseys, the American players handle much of their promotion themselves. Despite repeated requests from athletes, U.S.A. Hockey has not created social medial channels dedicated solely to the women’s team, as U.S. Soccer has. Olympians like Coyne Schofield and Monique Lamoureux-Morando worked as analysts on NHL Network and NBCSN. The players have lobbied the N.H.L. for more support for women’s hockey, particularly for its professionals, whose salaries range from $2,000 to $10,000.","The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group was supposed to be a conduit of influence for the players. Over the past two years, U.S.A. Hockey declined repeated requests to discuss the group.","The New York Times confirmed the participation of at least five women in the group, including hockey executives and members of the 2018 Olympic team. Multiple people with knowledge of meetings said the group was stagnant in its first year and only recently began having meaningful conversations. One player said she was unsure if she was allowed to talk about the group.","In March, the N.H.L. and the N.H.L. Players’ Association announced the formation of their own Female Hockey Advisory Committee with the goal “to accelerate the growth” of hockey for girls and women in North America, and named 11 members, all women. They include Michele Amidon, a former director for women’s hockey at U.S.A. Hockey, and several former members of the U.S. national women’s team.",But women’s representation remains lacking in U.S.A. Hockey’s leadership.,"Of all American Winter Olympic governing sports bodies, U.S.A. Hockey has the lowest percentage of women on its board of directors (17.58 percent) and is the worst at reaching its benchmark for female hires, according to the most recent data available from the United States Olympic Committee.","There are full-fledged councils within U.S.A. Hockey devoted to youth, adult and junior hockey, but none specifically for girls and women. Decisions related to girls’ and women’s hockey are administered by the youth council, which is led by a man and where only four of the 25 members are women. There are also no women on the organization’s marketing council.","Proponents for U.S. women’s hockey have long struggled to have their voices heard. Lynn Olson became the first woman hired to work for U.S.A. Hockey’s girls and women’s section back in 1988, but it served only as an advisory panel to the board of directors.","During her tenure, which ended in 2013, Olson described U.S.A. Hockey as being run like a “good old boys club.” She was sometimes denied funds to hold meetings for her panel, so she put up her own money. Olson also said she tried to make the section a full-fledged council, which would provide more influence, writing up legislation that never passed.","Olson noted that more women wanted to be involved in U.S.A. Hockey, but had a hard time getting elected to positions of power. “You need to change the minds of males in the room,” she said.","Veteran leaders of the hockey team expressed faith that the culture could change under Kelleher, who was named U.S.A. Hockey’s executive director in April 2017. In recent months, he met with players in Maine, Chicago and Michigan.","“We hadn’t had that in the past,” Coyne Schofield said. “For me, it was a huge first impression.”","The United States national women’s soccer team, an inspiration for the hockey team in its fight for equality, was so frustrated with the lack of progress on a number of issues that the players recently filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against its governing body, U.S. Soccer.",Knight said she did not yet foresee a repeat of the fraught 2017 negotiations that led to the boycott threat and a fracture between U.S.A. Hockey and the women’s team that is still being repaired.,"U.S.A. Hockey seems to be aware of the need for more gender balance. Don Gould, chairman of the girls and women’s section, said at the federation’s annual meeting that the organizational culture must evolve to advance opportunities for girls and women, socially and in sport.","“This objective cannot be realized without first creating an environment that values them equally at every level,” Gould said. “Whether we work on the bench or in the boardroom, this is our first obligation.”",But nine of 10 members of U.S.A. Hockey’s committee that nominates candidates to become officers of the organization are men.,"“There are great people at the top that care about women’s hockey, but you absolutely don’t have the numbers to have a real change,” said Angela Ruggiero, one of the most accomplished American hockey players and a former member of the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission. “We have an extremely long way to go.”"

Truck Driver in Crash That Devastated a Hockey Team Is Sentenced to 8 Years - The New York Times,"OTTAWA — A truck driver whose inattention led to the deaths of 16 people aboard a youth hockey team bus in Saskatchewan last year, a collision that shook Canada, was sentenced to eight years in prison on Friday.","The defendant, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, had driven a tractor-trailer laden with peat moss at about 60 miles an hour past five signs warning him to stop before the truck collided with a bus carrying the team, the Humboldt Broncos. Thirteen other people were injured last April in the crash, which occurred with such force that the bus flipped on its side and the two vehicles slid well off the highway before coming to a stop in a pile of rubble.","Many of the victims were young players who had come from across Western Canada to live with families in Humboldt, a farm town of about 6,000. They had joined the Broncos with hopes of either advancing to professional careers or getting college scholarships.","Canadians mourned the loss of so many young lives, which prompted an outpouring of donations from across the country for the survivors and families of the dead. Informal memorials, like symbolic hockey sticks left in front of homes, quickly appeared.",Mr. Sidhu had earlier pleaded guilty to 29 counts of dangerous driving.,"“Families have been torn apart because of the loss,” Judge Inez Cardinal said at the hearing in Melfort, Saskatchewan, after reviewing more than 100 statements from victims. “Somehow we must stop this carnage on our highways.”","Mr. Sidhu, who worked for a tiny trucking company in Alberta, was on his first solo trip about two weeks after qualifying as a truck driver.","There was no sign that he was impaired by drugs or alcohol on the night of crash, nor was he using his phone as he sped past the corner’s oversize stop sign and its flashing warning light. Nothing on the corner obstructed his view of the approaching bus, nor did he notice that an oncoming car had stopped for it.",The judge said that Mr. Sidhu appeared to have been distracted by a flapping tarp on one of the trailers.,"“This was not a momentary loss of attention,” Judge Cardinal said. “He had ample time to stop his unit.”","She added, “Seconds matter, attention to the road matters.”","At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said that investigators had concluded that it was impossible for the driver of the team bus, who was among the victims, to have avoided slamming into Mr. Sidhu’s truck.","The sentence was less than the 10 years that prosecutors had sought, but longer than most dangerous-driving sentences in Canada. Mr. Sidhu, who is 30 and lives in Calgary, Alberta, will probably be deported to India after his release from prison.","“The sentence is subject to varying opinions, but what is important is that Mr. Sidhu pleaded guilty, has shown remorse and has remained accountable for his careless actions,” Jamie Brockman, the president of the Broncos, said in a statement.","Since the collision, Saskatchewan and Alberta have introduced mandatory and more rigorous classroom and on-road training for heavy-truck drivers. They have also beefed up licensing tests."
"In Canada, a Hockey Revival - The New York Times","PETERBOROUGH, Ontario — The Rev. John Perdue is only 33, so he does not remember much from the heyday of the Flying Fathers, a troupe of hockey-playing Catholic priests who played comedy-filled charity games beginning in 1964.","The Flying Fathers were the Harlem Globetrotters of hockey — touring North America and Europe, compiling more than 900 wins and only a handful of losses, and raising an estimated $4 million. They assessed penalties for skipping Mass on Sunday or “acting like a Protestant.” They brought out a horse, Penance, who was outfitted in goalie pads and trained to kneel reverently.","Sister Mary Shooter would put on a display of skating and puck handling, then throw off her habit to reveal her true identity: the Rev. Les Costello, who won a Stanley Cup with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1948 at age 20 before retiring two years later to enter the priesthood.","By the early 1980s, Hollywood even took notice and tried to make a movie about the Flying Fathers for which Wayne Gretzky auditioned.","After the team’s 25th anniversary, in 1989, a number of Fathers retired and, although the team played until 2009, its aura dimmed.","Now Father Perdue, the vocations director for the Peterborough diocese and a former two-time junior hockey champion, is trying to bring it back. ","“When I was a young boy, they were very big,” he said. “Everybody in the Catholic world knew about the Flying Fathers.”","He has organized a new team of Flying Fathers and a tour, with three benefit games this week in Ontario and Quebec. If successful, this tour could be the start of something bigger.","That is a tall order. Priests do not enjoy the same popularity they did when the original Flying Fathers played, in large part because of sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church. Spectators may not be receptive to priests doing comedy routines. ",The new Flying Fathers know they can’t escape the shadow. ,"“The church needs a good news story,” Father Perdue said. “There are many reasons why this is a beautiful thing to do.”","The Rev. Kris Schmidt, 32, from Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, said, “The church, now more than ever, needs to see priests as human, and I think it’s a great way that this bridge can be formed.”",Some are not so sure the Flying Fathers can be relevant again.,"“I think the glory days are over, but they may as well try,” said the Rev. Pat Blake, 84, the longest-serving member of the original team, who played for more than 40 years.","Father Perdue said encouraging more men to enter the priesthood was part of his motivation for reviving the Flying Fathers. When the number of seminarians declined in the original team’s waning years, it recruited police officers and firefighters to fill out the roster. ","Talent-wise, no one on the new team is like Father Costello, who played 21 N.H.L. games. He died in 2002, several days after hitting his head on the ice during a Flying Fathers game. ","The current players, who range in age from their 20s to their 50s, expect to be as skilled as a good high school team. Some grew up playing competitive junior hockey, and the Rev. John MacPherson, 55, reached the varsity level at Acadia University in Nova Scotia. Another, the Rev. Tavis Goski, 29, spent summers as a skating instructor. Many of the priests have stayed sharp by playing in weekly pickup games.","The priests have been recruited from across the country; with everyone so spread out, they have not practiced together.","Father MacPherson, from Kentville, Nova Scotia, who played with the Flying Fathers from 1988 to 2008, said that missing practice was never a problem.","“They practiced once back in the 1970s and lost the next game,” he said. “So they said, ‘The heck with that, we’re not doing that again.’ They just trust in their coach: God.”","In the days leading up to the tour, Father Perdue mapped out a script. Sister Mary Shooter, also known as the Flying Nun, makes a cameo in her flowing habit and scores on a penalty shot. She is played with gusto by a real-life nun: Sister Mary Catherine Perdue, who is Father Perdue’s sister. The tour has also introduced a Flying Monk, played by Father Perdue. ","The Flying Fathers are not straying from the original script — “an unusual mix of religion, hockey and comedy,” said the Rev. Tim Shea, 70, who played his first game in 1969.","According to a new book, “Holy Hockey: The Story of Canada’s Flying Fathers,” by Frank Cosentino, church leaders did not support the idea of the team in the early 1960s, believing that such showmanship was unbecoming of a priest. Eventually, Bishop Alexander Carter of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, was won over.","The original Flying Fathers were founded by the Rev. Brian McKee and played their first benefit game on Feb. 20, 1964, beating a team from North Bay, Ontario, radio and television stations, 13-4, in front of a crowd of 3,126.","The Flying Fathers won the rematch in 1965, 16-6, and the official paid attendance was 5,030, the largest crowd for a hockey game in North Bay to that date, according to Cosentino’s book.","The Flying Fathers began traveling across Canada, the United States and Europe, playing 25 to 30 games a season. By the early 1980s, “Real People” broadcast the story of priests playing hockey on American television.","Cosentino wrote that several movie studios, including Francis Ford Coppola’s Zoetrope Studios, had showed interest in turning the story into a film. Gretzky auditioned, but his screen test did not go well, and ultimately a conflict over the priests’ portrayal doomed the project.","The team’s second act has been years in the making. Father Perdue began organizing a game between seminarians and a group of hockey players in the Peterborough area, northeast of Toronto. By the winter of 2017, that game had become the Father Costello Classic, named after the Flying Fathers’ star.",A member of the organizing committee for the classic suggested that priests should play in the game instead of seminarians.,"“Oh, boy, are we really going to do this?” Father Perdue remembered thinking at the time. “There was this giant legacy that we would be stepping into. I said, ‘Guys, if we’re going to have a team of hockey-playing priests, you can’t do this and not invoke the legacy of the Flying Fathers.’”","Father Perdue called Frank Quinn, a retired police officer and former general manager of the original team.","With the organizing committee meeting in progress, Quinn, 75, came bursting through the door wearing a Flying Fathers jersey, a Flying Fathers jacket and a Flying Fathers hat.","Quinn got approval from former players and managers to use the name Flying Fathers, and the first test case was a benefit game in Ennismore, Ontario, in January 2018.","The Flying Fathers won, beating a local high school team, 13-6, but six of those goals came on a “touchdown” after a football made its way into the net.","The 650-seat arena in Ennismore was full. Among the crowd was the Rev. Vaughan Quinn, 85, a former Flying Fathers goalie but no relation to Frank, wearing an original team jacket. In his day, he would lie on top of the goal performing a juggling routine while play was in the other end.","“He literally had tears in his eyes,” said Barrie Schultz, 48, who has taken over as general manager of the Flying Fathers, “because he couldn’t believe this was happening again.”"
N.W.H.L. Moves to Unify Pro Women’s Hockey as Its Rival Fades Away - The New York Times,"Since Sunday, when the Canadian Women’s Hockey League  announced it will cease operations, many have pondered how to elevate women’s professional hockey.","Some answers came on Tuesday, as the N.H.L. became one of the largest financial backers of the National Women’s Hockey League — the only remaining pro option for women in the United States and Canada — according to both leagues. And the N.W.H.L. announced it would expand into Canada.","Neither Dani Rylan, commissioner and founder of the N.W.H.L., nor a spokesperson for the N.H.L. would disclose the length and terms of the deal. The N.H.L. noted that it previously sponsored both women’s leagues, and has now increased its contribution to the N.W.H.L.",A sturdy future partnership between the N.H.L. and N.W.H.L. could dramatically increase exposure for women’s hockey. But former C.W.H.L. players and members of the Canadian and U.S. national teams are waiting to see if the N.W.H.L. remains the best option this fall or if another opportunity materializes.,"To boost its appeal, the N.W.H.L., which launched in 2015, also announced Tuesday its intention to add teams next season in Montreal and Toronto. Those two cities formerly hosted C.W.H.L. franchises. The measure, which was approved by the N.W.H.L. board, would increase the N.W.H.L.’s reach to seven clubs across North America.",Rylan said that it is “incredibly important” for the N.W.H.L. to include stars from the C.W.H.L. teams in Montreal and Toronto — like Olympians Marie-Philip Poulin and Hilary Knight.,"“We want to put the best product on the ice,” said Rylan, who met with N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman Monday. “We knew it was so important to have a presence there so those top players have a place to play this fall.”","Knight, a star forward last season on Les Canadiennes de Montréal of the C.W.H.L. (and who left the N.W.H.L. after the 2016-17 season), declined to comment on Tuesday’s news, as she prepared to defend a world championship with the U.S. women’s national team in Finland this week.","Rylan acknowledged logistics like travel to Canada must still be figured out. The N.W.H.L. also is looking at increasing its schedule to 24 games, up from 17 this past season.","Until those issues and others are sorted out, Liz Knox, co-chair of the C.W.H.L. Players’ Association, said her constituents are willing to stay in a holding pattern, even if that means not playing come October.","“It seems like a strategic move for the N.W.H.L.,” Knox said. “It seems a little kneejerk to me because our league just folded two days ago. We’re dealing with a very heavy loss. If you lose a family pet you’ve had for 12 years, you don’t go out and buy a new pet two days later.”","Knox has been in contact with Anya Battaglino, director of the N.W.H.L. Players’ Association, to discuss the best steps for women’s hockey. Soon after the U.S. women’s team landed in Finland on Monday, it held a meeting with players from the Canadian national team. Since the two countries met in the 2018 Olympic final, both sides noted the need to work together to advance their sport.","“There will have to be changes in the N.W.H.L. model to make our players happy,” Knox said, referring to athletes from both leagues. In Nov. 2016, the N.W.H.L. drastically slashed salaries.","As of now, the N.H.L.’s involvement won’t resemble the N.B.A.’s backing of the W.N.B.A.: it does not include ice time, or major assistance in marketing, promotion or other business-related aid that would help the N.W.H.L.","The N.W.H.L.’s major sponsor over its first four years of existence was Dunkin’ Donuts. That deal recently ended, but Rylan said the two sides are in the process of renewal and that she expects their partnership to continue.","The N.H.L.’s cachet, of course, could open much bigger doors than the coffee and doughnut chain, including a larger network of international business partners, as well as possible new avenues for broadcasting and streaming options. More revenue from those outlets could also lead to an increase in N.W.H.L. salaries, which last season ranged from $3,000 to $10,000.","Battaglino, who said she was extremely proud of the N.W.H.L.’s growth, prioritized better pay as an issue the league should address as it now prepares to extend its reach farther than any women’s pro hockey league before, with a co-sign from the largest hockey influencer in the world.","“Women’s hockey players deserve a livable wage,” Battaglino said. “Women’s hockey players deserve the respect to be able to say, I am a professional athlete, proudly. Currently our athletes say, ‘I am a blank and on the nights and weekends I get to play professional hockey.’”"
Wisconsin’s Annie Pankowski Tries to Leave College Hockey on Top - The New York Times,This weekend is Wisconsin forward Annie Pankowski’s last shot to go out a winner in college hockey.,"She is a three-time finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award, which will be given out Saturday to the best female player in college hockey. She has never won.","On Friday, she will play in the Frozen Four with the Wisconsin Badgers for the fourth time. She has never won a national championship.","Top-seeded Wisconsin (33-4-2) faces the two-time defending champion Clarkson (30-7-2) on Friday in the semifinals at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., with Minnesota (31-5-1) and Cornell (24-5-6) vying to play the winner. The title game is Sunday.","“All the previous Frozen Fours have been different, but this one is my last,” Pankowski, 24, said. “As a team, we’re really hungry to win it.”","A native of Laguna Hills, Calif., whose older sister, Ali, played hockey at Princeton, Pankowski started skating at 4 and played on her first United States national team in 2013, before four years at the North American Hockey Academy in Stowe, Vt. At Wisconsin, she was the team’s leading scorer her first two years, and again this year, with 25 goals and 47 points. She won four conference championships with the Badgers.","Yet Pankowski’s hockey career has had devastating setbacks. She was a final cut for the 2014 Olympic team. She did not play for the Badgers in the 2017-18 season as she trained with the national team. But she was cut just weeks before the team was to leave for the Pyeongchang Olympics, after all the players had been assured when training camp began that the 23-person roster was set. The U.S. went on to win the gold medal.","Pankowski called it “one of the most awkward, painful experiences of my life.” The day after she was cut, still “heartbroken, confused and angry,” she said, she began the drive back to Madison, where she knew she would find support among coaches, teammates and friends.","“Those were the people I needed to surround myself with,” she said.","She finished the season practicing with her Wisconsin teammates, and throwing herself into another passion: training dogs.","Since her second semester at Wisconsin, she has been a volunteer at OccuPaws, a local nonprofit that trains guide dogs for people with sight and mobility disabilities. The program requires that the dogs live with her.","“It’s something outside of hockey and school that’s not stressful,” said Pankowski, who often treats her teammates to dog visits at practice. “You can feel the excitement whenever I bring a dog into the locker room.”","Pankowski, the youngest child of two veterinarians, has logged more than 2,000 hours of volunteer time with OccuPaws. That is one of the reasons she is a finalist for another honor: the Hockey Humanitarian Award, which recognizes a male or female player who makes significant contributions to the community through volunteering.","Pankowski also works in the lab of Mark Markel, the dean of Wisconsin’s School of Veterinary Medicine, and she plans to start veterinary school there in August.","“She’s a rock star as an athlete, a student, a volunteer and a worker in my lab,” Markel said. “I think all her hockey experience, including all the international tournaments she’s played in, has given her the discipline to pull off this off.”","Veterinary school is a four-year program, but a yearlong commitment to play in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing is possible, with Markel’s blessing.","“If she needs a year off,” he said, “we’re totally supportive of her.”","For now, though, her focus is on Friday night and Clarkson, the team that beat Wisconsin in the 2017 title game. The Badgers were the top team in the country all of that season and outshot Clarkson, 41-20, but lost, 3-0.","This year, Wisconsin heads into the Frozen Four 10-0-2 in its last 12 games. Pankowski scored Wisconsin’s first two goals in a 4-0 win over Syracuse in the N.C.A.A. quarterfinals last weekend.","Watching the game online, Bill Driscoll, the director of hockey at the North American Hockey Academy, said he knew she would “take this game over.”","“She has an elite-level shot,” he added.","Pankowski was on the U.S. team that won the Four Nations Cup in November, and she will play for the Americans at the world championships in Finland next month. Despite her Olympic disappointments, she has won two gold medals at worlds, in 2015 and 2016.","“She’s very cerebral on the ice,” said Bob Corkum, the national team coach. “She knows the spots to get to. She’s not the fastest skater or the strongest player or even the most skilled, but she’s very well rounded. All she does is put pucks in the net.”","Whatever the results this weekend, Markel said, he had no worries about how Pankowski will handle them.","“I think her resilience is going to be a blessing for her the rest of her life,” he said."

Don’t Call St. Nicholas Hockey Club a ‘Beer League’ Team - The New York Times,"An amateur men’s hockey club claims the ice at Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan at 4 p.m. each Saturday during the fall, winter and spring for a brisk 80-minute scrimmage, with the skaters divided into two teams, and no officials, face-offs or heavy checking.","When these players first step onto the ice, they look like any other group of weekend warriors, but the giveaway is the crest on a few of their jerseys: a shamrock with St.N and 1896.","This is the St. Nicholas Hockey Club, formed in 1896, one of the nation’s first amateur hockey clubs. The players are mostly New York businessmen in their 20s and 30s from Ivy League universities, and they play only a few games a year, but St. Nick’s lives on as an elite club.","“There’s a constant influx of players who replace the people who grow up, if you will,” said Jim Morrissey, 42, a former defenseman at Yale known as Moose, who now lives on the Upper East Side, works in finance and joined St. Nick’s after he moved to New York in 1999.","Morrissey sustained a knee injury during a St. Nick’s skate last year, putting him on the shelf.","“It’s probably a sign that I’m too old to do this anymore,” he said.","But he has vowed to return to the ice. He just loves hockey too much. And these are his friends, his “buds,” as St. Nick’s players call one another. He invited 15 of them to his wedding eight years ago.","Like many other amateur sports teams, St. Nick’s is sort of a social club, and the players who participate in the weekly skates and games make sure to bring beer for the twin purposes of rehydrating and recapping the first-to-five-goals games they just played.","“It’s not a beer league,” said Kevin Kaiser, 31, who joined St. Nick’s in 2011, after playing as a forward at Princeton. “Oh, we definitely drink after. But it’s high-level hockey, for sure.”","Participation is by invitation, and only former college and pro players with strong hockey pedigrees are asked to join. (St. Nick’s recently invited a woman who had played college hockey to join, but she declined.) Annual dues are about $1,000, most of which covers the ice time at Chelsea Piers.","Although professional hockey began to eclipse amateur hockey nearly a century ago, teams like St. Nick’s, especially in New York, formed a foundation for the sport’s growth outside Canada.","According to “Metro Ice,” a 1999 book by Stan Fischler and Tom Sarro, the St. Nicholas Hockey Club joined the New York Athletic Club, the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn and the Skating Club of Brooklyn to form the American Amateur Hockey League in 1896.","St. Nick’s had won three A.A.H.L. championships 10 years before the New York Americans entered the N.H.L. in 1925. (The Rangers joined the N.H.L. a year later.) Hobey Baker, whose name graces the annual award that goes to the N.C.A.A.’s top men’s hockey player, played for St. Nick’s from 1914 to 1916.","Then Baker joined the United States Army Air Service and became a captain and a commander of an aero squadron in World War I. Baker, 26, was killed in a plane crash in 1918 about a month after the armistice. In 1945, he was the first American inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.","The N.H.L. had only six teams from 1942 to 1967, so there were limited professional opportunities for hockey players, especially Americans. Curt Bennett and Herb Boxer were the first American-born players to be selected in the N.H.L. Entry Draft — in 1968.","So amateur teams were popular among American-born players who had exhausted their collegiate eligibility. St. Nick’s, which has long outlasted its three original A.A.H.L. colleagues, drew players from the Ivy League and other Eastern colleges who landed jobs in New York.","The St. Nick’s club played for many years at the St. Nicholas Arena, located at 66th Street and Columbus Avenue and built by the likes of Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor. The arena had one of the first refrigerated ice plants in the world. The club eventually moved to Princeton and to Westchester County, then to Chelsea Piers in 2006.","Pete Bostwick, now 84, played for St. Nick’s from 1959 to 1984 after starring at Middlebury College. He was a stockbroker who lived and worked in Locust Valley on Long Island, but he would join St. Nick’s teammates for practices at Hobey Baker Rink at Princeton, nearly 80 miles away.","“It was so much fun,” Bostwick said. “These guys were really into hockey.”","St. Nick’s spans generations of players. The brothers Steve and John Cook joined in the mid-1960s after playing at Princeton. Their father, Peter, played for St. Nick’s beginning in the 1930s.","“It was a club with a long tradition,” said Steve Cook, 74, a spinal surgeon who lives in Florida and Connecticut. “Everybody knew each other. It was pretty much an Ivy League event.”","John Cook, 80, who played for St. Nick’s before and after he played professionally in Germany in the late 1960s, said, “It was a nice way to meet different guys in different businesses who also had an interest in hockey.”","Steve’s 32-year-old son, Matt, joined St. Nick’s after playing at Union College through 2009, and for four minor league teams over two seasons. He still skates for St. Nick’s, but not as much as he used to, because he just became a father.","“You kind of grew up on St. Nick’s stories,” said Matt Cook, a credit trader who lives on the Upper East Side. “I didn’t know they still existed. It was like a new lease of life.”","St. Nick’s used to play several Eastern colleges regularly, but its schedule now consists of a handful of games against other elite-level clubs. This season St. Nick’s played a game against the Wissahickon Skating Club, of Philadelphia, and two against a team in Vail, Colo., in February.","The club no longer has a physical headquarters like St. Nicholas Arena, which closed in 1962 and was replaced later by WABC-TV studios. But the team does have an email list with a pool of more than 50 potential players for its weekly scrimmages.","St. Nick’s does not have the hockey reputation it had a century ago, or even more recently, when it won 10 national amateur titles in the senior elite, senior and open divisions from 1994 to 2005. But the players are determined to extend the club’s rich history.","“Some of us like to limp to work for a couple of months,” Morrissey said."
"Spring’s Best New Romance Novels: Hockey Players, Werewolves, 19th-Century Farmers and More - The New York Times","The discussion of modernized farming methods might not sound like the stuff of romance novels, but that all depends on how handsome the man doing the talking is. Lisa Kleypas’s DEVIL’S DAUGHTER (Avon, paper, $7.99) is the platonic ideal of historical romance, witty and lush and tender all at once. Phoebe is a young widow and mother of two boys, just coming out of mourning for her beloved husband. She heads to her brother’s wedding festivities knowing that West Ravenel, her husband’s boarding school tormentor, will be there, as he’s the bride’s cousin. What she doesn’t expect is to find a man who makes her feel “that shaky, embarrassing, inexplicable desire to press her body intimately against someone else’s.” Even less expected (for Phoebe, but a delightful setup for the reader): That man is West Ravenel.","Kleypas wisely spreads the developments that follow over several months instead of cramming them into the wedding weekend; while Phoebe and West’s attraction is instant, their capitulation is not. West, a younger son, is manager of his family’s estate, and soon he begins to mentor Phoebe, who’s responsible for her own land until her sons come of age. West advocates for modernized farming, and even camaraderie with his tenant farmers — it is 1877, after all.","The gulf between the school-age West Ravenel of whom Phoebe had heard such horrific tales and the funny, generous, thoughtful man she comes to know is, thankfully, reconciled without any illogically hoarded secrets or overwrought reveals. Just as nicely handled is Phoebe’s first love — though her relationship with her first husband bloomed gently out of a childhood friendship, it’s never disparaged for lacking the heat that Phoebe feels with West. It’s a view of love as cleareyed and mature as everything else in this book, though in Phoebe and West’s case, Kleypas proves that cleareyed and mature doesn’t preclude pulse-raising. ","Paranormal romances can have a daunting buy-in. Elaborate world-building can make catching up mid-series difficult — and authors must walk a delicate line between high fantasy and unintentional camp. All of this makes Maria Vale’s FOREVER WOLF (Sourcebooks Casablanca, paper, $7.99) an impressive accomplishment: It’s Book 3 in a series but a welcoming starting point, and Vale’s world of werewolves, though grave, is never self-serious. Crucial to this success is Vale’s narrator, Varya, once an outsider, now a ranking member of the pack. (There’s a lot of lore to learn about Varya’s pack, from hierarchical structure to phrases in the pack’s Old Tongue, which looks a lot like Old English, but Vale keeps everything accessible.) Varya is intense and severe, almost caught off-guard by the feelings she develops for the lone wolf she finds one day, nearly dying of injuries he sustained when caught in an illegal trap.",[ Read Jaime Green’s last romance novel column ],"To back up for a moment, I should explain Vale’s wolves. They don’t call themselves werewolves — and scoff at humans who would — but that’s roughly what they are, able to shift between human and wolf forms, except for three days around the full moon, when all must be wolves. The pack’s greatest enemies aren’t meddling humans, but Shifters, who’ve abandoned the deep traditions of pack life — and the pull of the moon — to integrate into, and profit from, human society. Some pack members also live in the human world, protecting the pack’s legal and financial interests, but as a new threat from Shifters encroaches, they’re all called home to the pack’s land in the Adirondacks. And as that crisis escalates, Varya must keep the secret of the strange lone wolf she’s found, and of her growing feelings for him. That wolf, Eyulf, is appealingly affable, but Varya’s a surprising pleasure for a reader to spend time with. She’s often stoic and severe, with a reserve born out of early trauma, but she also has a powerful yearning for connection. Watching her come to terms with her own vulnerability is as moving, and central to the story, as watching her and Eyulf fall in love.",,"Like many romances, Sarina Bowen’s OVERNIGHT SENSATION (Tuxbury, paper, $15) hinges on some minor plot acrobatics to force its central couple to spend time together. It’s not enough that Heidi Jo Pepper is the office intern for the Brooklyn Bruisers, the hockey team on which Jason Castro plays. Well, it almost is, at first, when at a post-practice bar one night the two are about to give in to a long-simmering attraction. But then Heidi, a perpetual good girl thrilled with the possibility of being approximately 2 percent bad, overdoes it on tequila shots, and Jason has her crash on his couch when she refuses to go home so drunk, because home would be Daddy’s condo. And Daddy, Jason soon realizes, is the league’s commissioner. Daddy is also plenty pissed when he sees a gossip-blog photo of Jason carrying a very drunk Heidi back to his apartment.","Heidi’s already in hot water for dropping out of college, so Daddy downgrades her internship to a 10-week rotation through some of the hockey league’s most menial jobs — selling hot dogs, working stadium security, cleaning bathrooms. She can’t say no — there’s the hope of a permanent position at the end of her trials — but she can’t handle staying in Daddy’s condo anymore. And so that is why Heidi keeps living with Jason (and his teammate roommate). In practice, this plot feels elaborate but not overwrought, anchored by Heidi’s sincere drive to figure out who she is when she’s not the good Southern girl she’s been raised to be. Her slightly strange, slightly manic energy keeps her arc feeling fresh; Jason’s need to learn to talk about his feelings comes across as a bit more pat, but, sadly, isn’t unrealistic. And there’s so much more happening in this sprightly book — Heidi’s odd jobs, two entire unrelated scandals, plenty of hockey — that as soon as the momentum flags you’re on to the next play. ","The world of speculative romance is rife with werewolves and shape-shifters, angels and demons and oh so many vampires, but spaceships are woefully thin on the ground (and in the air). Even if that weren’t the case, even if some of us weren’t desperate for romance to colonize the cosmos, Jessie Mihalik’s splendid POLARIS RISING (Harper Voyager, paper, $16.99) would be a thrill of a book. Ada von Hasenberg is the fifth child of one of the three royal houses of the universe’s ruling Consortium. She’s been on the run for the last two years, fleeing an arranged marriage with the son of a rival house. When she finds herself about to be captured by her intended, she manages to escape with a fellow prisoner: Marcus Loch, the Devil of Fornax Zero, and the most wanted man in the universe. Ada soon discovers that the small ship they’ve stolen for their escape holds secrets that could topple the universe’s delicate balance of power.","Mihalik’s universe is vividly imagined, with exposition given with a refreshing directness (and no reliance on characters spouting awkward as-you-knows). The book is told entirely from Ada’s point of view, offering the reader no more insight past Loch’s cold exterior than Ada herself has. It’s a risk on Mihalik’s part — Loch starts out menacing and mysterious, and he always remains a bit opaque — but it pays off as the reader, right along with Ada, gets to treasure every small crack in his stoic facade. Besides, Ada’s a tremendous heroine, brilliant and capable but never infallible, and I wouldn’t want to give up a moment with her. The set pieces skew toward sci-fi, but the burgeoning attraction between Ada and Loch is just as important to the story. This is space-opera adventure and sweeping romance in equal parts, an enthralling and eminently satisfying book."
"Citing Concussion-Related Symptoms, Rick Nash Retires From Hockey - The New York Times","Rick Nash, a No. 1 overall N.H.L. draft pick and a star for the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Rangers, has retired because of concussion-related symptoms, his agent said Friday.","Nash, 34, trailed only Alex Ovechkin and Patrick Marleau in career goals among active players with 437. He also had 368 assists in 1,060 career games.","“Due to unresolved issues/symptoms from the concussion sustained last March, Rick Nash will be forced to retire from the game of hockey,” his agent, Joe Resnick, said in a statement. “Under the advice of his medical team, the risk of further brain injury is far too great if Rick returns to play.”","The Columbus Blue Jackets selected Nash, from Brampton, Ontario, in the 2002 draft. He entered the league at 18 and spent the first nine seasons with Columbus. He remains the franchise’s career leader in goals and points. In 2012, the Blue Jackets traded him to the Rangers, with whom he spent six seasons, and he also played 11 games with the Boston Bruins in 2018 after being traded there in February.","It was with the Bruins that he sustained his most recent concussion, in March, though he did return for the playoffs. Another concussion, with the Rangers in 2013, caused him to miss six weeks.",He was a free agent entering this season but told teams at the start of free agency that he was not yet ready to play.,He led the N.H.L. in goals with 41 in 2003-4 and tallied a career-high 42 goals in 2014-15.

Driver of Truck That Killed Canadian Hockey Players Barreled Through Stop Sign at 60 M.P.H. - The New York Times,OTTAWA — The driver of a truck pulling two trailers laden with bales of peat moss roared past four warning signs and an oversized stop sign at highway speed just before it was struck by a bus carrying a Saskatchewan hockey team last April.,"The collision at an intersection killed 16 people, most of them young players on the Humboldt Broncos, injured 13 and spread sorrow throughout Canada.","But the details of precisely what happened on April 6, 2018, only emerged on Tuesday after Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, the truck driver, pleaded guilty in a Saskatchewan court. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation obtained a copy of a statement of facts negotiated by prosecutors and Mr. Sidhu’s lawyers.","The five page document, based on an exhaustive investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, concluded that Glen Doerksen, the driver of the bus, had tried to avoid an unavoidable collision. The bus skidded nearly 80 feet before striking the truck’s trailers. There were no skid marks from the truck.","“The driver of the bus did not contribute to the collision,” the statement said. “The actions of Mr. Sidhu while operating the semi-tractor unit caused the collision.”","Mr. Doerksen was among the dead from the crash, which left both vehicles well off the road and showered the intersection with peat moss and debris.","Exactly why Mr. Sidhu did not heed the warning signs and failed to obey a four-foot wide stop sign with a flashing light is unclear. The investigation found that Mr. Sidhu had not been impaired by alcohol and had not been using a phone. The road was dry and clear, and weather did not impair his vision of the intersection.",All the statement found was that Mr. Sidhu had “failed to recognize that his vehicle was approaching an intersection and did not heed the stop sign.” The report estimated the truck was traveling at about 60 miles an hour through the intersection.,"Mr. Sidhu, who lives in Calgary, Alberta, had only been driving heavy trucks for about two weeks. He had two weeks of prior training.","Outside of the courthouse in Melfort, Saskatchewan, on Tuesday, Mark Brayford, a lawyer, said that when he recently took over Mr. Sidhu’s defense, the driver said that he had wanted to plead guilty.","“I can’t make things any better but I certainly don’t want to make them worse by having a trial,” Mr. Brayford quoted his client as saying. “He wanted the families to know that he’s devastated by the grief that he’s caused them.”",The Broncos had been on a two-hour trip north to a playoff game in the town of Nipawin. The players came from throughout Canada and stayed with Humboldt’s families.,"Long bus trips to games had been a regular part of life for the players, who ranged in age from 16 to 21. For many, the Broncos could have been a way to a college athletic scholarship or a pathway to a professional team.","One player still remains hospitalized in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.","Canadians have left hockey sticks outside their doorways in memory of the dead, who also included team officials. A fund-raising campaign for survivors and victims’ families raised more than $11 million.",Mr. Sidhu pleaded guilty to 16 counts of dangerous driving causing death and 13 counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the death-related charge is 14 years and 10 years for the injury charges.,A sentencing hearing was scheduled for Jan. 28.,"“If he spends a day, if he spends 10 years times, that’s irrelevant,” Scott Thomas, the father of Evan Thomas, 18, who was killed in the crash, told reporters outside of the courthouse. “He was guilty, he acknowledged that. That’s all I needed to hear.”"
Jerry Westrom Threw Away a Napkin Last Month. It Was Used to Charge Him in a 1993 Murder. - The New York Times,"A Minnesota man was eating a hot dog at a hockey game when, the authorities said, he wiped his mouth with a napkin and tossed the remains in the trash.",It was the moment cold-case investigators had been waiting for.,"The authorities, who had used a genealogy company to identify the man as a suspect in an unsolved murder from 1993, dug the napkin out of the trash and used DNA on it to tie him to the case, court records show.","The man, Jerry Westrom, 52, was arrested last week by the Minneapolis Police Department and charged with murder in the death of Jeanne Ann Childs, a 35-year-old woman who was stabbed to death in a Minneapolis apartment nearly 26 years ago.","Mr. Westrom has denied involvement in the case, according to the authorities. A representative from a law firm representing him declined to comment on Sunday.","Federal and local authorities used genealogy to identify a suspect and then worked surreptitiously to retrieve a DNA sample from Mr. Westrom, a businessman who lives in Isanti, Minn., and has a wife and three children, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune.","The strategy was popularized last year after the authorities used an online genealogy database to make an arrest in the case of the Golden State Killer, who had burglarized, raped and murdered people across California over decades. Since then, genealogical sleuthing techniques have led to arrests in cases in Washington State, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.","But the tactic has also raised ethical concerns about using genetic information from people who might have uploaded their DNA to find information about their heritage, without knowing it could help law enforcement officials track down family members.","GEDmatch, an open-source ancestry site used in the Golden State Killer case, updated its privacy policy after that case to make explicitly clear that law enforcement may access a person’s profile to solve murder and sexual assault cases. And FamilyTreeDNA, one of the country’s largest at-home genetic testing companies, recently apologized to its users for failing to disclose that it was sharing DNA data with federal investigators.","More than 15 million people have offered up their DNA to online genealogy services in recent years. While they represent a small fraction of all people, the pool of profiles is large enough to allow 60 percent of white Americans — the primary users of DNA sites in the United States — to be identified through the databases, according to researchers. Researchers believe that in the coming years, 90 percent of Americans of European descent will be identifiable, even if they have not submitted their own DNA.","At a news conference last week, Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, did not specify which service investigators had used, but said that “it was a genealogy company you see advertised on TV.”",He said he did not know whether it was Mr. Westrom himself or a relative who had uploaded the genetic information.,"In June 1993, Ms. Childs was found dead in a flooded Minneapolis apartment. She was lying on the floor, wearing only a pair of socks, with the shower still running, according to the statement of probable cause in the case.","Ms. Childs, who had been working as a prostitute, was stabbed repeatedly, including after she had died, the authorities said. The authorities collected DNA from the crime scene, including from a comforter on the bed, a towel in the bathroom and a washcloth on the toilet seat, according to the statement.","But for a quarter of a century, the case remained unsolved.","A break came last year, when investigators entered DNA from the crime scene into genealogy websites and identified two possible suspects. One of the suspects, Mr. Westrom, had lived in the Twin Cities area in the early 1990s and had been convicted of soliciting prostitution in 2016, the probable cause statement said.","In January, officers began following Mr. Westrom and eventually tracked him to the hockey game. They watched him order food from the concession area and then wipe his mouth with a napkin, before placing the napkin in a cardboard food container and throwing it away, the authorities said.","DNA found on the napkin “was consistent with” samples taken from the 1993 crime scene, according to the probable cause statement.",The police arrested Mr. Westrom at his office on Monday.,"Once he was in custody, the authorities collected another sample of DNA, which matched sperm found on the comforter and the towel in the bathroom, and could not be excluded as a match for the washcloth on the toilet seat, the probable cause statement said.","“We all hope Jeanne’s family can finally find peace as a result of this tenacious effort by officers and agents,” Jill Sanborn, the special agent in charge of the Minneapolis division of the F.B.I., said in a statement.","Mr. Westrom told the authorities that he did not know Ms. Childs and had not been at the apartment, and he denied having had sex with any women in Minneapolis in 1993, according to the probable cause statement.","In a court appearance on Friday, Steven J. Meshbesher, a lawyer for Mr. Westrom, said that the arrest had been premature and said his client intended to plead not guilty, MPR News reported. Records show Mr. Westrom was released on bail Friday night.","At the news conference last week, Mr. Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, recalled how he had talked with the district attorney in Ventura County, Calif., about the genealogy used in the Golden State Killer case.","“I said, ‘You know, I bet we have some cases back home we can use this on,’” he said. “Well, we just found one.”"

The Lightning’s Record-Setting Season Seeks a Stanley Cup Capper - The New York Times,TORONTO — The former N.H.L. executive Brian Burke sat high in the stands at Scotiabank Arena last Thursday watching the Tampa Bay Lightning practice ahead of a game against the Maple Leafs.,"“They remind me of the Dallas Cowboys in their heyday,” said Burke, who won a Stanley Cup as general manager of the Anaheim Ducks in 2007. “No weaknesses and a lot of star power.”","Tampa Bay went on to beat Toronto that night, 3-1, and two days later, closed out the Boston Bruins, 6-3, for its record-tying 62nd win this season.","With a 62-16-4 record, the Lightning tied the 1995-96 Red Wings for the most wins in a season. And Tampa Bay, with 128 points, fell just short of one huge benchmark — the record 132 points achieved by the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens (60-8-12), who were regarded as one of the best, if not the best, N.H.L. teams ever.","Tampa Bay finished with 12 more wins, and 21 more points, than the next closest team, the Calgary Flames. The Lightning did not lose more than two consecutive games all season. ",But winning the Presidents’ Trophy as the best regular-season team is far from a guarantee of postseason success. The 1976-77 Canadiens won the Stanley Cup; the 1995-96 Red Wings did not. ,"On the 32 previous occasions that the Presidents’ Trophy has been awarded, only eight regular-season champions, or 25 percent, followed up with Stanley Cup titles. The last one was the Chicago Blackhawks in 2012-13.",The Lightning begin their first-round playoff series against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday well aware that history may regard them as a bust — or not regard them at all — if they don’t win a championship.,[Complete first-round schedule.],"The division-based playoff format, introduced for the 2013-14 season, does not help the Lightning’s cause.",Tampa Bay and Boston both play in the Atlantic Division and were the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. But one of them won’t get past the second round.,"Lightning Coach Jon Cooper understands that success is often built on failure. Sometimes repeated failure. Under his tutelage, Tampa Bay advanced to three conference finals in the last four years and reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2015.","A dozen or so players are left from that 2014-15 team, which lost to the Blackhawks in six games. Back then, Cooper said, he struggled to stay positive as he exchanged handshakes with the winners.","In the handshake lineup was Scotty Bowman, a nine-time Stanley Cup winner as a coach and Chicago’s senior adviser of hockey operations.",Cooper will never forget what Bowman told him.,"“You’ll be back soon,” said Bowman, who happens to have been the coach of the 1976-77 Canadiens and the 1995-96 Red Wings. “Don’t worry about it. I lost my first 12 Stanley Cup finals games.”","The Lightning lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games the next year. Then last season Tampa Bay — already loaded with superstar talent in forwards Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov, goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy and defenseman Victor Hedman — added what it thought were the final two pieces by acquiring defenseman Ryan McDonagh and forward J.T. Miller from the Rangers at the trade deadline. ",But the Lightning lost to the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals in seven games. ,"In their first full season in Tampa Bay, McDonagh has had a resurgent season, ranking No. 2 in the league with a plus-38 rating, and Miller tallied 47 points.","“This is the effect you’re getting,” Cooper said. “A year later, when everybody is more comfortable, and they know what grocery store to go to, now they’re here just to play hockey. There are no other distractions, and we’re reaping the benefits of last year’s trade deadline.”",Other off-season adjustments have paid dividends.,"Tampa Bay has No. 1-ranked power play and penalty killing units, but last season the Lightning were ranked 28th out of 31 teams in penalty killing efficiency.","Rick Bowness, who oversaw the defensive unit, was let go along with assistant coach Brad Lauer. Derek Lalonde was hired with Jeff Halpern to work with the forwards, and Todd Richards was hired to focus on the defense.","During a nine-game stretch in November, the Lightning gave up 13 power-play goals. Richards called a players meeting. The players took ownership of the problems and became more attentive to the “habit reminders” the coaches like to drill into them, like finishing their checks.","“It takes away holes in your game when you’re constantly doing things correctly,” Lalonde said.","Cooper saw signs that Kucherov, 25, was filling holes in his game this off-season, when he stayed in the Tampa area and rented a rink by himself so he could skate five days a week.","“His hockey mind is so elite and the physical side is catching up,” Cooper said.","Kucherov finished with 128 points, the most for a Russian player in N.H.L. history and the most for a league scoring champion since Mario Lemieux’s 161 in the 1995-96 season. He is the favorite to win the Hart Trophy as the league’s most valuable player.","Kucherov’s emergence has taken the pressure off Stamkos, 29, to be the dominant star. Stamkos responded by surpassing the 40-goal mark for the first time since 2014-15, and he hit a career high with 98 points. Kucherov, who is sneaky quick with the puck and makes good reads, also helped center Brayden Point score a career-high 41 goals. ","Leading them all is Cooper, 51. Bowman, who follows the Lightning closely from his home in Sarasota, Fla., traces the team’s success to 2011-12, when Cooper showed an ability to put teams on a roll and keep them there.","He led the Norfolk Admirals, the Lightning’s American Hockey League affiliate at the time, to a record 28-game winning streak that culminated in a Calder Cup championship.","In March 2013, the Lightning promoted Cooper, who was a public defender in Michigan before making coaching his career. He has perfected the art of persuasion and negotiation with his players.","“He just has that balance in today’s N.H.L.,” said Lalonde, one of Cooper’s assistants. “He can be hard on players, but he cares about them too. The guys know he has their back.”",Cooper has claimed championships in the A.H.L. and in three junior hockey leagues. A Silver Cup. A Robertson Cup. A Clark Cup. A Calder Cup. ,"The Stanley Cup has eluded him, but this year, just maybe, it could be Cooper’s turn. "
'Good Luck!' Lightning Carry Burden of Presidents' Trophy - The New York Times,Jon Cooper and Todd Reirden were coaching at the All-Star Game in January when the topic of winning the Presidents' Trophy came up.,"With Cooper's Tampa Bay Lightning cruising toward winning it as the NHL's best team, he asked the Washington coach how to handle it. Reirden was less than helpful.","""I said: 'Good luck! I don't know what you're talking about,'"" Reirden recalled with a grin.","Finishing at the top of the league comes with expectations, but only two of 13 Presidents' Trophy winners in the salary cap era have gone on to win the Stanley Cup and none since 2013. If this is the burden to bear for Tampa Bay, the Lightning seem OK with it.","""Nobody in there is sitting there thinking now we've got a path to the Stanley Cup finals,"" Cooper said. ""As a matter of fact, actually the odds are probably grossly against us just in the sense there's going to be 15 other teams. Any time you go in somewhere and say, 'OK, we're going to pick this team' and somebody's got the field, usually the field is the teams to take.""","Taking the field this time means betting against a team that was 21 points clear of anyone else in the league, has the top scorer and likely MVP in Nikita Kucherov, a Vezina Trophy candidate in goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy and looks built for this moment. Of course, so did the Nashville Predators last year.","When the Predators clinched the Presidents' Trophy against the Capitals, who won it the previous two years, winger Filip Forsberg said: ""We've seen especially here that the trophy doesn't mean that much going forward.""","It didn't, and Nashville lost in the second round to Winnipeg in seven games.",The Capitals have won the Presidents' Trophy three times in the Alex Ovechkin era — under coach Bruce Boudreau in 2010 and Barry Trotz in 2016 and 2017 (with Reirden as his top assistant) — and lost in the first or second round each time.,"""Obviously it comes with a little bit of pressure,"" Capitals center Nicklas Backstrom said. ""You are the best team in the regular season and you obviously have more work to do I think than just regular season.""","Boudreau, now with Minnesota, said the pressure stems from constant questions players face because ""they can't away from it"" more than a feeling of internal superiority. But nine years after getting beaten by red-hot goaltender Jaroslav Halak and Montreal in the first round, Boudreau vividly remembers a Game 6 feeling of, ""Oh my God, if we lose this game!""",They did. Tampa Bay defenseman Braydon Coburn remembers it clearly because it helped pave the way for his run to the Cup Final with Philadelphia. He and his Lightning teammates are keenly aware of other teams' missteps in the same spot they find themselves in now.,"""You look to the past,"" Coburn said. ""You try to take them as lessons. I don't think you try to psych yourself out in any sort of way. But I think you look back to that Washington series against Montreal, I remember it very well. It was Halak. He played out of his mind. That's the thing about playoffs is you never know what's going to happen.""","What should happen based on 1,271 regular season games is Steven Stamkos raising the Stanley Cup over his head in June. But that was also the case for the San Jose Sharks in 2009 with Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau in their primes, and they, too, lost in the first round.","""It's one of those things you can't let down your guard,"" said Marleau, now with Toronto. ""You can't feel comfortable for a second. It's a brand new season. Anything can happen. There's bounces, inches. It's a game of inches. Just not to take your foot off the gas. If anything, it's the time to really bear down.""","The Lightning clinched the NHL's best record with several games left in the season, which takes away some of urgency on the ice — in a bad way.","""We weren't playing playoff hockey — we were playing high-end, regular-season hockey, which is a big difference,"" said Minnesota's Eric Fehr, who was on that Capitals team in 2010. ""It's just the intensity of taking the puck to the net and not playing as much on the perimeter and not trying to make fancy plays. You see the high-end teams in the regular season, they're making fancy plays, they're scoring 3-on-2 goals. You get to the playoffs and it's point shots, tips and battles in front of the net. That's the difference is you have to be playing that style of game come playoff time.""","Tampa Bay was the highest-scoring team in the league, so it's an adjustment to playoff-style hockey but something the group is used to after reaching the Eastern Conference finals last year. Forward Adam Erne said the ""sour taste"" from a seven-game loss to Washington is a motivation, and more experienced teammates are trying to impart some knowledge about what to do next.","""Just keep a present mind frame,"" said defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who won the Presidents' Trophy with the New York Rangers in 2015. ""That' been the best thing with this group all year is we've just focused on each day at a time and not look at big picture and what's going on around us, what's going on with other teams.""","All well and good, but previous top teams have done the same and not been able to live up to the billing. Carolina captain Justin Williams played on the 2016 and 2017 Capitals Presidents' Trophy winning teams and acknowledged maybe it played a role in players gripping their sticks a little too tightly in the playoffs.","""It's really hard to get in and there's really no clear favorites once you get in,"" Williams said.

""We're just looking to build as deep of a team as possible, and I think we've done a good job of that.""","That includes what has been Vegas' top line the past two seasons: Jonathan Marchessault, William Karlsson and Reilly Smith — the team's top three points scorers, with 59, 56 and 53, respectively.","Stone leads everyone with 73 points, but 62 came with Ottawa, before he arrived in Las Vegas.","Coach Gerard Gallant doesn't see a difference in the lines consisting of his top six forwards, as he tends to alternate the two in the starting lineup.","""Truthfully, there's no second line for me,"" said Gallant, last year's Jack Adams Award winner. ""There's a lot of talent in both of those lines and when both of them are playing well, everything's going right, it's a tough team to beat.""","Then there's the bottom six, which on any given night has produced all the offense the Golden Knights need.","Alex Tuch ranks fourth on the team with 52 points, Cody Eakin is sixth with 41 points and the goal-scoring duo has given the Golden Knights depth at the third line, something they lacked last June when the Washington Capitals celebrated their first Stanley Cup title on Vegas' home ice.","The fourth line of Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, William Carrier and Ryan Reaves is the blue-collar line that can wreak havoc from a physical standpoint, or produce offense when the opposition least expects it.","Reaves leads the league with 305 hits, while Carrier ranks fourth with 277.","""We know what we can and can't do,"" Stone said. ""We need to be playing our style of hockey at the right time, which is whenever the playoffs start. We've had spurts of great hockey, but as far as putting a 60-minute game together, we haven't quite done that yet.""","The Golden Knights' depth, and offensive potential to break out in any given game, could cause problems for San Jose, which hasn't had the consistency it would like between the pipes. Out of 56 goalies who made 20-plus starts this season, Sharks starter Martin Jones ranks 52nd in save percentage at .896. His backup, Aaron Dell, is last at .886.","And with what appears to be a healthy roster heading into the postseason, Gallant has a stable of forwards he can call upon to play on any line, at any time. For the second year in a row, their mindset isn't about proving they belong on a specific line, it's about how eager they are to play alongside different teammates when needed to help the team.","""You have a good culture, good group of guys, good work ethic, you look around the room and everyone is humble and having fun,"" Eakin said. ""There's gonna be times all year where guys are going down, guys are jumping around, lots of different line combinations. But you get a good, hardworking group of guys without egos, that's when the fun happens. That's when you can gel and bond and develop some chemistry.","""It comes from good, strong work ethic from the guys, good guys that want to do better for each other than just for themselves.""",___
Islanders Prove They're for Real in Sweep of Penguins - The New York Times,PITTSBURGH — The expectations were modest at first. The New York Islanders simply wanted to be better than the team that allowed the most goals in the NHL in 2017-18. Tougher to play against. Smarter on both ends of the ice.,"Momentum built slowly. A midseason surge under new head coach Barry Trotz gave them confidence. The goaltending of Robin Lehner and Thomas Greiss, too. Still, even a surprising second-place finish in the Metropolitan Division and the franchise's best regular season in 35 years couldn't stop the Islanders from being underdogs heading into their first-round series against Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins.",So much for that.,"Over the course of four games, the Islanders put on a defensive clinic that left one of the league's marquee teams searching for answers and left little doubt their turnaround under Trotz is very real. New York finished off a sweep with a poised 3-1 win in Game 4 that propelled it to the Eastern Conference semifinals for just the second time since 1993.","The Islanders held Pittsburgh to just six goals, trailed for less than five minutes the entire series and didn't buckle late in the clincher despite losing defenseman Johnny Boychuck and forward Cal Clutterbuck to injuries in the second period. When the final horn sounded, New York found itself shaking hands and moving on after needing a little over 12 periods to bring Pittsburgh's 13th straight playoff appearance to an abrupt and decisive halt.","""Obviously no one predicted this,"" Islanders forward Anders Lee said. ""The guys in the room, we set out from day one to get better each day, to grow throughout the season and then when this time came here we were prepared as best as we could to be ready for this playoff hockey. I think we've proven that a little bit.""","Or maybe more than a little bit. The Penguins — who know a thing or two about what it takes to thrive this time of year — didn't exactly make excuses after getting swept in the first round for just the second time in franchise history. The Islanders were faster, more determined and more disciplined from the opening puck drop of Game 1 right on through.","""We didn't execute well and made a few more mistakes than they did,"" said Crosby, whose assist on Jake Guentzel's goal served as the captain's lone point of the series.","It's the Islanders' way, one that carried them into a second-round matchup against either Washington or Carolina. Trotz is well aware of a chance he could find himself facing the team he led to the Stanley Cup a year ago. Yeah, it might be a little weird. There are worse problems to have.","""That's a special group that will always be a part of me,"" Trotz said. ""But if we end up playing them, they're the opposition.""","Whoever faces the Islanders will have to find a way to successfully navigate a defensive system that forces opponents to go through wave after wave of players in search of open space. The Penguins rarely found any while scoring just six times in four games and when they did, Lehner was almost always in perfect position. He stopped 135 of the 141 shots he faced and is getting a little tired of the notion what the Islanders are doing is a surprise.","""We have a good team,"" Lehner said. ""We've been overlooked a little bit, but we have a lot of high-end skill on this team and we showed that this series.""","Just as importantly, they showed it at the right time. Jordan Eberle scored in each game, including a shot that zipped past Matt Murray in the first period that evened the score just 94 seconds after Guentzel had given the Penguins an early lead.","""They get momentum, you hear the crowd cheering, they score first and you're able to get the next one and kind of quiet them down, that's big,"" Eberle said.",And the kind of thing the Islanders hope will carry over. They'll have at least a week off before continuing a season that will extend into early May. Heady territory for a group that had just one playoff series victory since 1993 before taking out the Penguins.,There's more work to be done. New York understands it doesn't play a particularly sexy brand of hockey. It also doesn't care. It works in the playoffs. That's more than enough.,"""Early on I think a lot of people wrote us off,"" Eberle said. ""They were a bit shocked. But we're confident in the way that we play. The way that the group is here, this is one of the tighter knit teams that I've played on. We love battling and playing for each other. You do that every night on a consistent basis and you can go places.""",___
'Jerk' Hurricanes Surge Into 1st Playoff Series Since 2009 - The New York Times,"RALEIGH, N.C. — They traded punches with Evander Holyfield. They dunked a basketball on ice. They flopped around like beached whales.","The Carolina Hurricanes have done plenty of unusual things this season, and here is one more: They are preparing for their first playoff series in a decade.","That team dubbed a ""bunch of jerks"" over their wild, choreographed post-victory celebrations hopes to surge — or, perhaps more fittingly, Storm Surge — all the way to the Stanley Cup.","The Hurricanes, who open their first best-of-seven playoff series since 2009 on Thursday night at defending Cup champion Washington, are walking the fine line between savoring their rare-for-them accomplishment while not being completely satisfied with just making the field of 16.","""You never know when you're going to be back in this situation,"" 37-year-old captain Justin Williams said, ""because making the playoffs is hard — as people in this area know.""","Oh, do they know.","It has been nine seasons since the Hurricanes last skated in a springtime game that mattered. Only two franchises have gone longer between postseason appearances — the Florida Panthers from 2001-11 and the Edmonton Oilers from 2007-16, with each missing the playoffs for 10 straight seasons.",Yet first-year coach Rod Brind'Amour isn't just happy to be here.,"""We're certainly expecting more — this isn't what we signed up for,"" he said. ""We all understand it's a huge task, but we're not going into this series not expecting to win, that's for sure.""","The only current Carolina player who was on the ice for the Hurricanes' last postseason series was center Jordan Staal — who at the time played for Pittsburgh, which swept those Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference finals.","To finally end that drought, Carolina changed just about everything, from the players on the ice all the way up to the team owner. Tom Dundon bought a majority stake in the team from longtime owner Peter Karmanos Jr. last January, then promoted Don Waddell to general manager and hired Brind'Amour — who, as captain of the title-winning team in 2006, was the first player to hoist the Stanley Cup — as head coach.","Along the way, the team's culture changed. Williams was selected as team captain after a failed experiment last year in which Staal and Justin Faulk shared the captaincy, and the players became more accountable to each other.","""Guys expect more out of themselves and expect more out of each other,"" Williams said. ""And when we challenge each other to be better players, that's the only way to improve as a team.""","They're also having more fun after games, thanks to those Storm Surges.","Each one started with a slow, exaggerated overhead clap and ended with a different skit or activity. They celebrated March Madness by bringing a portable basketball hoop onto the ice and Trevor van Riemsdyk threw down a one-handed dunk . When Holyfield visited as a guest, they brought him onto the ice and the former boxing champ pretended to spar with Jordan Martinook. They marked Hartford Whalers night by flopping around on the ice like whales.","And when veteran hockey broadcaster Don Cherry ripped the celebrations and called the Hurricanes a ""bunch of jerks,"" they turned the insult into a rallying cry — even selling T-shirts with the slogan at the team shop.","Even as Williams announced the team's decision to halt the Surges late in the season, he left the door open for their return by calling them ""unpredictable.""","So was this playoff appearance. Just a few months ago, the Hurricanes were 15-17-5 on Dec. 30 and one point out of last place in the East.","Since then, they have gone 31-12-2.","""A lot of people that didn't watch our team all year, they were, 'What happened?' and I don't know that anything happened,"" Brind'Amour said. ""The puck just started to go in. I still think the first 25 games were the best segment of our season, and yet our record didn't show it, so what do I know? ... I can't tell you the change. When pucks started going in, I think you could see they had a little bit more swagger.""","So now, on a day usually reserved for melting the ice at PNC Arena, they were doing something different to it — placing the playoff logos inside the blue lines.","For Williams, who scored the winning goal in Game 7 of Carolina's Cup run 13 years ago and came back before last season to try to bring the franchise back to those heights, it's particularly satisfying.","""I think the atmosphere's going to be electric,"" Williams said. ""Still to this day, (Game 7 was) one of the loudest buildings I've ever been a part of. And playoff hockey coming back to the area, people are going to be ready. I know that.""",___

Williams Ready for Canes' 1st Home Playoff Game in a Decade - The New York Times,"RALEIGH, N.C. — The last time Justin Williams played in a postseason game in Raleigh, he skated off with the Stanley Cup.","The stakes aren't quite that high — yet — for the Carolina Hurricanes, but the third game of their best-of-seven series with the Washington Capitals on Monday night does bring his career full circle.","Now, ""Mr. Game 7"" is ready for Game 3 — the first playoff game at PNC Arena in 10 years — and hoping to keep the Hurricanes from falling into a three-games-to-none hole.","""The anticipation of it is what's getting people really excited, because a lot of people don't really know what it is,"" Williams said.

It being a while now, you can kind of sometimes forget and fall into that trap that we've talked about of normalcy. But it's everything it's cracked up to be.""","Williams had a lot to do with creating the reputation that had gone dormant during that decade-long drought. As a 24-year-old in 2006, he helped the Hurricanes win the Stanley Cup, and his empty-net goal in Game 7 stands as one of the enduring images in club history. He had been traded to Los Angeles when Carolina made its only postseason appearance since, in 2009.","In the second year of his return, he wants to make more memories during a series he called the ""perfect storm"" because of his strong ties to both franchises.","He spent just two seasons in Washington from 2015-17, and lost in the second round both years, but Capitals players and executives credit him for helping to lay the foundation of the team that last year won the Cup for the first time.","""He spoke when he needed to.

You just be yourself,"" Williams said. ""Fortunately, I've been around a lot of great leaders, so I've taken little bits and pieces of what I like about them and kind of make it my own. One of the more important things is, you can't fake being a leader. You can't manufacture being a leader. You just are. And you've got to try and do what you can. You can't be bashful about it. You believe in yourself, or you don't.""","His teammates say that role suits him, and he's instilled a level of accountability that perhaps wasn't always present during a drought that ranked as one of the longest in NHL history.","He also backed up his occasionally harsh words on the ice, ranking second on the team with 23 goals and third with 53 points while helping Carolina close the regular season by going 31-12-2 in its final 45 regular-season games to climb from last place in the division to a wild-card playoff berth.","Yet he also kept things light, masterminding the ""Storm Surge"" postgame celebrations that took the league by storm.","""Just how vocal he is, how he demands a lot out of everybody ... he is not afraid to hurt anybody's feelings,"" forward Jordan Martinook said. ""I think he's figured out a very, very good way, and he's a very good motivator.

His fourth goal in his 151st playoff game was his third winner, and Orpik became just the 11th defenseman in NHL history with two postseason overtime goals.","""I'm probably not counted on for too many goals, but I think if you want to have the long runs, you need everybody kind of chipping in and doing things they don't normally do,"" Orpik said. ""Always feels good when the team comes out on top.""","The Capitals came out on top thanks to Alex Ovechkin's two perfect passes, a 5-on-3 penalty kill and a stick shortage by Carolina that allowed Evgeny Kuznetsov to find Orpik for his goal. Afterward, owner Ted Leonsis quipped, ""Just like it was drawn up.""",There was no way to script the strange happenings that unfolded on and off the ice. Perhaps it was an omen for things to come when the ball used in the Hurricanes' pregame soccer ritual knocked a rat down from the ceiling.,"""I saw that,"" Carolina's Sebastian Aho said. ""First time I've seen it. Kind of odd.""","Then the game happened. Just like Game 1, the Capitals jumped out to an early 2-0 lead — this time on goals by Nicklas Backstrom and T.J. Oshie — but this time the Hurricanes didn't wait until the third period to come back.","Lucas Wallmark scored late in the first after teammate Saku Maenalanen brushed Braden Holtby, which Capitals coach Todd Reirden challenged for goaltender interference. It held up because the NHL situation room and referees determined the contact wasn't significant enough to disallow the goal.","""Playing the position, you know that that's interference,"" said Holtby, who made 25 saves. ""But there's a point in hockey where you've just got to battle, too. I'm not going to complain about a call or no-call. I know that doing that is giving me the best chance to stop that puck. We move on.""","Things only got stranger in the second period. Less than a minute after exiting the penalty box, Hurricanes forward Micheal Ferland hit Nic Dowd while bent over and was given a five-minute match penalty for an illegal check to the head and ejected.","After officials conferred and decided to make it a five-minute major, coach Rod Brind'Amour screamed at referee Steve Kozari that it was a clean hit, pointing to his hip to emphasize Ferland made mostly hip to shoulder contact. Dowd left to go through concussion protocol but returned.","""To be honest with you, I let up,"" said Ferland, who added he doesn't expect to be suspended. ""I could have finished with my shoulder, but I didn't. I came, hit him with my butt. I thought it was a clean hit. I don't agree with the call.""","During the ensuing power play, a one-timer from defenseman John Carlson hit Hurricanes goaltender Petr Mrazek on the right side of his mask and knocked it off. Mrazek winced in pain but did not get pulled for concussion protocol and stayed in the game.","""It caught me a little bit on the chin there,"" said Mrazek, who made 29 saves. ""When I fell, I didn't have the mask on and I hit the ice pretty hard with my face. That was the worst.""","The worst moment for Holtby came when Aho ended a 15-game goal drought by banking the puck off him from a bad angle. Wilson and Jordan Staal traded third-period goals, and Mrazek stopped Carlson in the final seconds of regulation.","That only set the stage for Orpik's heroics. After Hurricanes defenseman Brett Pesce lost his stick and got one from forward Teuvo Teravainen, the Capitals had the opening they needed to take a 2-0 series lead and players mobbed Orpik to celebrate the father figure's clutch goal.","""There's really no better guy to score an OT winner,"" Wilson said. ""We were pumped up, and he deserves it. Huge goal for us.""","NOTES: Ten of the Capitals' last 14 first-round games went to overtime. ... With his 101st playoff point, Backstrom moved ahead of Daniel Alfredsson into sole possession of fourth place among Swedish players. ...

"For Stephane Matteau, a Famous Goal Could Not Cover the Darkness - The New York Times",The tattoo etched across the left side of Stephane Matteau’s torso reminds him of a signature life goal.,"It does not depict his immortal moment 25 years ago this May. There is no image of the Stanley Cup, which he raised two weeks later at Madison Square Garden to celebrate the Rangers’ first championship in 54 years.","As the Rangers’ eternal playoff hero lifts his shirt, he reveals the inked-in words he aspires to: “Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.”","Matteau is wiser and sober at 49. He has battled struggles familiar to the hockey culture he grew up in: mental scars, fear, alcoholism. All of which almost cost him his life.","He had lived every Canadian child’s dream, reaching the N.H.L., playing 13 seasons and being a playoff hero. On May 27, 1994, in the second overtime of Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Devils, Matteau scored perhaps the most significant goal in Rangers history. His name — and Howie Rose’s “Matteau, Matteau, Matteau!” radio call — have a permanent place in New York sports history.","Whenever Matteau returns to the city — as he will Friday, when the Rangers host a reunion of the 1994 Stanley Cup champions — he knows he is part of a venerated alumni group. He still receives effusive gratitude from Rangers fans. Yet his famous goal, which he still calls lucky, does not erase lingering feelings of doubt and career dissatisfaction.","Depression marred his childhood, his hockey career and his retirement. He gave up drinking 17 years ago, but his anxieties and mental struggles were becoming too much to bear. About seven years ago, Matteau realized he was heading toward “a dark and dangerous place” and finally sought counseling.","“I’m humbled, very privileged, I was the chosen one,” he said of his playoff heroics. “I feel blessed to have a lot of good people around me, during good times, and especially the bad ones.”","Matteau was an inconsistent 24-year-old left wing when the Cup-starved Rangers acquired him and Brian Noonan from Chicago at the March 1994 trade deadline, because of the persistence of Coach Mike Keenan.","“Mike was banging on me all season about getting Matteau,” recalled Neil Smith, the general manager at the time, who gave up Tony Amonte, a 33-goal scorer the previous season. “He went to the finals with him in Chicago in ’92. Although we had the best record in the league, Mike felt adamant we’d need size and depth in the playoffs, even if we had to give up our future.”","Matteau was a revelation in the playoffs. He scored six goals, including a double-overtime goal in Game 3 against the Devils, and repeated the feat in Game 7, making him an instant celebrity.","Yet his tenure in New York lasted only a year and a half. He was so unproductive for the Rangers after they won the Cup that Smith traded Matteau to St. Louis. There he was reunited with Keenan, who acquired Matteau four times during his N.H.L. coaching stints.","Keenan said he appreciated the team skills that Matteau brought. “He was a versatile player, a big, strong skater who was the type of player you need in the playoffs,” Keenan said. “We needed him in New York to win the Cup, particularly against New Jersey, with how big they were.","“I pushed him hard, like everyone. I saw he had some self-doubt, but I never once had any doubt about him.”",Matteau could not sustain the confidence his former coach had in him.,"“I was known as a playoff player,” said Matteau, who never scored more than 19 goals a season during his career. “And then I go the next seven years without one goal in the playoffs. Why is that?”","He played in Calgary, Chicago, New York, St. Louis, San Jose and Florida. Much of the baggage Matteau carried to those places was psychological.","His doubt stretched back to a tormented childhood in northwestern Quebec. He grew up in Rouyn (now Rouyn-Noranda), a small middle-class town about 380 miles from Montreal. It has produced 27 N.H.L. players, including stars like Pierre Turgeon and his brother Sylvain, Dave Keon, Réjean Houle and Eric Desjardins.","One of Matteau’s closest friends was Pierre Turgeon. They were born five days apart and were teammates on youth baseball and hockey teams. Turgeon, who went on to score more than 500 goals in a 19-year N.H.L. career, said Matteau was always “selling himself a little short,” despite his prowess as a multisport athlete.","“Even as a pro, Steph used to worry,” Turgeon said. “I remember when he got traded to St. Louis, he was put on a line with me and Brett Hull, which was great. But he says to me, ‘What if I get 20 goals? Everyone will always expect me to do it again.’”","A gangly boy with a bad complexion, Matteau said, he was a frequent target of bullies.","Worse, though, was his father’s relentless criticism. “Whatever I did, it wasn’t good enough,” Matteau said.","Turgeon noticed that Matteau’s father, a mechanic in a car dealership, was “very hard on him.”","“But,” he added, “I don’t think anybody knew what was going on with Steph inside.”","As 12-year-olds, Turgeon and Matteau were the standouts on the Canadian baseball team that went to the 1982 Little League World Series. But Matteau’s self-esteem worsened. Around the time he was 15, Matteau seriously considered suicide. That he did not go through with it made him feel even more cowardly.","“If I could’ve spent my entire youth curled up under a rug,” Matteau said, “I would have.”","He has found new purpose in his sobriety: talking to young people about overcoming despair, relating to their fears and vulnerabilities as authentically as he can.","Almost two years ago, Matteau helped create a leadership program for Bronx elementary and middle school students in partnership with Woodlawn Cemetery. He has visited about 50 schools.","“I struggled with a lot of things the kids go through, being bullied, feeling hopeless,” Matteau said. “I want them to know they can change their own lives.”","Matteau, who lives in Montreal, has also been mentoring at-risk teens at River Rock Academy, an alternative school, in Lancaster, Pa. His wife of 24 years, Nathalie, frequently participates in the Lancaster programs, a reaffirmation of her belief in her husband, who seldom believed in himself.","“What that woman has endured with me,” he said, “it’s a miracle she refused to lose hope.”","Both his children play hockey. His son, Stefan, 25, is a former first-round draft pick of the Devils who now plays for the Vegas Golden Knights’ top affiliate, and his daughter, Alyson, 21, is a senior on the University of Maine women’s hockey team.","Several years ago, Matteau coached a Quebec junior team that his son played on, and things frequently grew tense.","“I was hard on Stef,” Matteau said. “I didn’t want him to make the same mistakes as me.”","His wife interceded, reminding Matteau of the pressure his own father put on him.","On a blustery January day, Matteau visited P.S. 69 in the South Bronx for a session with 20 fifth graders. He is a big man at 6 feet 4 inches and a only few pounds over his playing weight, 220. With casual humor, he easily connected with a multicultural group of children in his French Canadian accent.","Matteau talked to the students about their positive traits, about their relationships with peers and family. The conversations are designed to empower them to be kinder and more empathetic toward one another.",His two-hour program opened with a video of him scoring his famous Game 7 goal against the Devils.,"“I’ve watched this video 10,000 times, and I still get goose bumps,” Matteau told the students. “That was a great, exciting moment for me. But my legacy is more than just scoring one of the most important goals in Rangers history.”"

""These guys did a good job, they came together as a team and played really well over that span and we're in the position we're in because of that.""","Games during that streak resonate to different members of the Blues. Veteran defenseman Jay Bouwmeester remembers the victory at Anaheim before the All-Star break that gave the team a much-needed ""reset."" Armstrong won't soon forget his team's third-period comeback at Florida two games later that kept the good vibrations going into an overtime victory at Tampa Bay and a sweep of a home-and-home series against Nashville.","""We got on a positive roll of winning games and we were playing every other night, so you really start to get into the groove,"" Armstrong said. ""That was a big stretch of games in there where I think the belief was cemented in our minds that I'm not saying we're the best team in the league, but we felt we could compete with the better teams in the league at that point.""","Armstrong said he never came close to pulling the trigger on a major trade that would've shaken up the core, in large part because it was too far away from the deadline to make such a move. That's not exactly a ringing endorsement that he didn't want to make a move but rather an acknowledgement that a fellow GM would've likelier thrown him an anchor than a life preserver.","Finally playing up to expectations allowed the Blues to finish third in the Central Division, and they'll face second-place Winnipeg in the first round.",Bouwmeester considers the Blues underdogs going into the playoffs because they started from the bottom. But now they're here and look more than capable of making a long run.,"""You look over the season just how well we've been able to rally and find a way and crawl back into it, I'm very confident in our group that we can have success,"" O'Reilly said. ""Throughout the season, we beat some great hockey teams we feel we can beat anyone. Going into it, there's definitely a lot of belief, but at the same time it's a lot of hard work that we're looking forward to doing.""",___,___
"The Goalie Is a Hired Gun, and He’s Yours for $50 a Game - The New York Times",TORONTO — Keith Hamilton carried himself like an N.H.L. goaltender even before he made his first save in a pickup game at Moss Park Arena. Standing 6 feet tall — and looking much bigger in skates — he made the net behind him appear to shrink. ,"But this was hardly the N.H.L. Hamilton, 39, was guarding the cage against a team of middle-age men from an Ontario public utility. He wore a replica Colorado Avalanche jersey. Every other player was differentiated by tones more than colors, turning the sessions into light versus dark, a hockey version of shirts and skins.","After an hourlong scrimmage, Hamilton cut a lonely figure as he skated off the ice. There were no handshakes, no fist bumps. He collected the cash he was promised — the going rate is about 50 Canadian dollars per game — changed out of his gear and drove off to the next arena. This was his third game of the day. He had two to go. ","Hamilton is a hockey mercenary, one of the estimated 150 to 200 hired guns in Toronto’s recreation leagues who are in demand as much for their position — goaltender — as  for their skills. With 143 indoor publicly owned arenas in the Toronto metropolitan area, there are many more teams than there are available goalies.","Teams can do without one of their skaters. There are plenty of them. But if the goalie can’t make it, a game could be forfeited, which can feel like a puck to the mouth when ice time costs more than 400 dollars an hour.","“It’s not like soccer, where a player can just go in net,” said Niki Sawni, 27, who runs a goalie-rental service called Puck App.","By various estimates, there are as many as 8,000 rental-goalie orders every year in the Toronto area, which  suggests there is a sizable marketplace for the kind of person willing to play the bull’s-eye in a game of target practice.","“I’ve got a screw loose, sure,” said Mark Philipps, 46, who still tends goal but not so much as a rental goalie anymore. “It takes a special type of person to want to get a puck in the head.”","“You’ll run into some crazy ones,” said John McLeod, 55, a film actor who picks up work as a rental goalie in his off hours. “Very unusual characters, and I worry that I may be one of them, too.”","In Toronto, rental goalies — a cohort of mostly men and a few women — generally range in age from 18 to 65 and come from all walks of life: engineering, acting, education, policing, the trades.",Some even try to make itinerant goaltending their profession. Hamilton is one of those.,"A musician who plays the vibraphone in a six-person folk band called Beams, Hamilton said he makes more money being a rental goalie than playing music in clubs.","He averages 10 games a week and keeps 40 Canadian dollars per game, paying 10 dollars in commission to a rental agency. His cut works out to about 1,600 Canadian dollars, or $1,220 in United States currency, a month. By his estimate, he has made well over 100,000 dollars in eight years as a rental goalie. And, yes, he said, he declares all of his income on his taxes.","“It’s not enough for a mortgage and kids’ education, but it’s just enough to get by,” he said. “There’s certainly more taxing ways to make a living. But I sweat and I come home with bruises.”","The rent-a-goalie concept has been around since at least 1985, when Doug Cardy, a former top junior goalie for the Toronto Marlboros, got tired of people “bugging me” to fill in on teams five or six times a week while he juggled a full-time job.","“I started telling them, ‘I want some money,’” said Cardy, a short-haul trucker. “And I started with a little cardboard sign in one of the arenas with my phone number.”","Cardy set up a business in which his goalies used pagers to check in for work. The money he scratched out wasn’t worth it, though, and Cardy, now 61, got out.","Goalies Unlimited was one of the first agencies to match games with goalies, in the mid-1990s. Since then, online competitors have proliferated, with names like Book a Goalie, MyPuck, Goalies to Go, Puck App, Rent a Goalie and Get a Goalie, which serves Buffalo and Chicago. Most of the agencies are run by current or former goaltenders.","Ian Peters, 44, started his operation in New York after growing tired of paying a $35 Uber fare each way to play goal in pickup games. He made a proposal three years ago to Ron Bursey, 37, who runs the Canadian operation Book a Goalie, and a New York tab was added to the Toronto-based website.","“It started like wildfire and the business blew up,” said Peters, who has about 70 goalies serving New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. “I do it all from my phone. There was resistance in the beginning, because New Yorkers weren’t used to paying for this service.”","Peters charges clients $70 a game, and a goalie gets $25 for his first five bookings and $30 for his next five. A goalie’s pay maxes out at $35."," In Canada, rental agencies tend to take about 15 dollars in commission from the typical rate of $50 a game. Goalies like Hamilton, with eight years experience, can negotiate a lower commission. Sometimes, the business keeps it all. ","Daniel Smith, 57, a former high-level hockey player who became a jockey,   runs Goalies Unlimited. He likes to play four times a week, and as a rental goalie, he collects the full $50 fee each time.","Puck App, which Sawni founded three years ago, markets itself as the Uber of the goalie-rental business. With a smartphone app, it can undercut other services by charging a top rate of 45 dollars in Toronto, and even less in other cities.","Sawni has a database of 8,000 users across Canada, both goalies looking for paid work (about 5,000 so far) and clients looking for help in net.","On Puck App, a team can specify the site, the game’s starting time and the level of play. The offer is sent to all of the goalies in the database who match the criteria.","Patrick Herman, the owner of the MyPuck agency, has a roster of over 300 goaltenders and fills  orders for 15 to 20 games a day. The business can be cutthroat, he said, and he has little time for teams who try to play one service off another to get a better deal.","“If you want a pizza tonight, it’s not like you call Pizza Hut and Domino’s and tell them, ‘The first delivery driver that gets to my door gets my money,’” Herman said.","Some teams try to make side deals with players they like, but the agencies discourage goalies from disclosing their personal contact information to clients."," Occasionally, the client is a fascinating character.","Joe Vercillo, 37,  once got a late request to work for a certain Canadian superstar in the music industry. ","“I got a call around 12:30 at night,” said Vercillo, who is in charge of acquisitions for a small publishing company. “It woke me up. My agent said: ‘Drake has rented the ice. Can you get over in 10 minutes?’”","Vercillo thought it was a prank because no one was inside the arena when he turned up. But soon Drake and his associates arrived, and Vercillo suited up for about 45 minutes of work. ","“They gave me 80 or 100 bucks for that,” Vercillo said."," A representative for another well-known singer-songwriter  called Bursey’s agency in December 2017, requesting two goalies. Justin Bieber wanted to put together a game with some friends at a Toronto arena."," “Bieber had his own entire dressing room,” Bursey said, adding that one of the goalies had told him that by the end of the game, “Teenage girls were all over the rink watching.”"," As at every level of the sport, some goaltenders are better than others. ","Daniel Altshuller, 24, a third-round draft pick of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes in 2012, became a rental goalie last year to stay sharp after taking a season off.","“I had moved to Toronto and I didn’t know anybody,” Altshuller said. “I was just doing it mostly to find somewhere to play hockey.”","Others enter the marketplace for decidedly less professional reasons. Dan Madeiros, a commercial airline pilot, advertises his services at $40 an hour in the online classified forum Kijiji because, he said, he just likes to play.","“I have a job that pays me well,” said Madeiros, 42. “So I look at it that it’s paid exercise.”"
Goalie Alexandar Georgiev Tries to Make the Most of His Chance With the Rangers - The New York Times,"Alexandar Georgiev, an undersized goaltender no team seemed to want, was not supposed to get here.","Yet there he was on Feb. 10 at Madison Square Garden, repeatedly foiling the Toronto Maple Leafs’ shooting barrage. In all, Georgiev, an undrafted rookie, made a career-high 55 saves, carrying the Rangers to a 4-1 victory in a nationally televised game on his 23rd birthday.","It was the second-most saves for a goalie during a regular-season game in franchise history, after Mike Richter’s 59 on Jan. 31, 1991, but Georgiev was not upset with his teammates over all the rubber he faced.","“No. No. No,” Georgiev said in a recent interview. “It was a great day to be a goalie for the New York Rangers. It was fun.”","It has been a season of trying to look on the bright side for the rebuilding Rangers, who were sellers for a second consecutive trade deadline and will miss the playoffs for the second consecutive year. They have received various future assets, including young players and draft picks, and are in the process of evaluating and developing their young core.","After winning the backup goaltender competition in training camp, Georgiev has posted a 12-13-3 record in 30 games, along with a 3.05 goals-against average and a .909 save percentage. Last weekend, he beat the Maple Leafs again, making 44 saves in a 2-1 victory against the league’s second-highest scoring team. On Monday, the Pittsburgh Penguins beat him, 5-2, but on Friday night, he made 44 saves again, in a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues.","He has managed to learn a lot from watching Henrik Lundqvist, the longtime face of the franchise. Backups to Lundqvist rarely play, but lately the two have been sharing time between the pipes. Lundqvist has posted an .895 save percentage since Jan. 1.","“His work ethic is at Hank’s level, but he’s also fast and quick like Hank,” Nick Bobrov, the Rangers’ director of European scouting, said in a reference to Lundqvist. Bobrov is primarily responsible for the Rangers’ eventually landing Georgiev. “He’s got the character and desire to be great.”",Rangers fans have taken notice of Georgiev’s skills.,"While he made the 10-minute walk to the arena before a game from his Midtown Manhattan residence one day, a car stopped in the middle of the street and began beeping at Georgiev. A Rangers fan — who was also going to the game — jumped out of the vehicle, introduced himself, and asked if Georgiev would take a picture with his son.","“I wasn’t startled or anything, but it was a bit unusual,” said Georgiev, who obliged.","Georgiev took a pockmarked path to become the first Bulgarian-born player to reach the N.H.L. At 6-foot-1, he is on the short end for a pro goaltender.","The prevailing stigma is that smaller goalies take up less of the net, and therefore must be lightning quick to prevent pucks from beating them. That left Georgiev on the outside looking in.","“I was really disappointed about not getting drafted, and I wanted to prove people wrong,” he said. “That’s kind of been my career so far, proving to people that I can be more than they expect.”","Georgiev’s parents, Georgi and Natalia, moved to Moscow from Bulgaria when their son was a year old, giving him dual citizenship.","Georgiev began playing hockey when he was 5, but could not quite find his footing as a youngster in Russia. In search of improvement and opportunity, he left to attend a goalie camp in Turku, Finland, run by the former N.H.L. goalie Fredrik Norrena.","Georgiev eventually earned a recommendation to join TPS Turku, a club in the top Finnish league, and continue his development. Still, playing time was hard to come by early on, with older netminders ahead of him on the depth chart.","“I was sitting in the stands every game dreaming about the N.H.L. and feeling like I should be playing,” Georgiev said. “But I realized I had no control over it. So I practiced harder and tried to grind through the season.”","The Rangers’ front office got its first real look at Georgiev during the 2016 world junior championships. He wound up making the Russian team in a tryout camp, beating out Ilya Samsonov, a 2015 first-round pick of the Washington Capitals, for the starting job. He backstopped the team to a silver medal after a 4-3 overtime loss to a Finland team that featured the future N.H.L. stars Patrik Laine and Mikko Rantanen.","Bobrov said he was watching the tournament with the Rangers’ assistant general manager, Chris Drury. “We were saying among ourselves that it’s too bad he’s not bigger, because he’s very good,” Bobrov said.","The Rangers did not draft Georgiev in 2016 or 2017, his breakout season with TPS Turku, during which he led the Finnish Elite League in goals-against average. None of the other N.H.L. teams did, either.",It was not until Drury needed a goalie for the team’s A.H.L. minor league affiliate that Georgiev’s name resurfaced as a possibility.,"“I said we have this kid ‘Georgie’ who we’ve been watching for two to three years now,” Bobrov said. “His size isn’t traditional for the N.H.L., but he’s been proving everyone wrong his entire life, and he’s still doing it. So why don’t we try him? We took a very educated guess that this kid would turn into something special.”","The Rangers invited Georgiev to their developmental camp — and after a daunting excursion to get his United States visa that included an overnight train trip — he earned an entry-level contract with the team on July 18, 2017.","Benefiting from his time working with the goalie coach, Benoit Allaire, Georgiev ascended much more quickly than anticipated, overcoming a slow start in the minors as he transitioned to a smaller North American rink that features different shot angles. He made his N.H.L. debut on Feb. 22, 2018, making 38 saves in a loss at Montreal before picking up his first career win the following night at the Garden.","It remains uncertain whether Georgiev will be the heir apparent for Lundqvist, who turned 37 this month and has two years left on his contract. The Rangers have another highly touted goalie prospect, 23-year-old Igor Shestyorkin, who has excelled in the Kontinental Hockey League in his native Russia. The team is in the process of bringing him to the N.H.L. next season.","Regardless, Georgiev has been in this position before, and his ultimate goal remains the same.","“I want to become a No. 1 goalie eventually,” he said. “And obviously help my team to win the Stanley Cup.”"
"Lightning Ties NHL Record With 62nd Win, Beat Bruins 6-3 - The New York Times","BOSTON — The Tampa Bay Lightning won their NHL record-tying 62nd game, getting a shorthanded goal by Steven Stamkos during a three-goal second period in their 6-3 victory over the Boston Bruins on Saturday in the teams' regular-season finale.","Nikita Kucherov, Anthony Cirelli, Erik Cernak and Braydon Coburn also scored for Tampa Bay (62-16-4), which tied the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings for most victories during the regular season.","Six of the wins, though, came in shootouts.

"For Islanders and Fans, There’s No Place Like Home, or Home - The New York Times","Most N.H.L. teams do not have to look up where they are playing their home games, but such is the transient nature of the Islanders this season.","After 29 games of bouncing between Barclays Center in Brooklyn and Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., the team’s quirky double-home-rink situation comes to an end, for now, after Saturday’s 5-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers in Brooklyn.","The Islanders’ remaining 12 regular-season home games will be at the Coliseum, the franchise’s home from 1972 to 2015. It is close to its practice facility and most players’ homes.","“I never had a problem with Barclays Center, but the Coliseum is just home,’’ Islanders forward Matt Martin said. “They were great to us in Brooklyn, but the Coliseum is where you get that true Islander experience.”","The disjointed season has not affected the team in the standings. After missing the playoffs the past two seasons, the Islanders (35-17-6) are surging under their new coach, Barry Trotz. They lead the Metropolitan Division ahead of the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Washington Capitals, the team Trotz coached last season.","The Islanders announced Friday that the team and its fans may have to make their way back to Brooklyn in the playoffs. Should the Islanders reach the postseason, the first round of home games would be played at Nassau Coliseum, but subsequent rounds would be at Barclays Center because, according to a team statement, “Nassau Coliseum does not qualify as an N.H.L. major league facility.” ","Nassau Coliseum, which was renovated in the team’s absence, is the smallest arena in the N.H.L., with a capacity of about 13,900. Barclays Center, which seats 15,795 for hockey, has 100 suites; the Coliseum has only 11. Maximizing revenue means playing where more premium seats are available.","It remains unclear how long the Islanders will continue to split time between two arenas and, to a degree, two fan bases.","In December 2017, the Islanders, with state officials, announced plans to build a new arena adjacent to Belmont Park Race Course. About a month later, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the team would play about half of its 41 home games at Nassau Coliseum until the new arena opens in 2021. This season, the Islanders will ultimately play 21 games in Uniondale; the N.H.L. is not expected to release next season’s schedule until June.","The Islanders have sold out six of their nine games in Uniondale so far, while Brooklyn games were usually at about 70 percent capacity.","Attendance has suffered since the team moved to Brooklyn in 2015. This season, the Islanders are last in attendance, averaging a little less than 12,000 fans a game. ","But the differences in the two arenas go beyond numbers. Barclays Center, where in 2016 the Islanders won their only playoff series since 1993, was not built with a hockey rink in mind and has unusual sight lines. And most Long Island fans willing to drive to Nassau Coliseum will not often make the trek by train to Brooklyn, though the team’s playing close to Manhattan has attracted some new fans.","“Barclays Center works for me,” said Ed Wiatrak, a longtime season-ticket holder who drives to Brooklyn from Staten Island for almost every game. “The Coliseum winds up costing me more with gas, tolls and parking. But I will go wherever the team is playing.”",The return to the Coliseum has invigorated the fan base with the boisterous charm it had when the Islanders won the Stanley Cup four times in the 1980s. Fans are overjoyed to have the team back. The tradition of driving to Nassau Coliseum to tailgate and commiserate for hours before the opening face-off has been restored.,"“I prayed they would come back to the Nassau Coliseum,” said Annemarie Briskie of Wantagh. “I like the tailgating where everyone is wearing their Islander jerseys and having fun. It feels like family. If Belmont never gets built, so be it. As long as we're here. Brooklyn always felt like a stopgap.”","In this renaissance season, the Islanders have benefited from being home no matter the arena. Heading into Saturday’s game, the Islanders were 6-1-2 this season on Long Island and 12-6-2 at Barclays Center.","Forward Cal Clutterbuck, an Islander since 2013, said the two-arena situation may be working to the team’s advantage.","“It’s a little unusual, but it’s not a negative,’’ he said. “Playing back at the Coliseum is a break from the grind of traveling back and forth to Brooklyn. It’s kind of nice.”","Grace Lee, the wife of Islanders captain Anders Lee, said she relished games at the raucous Coliseum but also liked the city feel of contests in Brooklyn. ","“Brooklyn is so close to our friends in Manhattan, friends from college who come to the games. We have gained fans there,’’ said Lee, who grew up in Chicago and was an All-American lacrosse player at Notre Dame. “And the Coliseum atmosphere is amazing. You feel wanted and loved there. The crowd, the noise, that fan connection is very special.”"
"‘ZooMass’ No More, UMass Crashes the Men’s Frozen Four - The New York Times","AMHERST, Mass. — When Coach Greg Carvel arrived at University of Massachusetts-Amherst from St. Lawrence University in 2016, he inherited a hockey program that had just two winning seasons since 1995 and had won only 11 conference games in Hockey East the previous three seasons.","“We were the joke of Hockey East for a while there,” said Kurt Keats, the only senior on the team who has been in the program for four years. “We definitely were not a source of pride for the university.”","But this season, the Minutemen won their first Hockey East regular-season title and advanced to their first men’s Frozen Four.","They will play eight-time national champion Denver University in the semifinals on Thursday night in Buffalo, with the winner facing the defending champion Minnesota Duluth or Providence in the championship game Saturday night.","Almost from the moment he arrived on campus, Carvel, who on Tuesday was named the national coach of the year, promised a change in culture and fortune for a program that was often overshadowed by in-state rival UMass-Lowell, announcing, “We’re not ZooMass, we’re NewMass.”","Still, in his first season, UMass had only five victories and lost its last 17 games. Last year UMass finished 17-20-2, but did win its first-round series in the Hockey East playoffs.","Signs of a breakthrough came early this season. The Minutemen won at Ohio State, ranked No. 1 at the time, in its second game, then rode a nine-game winning streak to the top spot, sweeping No. 4 Providence along the way. They are ranked fourth in the most recent poll, and are the only Division I men’s team that did not lose consecutive games this season.","UMass takes a 30-9-0 record to the Frozen Four, but after earning its berth in Buffalo, even Carvel admitted, “We’re way ahead of schedule.”","The Minutemen produced this surprising season with one of the youngest rosters in college hockey. Of its 25 skaters, 19 are freshmen and sophomores, including the first-year Finnish goalie Filip Lindberg.","Lindberg took over the starting job from the sophomore Matt Murray, who had won 20 games, in the Hockey East quarterfinals sweep against New Hampshire and has posted three shutouts since. In the N.C.A.A. East Regional, UMass outscored Harvard and Notre Dame by a combined 8-0.","The team’s marquee player, though, is the sophomore defenseman Cale Makar, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2017 N.H.L. draft. He is expected to join the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup playoffs as soon as his college season ends.","Along with St. Cloud State’s Jimmy Schuldt and Harvard’s Adam Fox, also defensemen, Makar is a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the most outstanding player in college hockey. The winner will be announced on Saturday.","Carvel left no doubt on how he thinks the vote should go, saying last week of Makar: “He’s the best player in college hockey. It’s not even close.”","According to Brian Willsie, the development consultant for the Avalanche, Makar has all the qualities necessary for success in the N.H.L.","“To say he’s a mobile defenseman is an understatement,” Willsie said. “His skating is what blows you away. It’s on a different level.”","With 16 goals and 32 assists, Makar, a native of Calgary, Alberta, is tied for third in the nation in scoring. With three points in Buffalo, he would become the first defenseman to lead the nation in points.","“In tight games, in the third periods, he knows how to win games,” Willsie said. “He’s such a driven, focused kid.”","Northeastern Coach Jim Madigan has seen enough of Makar the last two seasons to say, “ He has all the makings of a 15-year pro.”","Makar anchors a defense that is UMass’ strength. Not only are the Minutemen sixth in the country in goals against average (1.97), but their defensemen have accounted for 39 goals and 87 assists, powering an offense that is third in the country at 3.77 goals per game.",Forward Brett Boeing said UMass’s aggressive style starts with its defense.,"“We want to force turnovers and then control the play,” he said. “When we’re playing well, you can see the frustration on the other team.”","Carvel, 48, was not thinking about immediately reaching Frozen Fours when he took over the program in 2016.","UMass had been a Division II program when it dropped men’s hockey in 1979. The sport didn’t return to Amherst until the 8,389-seat Mullins Center opened in 1993. After one year as an independent, when it won 20 games, UMass joined Hockey East for the 1994-95 season. UMass received an at-large bid to its first N.C.A.A tournament in 2007, losing to Maine in the quarterfinals.","Despite losing records in all but two of its Division I seasons before this one, the Minutemen have produced N.H.L. players, among them goalie Jonathan Quick and forward Conor Sheary, who have won Stanley Cups.",Carvel’s first objective was to identify the right players to take the team forward.,"Keats, who played 35 games as a freshman, was one of those players under the microscope.","“When he came in, we knew he wanted to weed guys out,” Keats said.","That first season, Keats said, players bought in to Carvel’s message, “but we didn’t see the results.”","For the 2017-18 season, Carvel brought in 13 freshmen, including Makar and fellow defenseman Mario Ferraro, the No. 49 overall pick by the San Jose Sharks in 2017. A different attitude arrived with them.","“You could see something starting to develop,” Keats said.","In a season of few regrets, Carvel said he wished success had come earlier for players like Keats and Boeing, who were around when the program was floundering.","“I think they’re a little wistful about that, how success came late in their time at UMass,” he said. “But they will always carry that they were part of the group that turned this program around.”"
"John Tavares, Returning as an Enemy, Faces the Wrath of Islanders Fans - The New York Times","John Tavares knew that things would not be easy for him Thursday night, when he made his first visit to the Islanders since leaving them to become a Toronto Maple Leaf.","Many Islanders fans, emotionally bruised by the departure of Tavares, the longtime team captain, had vowed to vent their anguish at Nassau Coliseum, expressing disgust over his decision last summer to sign as a free agent with Toronto, his hometown team.","They followed through. Outside the arena before the opening face-off, several people burned No. 91 Tavares sweaters on grills or in trash cans. Others wore Tavares’s old Islanders sweater but replaced his name with “Traitor.”","When Toronto took the ice for warm-ups, Tavares was greeted by a chorus of boos. Fans pressed against the glass on the visitors side of the rink chanting, “We don’t need you.”","The Islanders — after surrendering the first goal — demolished the Maple Leafs, 6-1, and the acerbic chants only grew louder as Tavares was held pointless. The Islanders also won the first meeting between the teams, 4-0, in Toronto on Dec. 29.","“I’m just trying to play hockey. So for everyone else, I can’t speak for them,” Tavares said after the game. “They have their feelings and it’s out of my control.”","Tavares, 28, who became the face of the Islanders after they chose him first over all in the 2009 draft, expected this kind of greeting. It was inevitable that he would be cast as the villain in an arena where he long generated cheers.","During his time on Long Island, Tavares was active in the community, visiting schools and hospitals every season. He played hard for lackluster Islanders squads, making the playoffs only three times in nine seasons.","Tavares also worked to assimilate with a seemingly ever-changing cast of linemates and watched as close friends like Matt Moulson and Ryan Strome were traded by Garth Snow, the general manager from 2006 to 2018.","Tavares was playing under a team-friendly, six-year, $33 million contract before last summer, when he became an unrestricted free agent for the first time.","The Islanders could have asked Tavares to waive his no-trade clause at last year’s trade deadline to give the franchise a chance to recoup assets for him, its best player. But management and ownership chose to keep Tavares and let him reach the open market. Six teams, including the Islanders, met with Tavares before he decided to leave.","He had been the foundation of the franchise for so long, it was hard to imagine a future without him. A long-term commitment to the Islanders seemed implicit in December 2017, when Tavares was present at Belmont Park as the Islanders announced plans for their future arena on the racetrack grounds.","Tavares, who is soft-spoken, also frequently said last season that he hoped to stay with the Islanders. But he was ultimately swayed by the opportunity to return home, signing with the Maple Leafs for seven years and $77 million.","“It was a tough pill to swallow for everyone,” Anders Lee, the captain of the Islanders this season, said recently. “As teammates, we wanted him on our team. Fans wanted the same thing.”","Tavares is second in scoring for the Leafs, who are strong contenders from the Atlantic Division. He has 36 goals and 32 assists through 64 games; his career high for goals in a season is 38 in 2014-15.","Without Tavares, the Islanders have become the surprise of the N.H.L. They lead the Metropolitan Division under Barry Trotz, their new coach, and are almost surely heading to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.","But on Thursday, cheering for one of the best Islanders teams in years was not enough for many of the home fans.","Midway through the first period, the Islanders presented a video tribute to Tavares, similar to others that have accompanied a star player’s return to his former city. When Mark Messier came back to New York after signing with Vancouver in the summer of 1997, he was reduced to tears as images of him appeared above the Garden ice.","This time, the arena filled with boos and profanity, drowning out any audio from the tribute. Players from both teams watched and tapped their sticks. Tavares clapped his blue Maple Leafs gloves together several times before play resumed.","“It was nice to give my appreciation for nine years here for everyone who supported me,” Tavares said.",The former Islanders forward Colin McDonald was Tavares’s roommate on Long Island for two-plus seasons starting in 2013. Each attended the other’s weddings in recent summers and remain close friends. McDonald said recently that he knew Tavares’s personality would help him endure any vitriol.,"“John invested everything he had into that organization,” said McDonald, 34, now captain of the Lehigh Valley Phantoms in the American Hockey League. “He is human, and of course that’s not the reaction he’s looking for. But as far as learning to deal with stuff you can’t control, I have never met someone who can handle it like John.”","Tavares spoke often of how he relished playing in front of the boisterous crowds at Nassau Coliseum. The cozy arena shook in April 2015 when Tavares scored an overtime winner in the playoffs against the Washington Capitals, just as it did countless other times for the star center who had 272 goals as an Islander.","“I loved my time as an Islander,” Tavares said in early February, when the Leafs played the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. “Now I love being a Maple Leaf. It was the right fit for me. It was still the hardest decision I have ever made.”"

Trading Places: NHL Deadline Deals' Effect on Playoff Teams - The New York Times,Excuse Derick Brassard for having a little difficulty finding his bearings after the veteran center took an unorthodox cross-country route in reaching the NHL playoffs.,"Starting the season with Pittsburgh, Brassard was traded to Florida and spent 10 games with the Panthers before landing in Colorado in time to help the Avalanche's late-season surge to clinch the Western Conference's eighth and final playoff berth. Brassard is also re-adjusting to center after playing on the wing in Florida.","""It's been kind of a weird season for me personally. By coming here, I had to try to adjust quickly,"" Brassard said Monday as Colorado prepares for a first-round matchup against Calgary. ""I feel like I'm fitting in really well. I wish I could chip in a little more. I think it's been three or four games, since I'm back to my normal position.""","Brassard, who has four goals in 20 games for Colorado, was one of 32 players involved in 20 deals struck at the NHL trade deadline on Feb. 25.",Brassard's acquisition — Colorado gave up a third-round draft pick — wasn't the most notable of the day. And yet it was a reflection of numerous teams' approach to addressing needs before making a final playoff push and beyond.,"The Winnipeg Jets led the way in completing six trades, including acquiring veteran center Kevin Hayes from the New York Rangers. Central Division rival Nashville responded by acquiring forwards Mikael Granlund from Minnesota and Wayne Simmonds from Philadelphia. Vegas struck what was the most impressive deal by landing forward Mark Stone in a multiplayer trade with Ottawa.","The trades don't include various deals struck in the days leading up to the deadline, such as Columbus' addition of Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel in separate swaps with Ottawa.","And while other teams were wheeling and dealing, teams such as Presidents' Trophy-winning Tampa Bay elected to stand pat. The Lightning roster was already deep and talented at all positions.","""Well, I think if I was as the GM in Tampa, I'd probably stand pat, too,"" former NHL executive turned broadcaster Brian Burke said. ""They're the class of the league this year.""","In the end, Burke wondered how many of the trades will truly make the difference in determining the Stanley Cup champion.","""The trade deadline, so many mistakes are made,"" Burke said. ""(You have) 15 teams making moves at the deadline, and there's (only) one parade.""","Of the 16 playoff teams, only two — Pittsburgh and Colorado — were sitting outside the top eight spots in the conference standings on Feb. 25. Montreal dropped out in the East and Minnesota in the West.","The Jets' additions failed to push them ahead of the Predators in the race for the Central title, though they were enough to keep Winnipeg ahead of the late-charging S. Louis Blues. Winnipeg was a point behind Nashville on Feb. 25 and finished the season in the same position.","Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff, however, believes his team is better prepared in opening the playoffs against St. Louis.","""They've meshed in,"" Cheveldayoff said of the newcomers.","""They've gone through the newness process,"" he added. ""That's over. They're just like every one of us now.""","In Nashville, the Predators believe they added leadership to the locker room and more of a hard-hitting presence on the ice in preparing to open against Dallas.","""Just seeing who we match up against in the playoffs, it's those heavier teams, bigger bodies and having guys up front who can handle the bigger D,"" defenseman Ryan Ellis said. ""The moves we made made our team better.""","In Columbus, the Blue Jackets went all in by adding to their roster rather than subtracting players such as goalie Sergei Bobrovsky and forward Artemi Panarin — both eligible to become unrestricted free agents this summer. Panarin led the team with 87 points, while Bobrovsky closed the season by going 10-3, including four shutouts.","Add in the likes of Duchene, Dzingel and defenseman Adam McQuaid, and the Blue Jackets believe they have the depth for a daunting first-round matchup against Tampa Bay.","""They've been through the trenches with us.

No Canada: Nation's Stanley Cup Drought Approaches 26 Years - The New York Times,"Whenever Eric Desjardins reunites with his 1993 Montreal Canadiens teammates, the topic of Canada's ongoing Stanley Cup drought doesn't come up in conversation.","""We don't see it that way. Canadian team, American team, it's just that we were part of the NHL,"" the former star defenseman said. ""Sure, it's been a while in Montreal, but we don't really talk about the 26 years.""","That's right. With the NHL playoffs set to open Wednesday, it will be going on 26 years since the Canadiens — or any other Canadian team — brought home the Cup.","Desjardins, who enjoyed a 17-year career split between Montreal and Philadelphia, chalks up the drought to NHL expansion across the United States and league-wide parity ushered in with the introduction of the salary cap in 2005.","""It's supposed to be our national sport, and we're supposed to be the best at it,"" said Desjardins, who's from Montreal. ""But now, the way the league's structured I think it could go anywhere. ... I think anybody can win it now. And I think it makes it more interesting.""","Still, the 49-year-old acknowledged a quarter century between Cups in Canada is far too long, and Desjardins can see himself rooting for any Canadian team making it to this year's Final.","""If the Final's between Pittsburgh and Winnipeg, yeah I would root, even though I like Pittsburgh,"" he said. ""But yeah, against Calgary, Winnipeg, I would cheer for the Canadian team.""","Canada's Cup hopes this spring rest on three teams — Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto — to end the drought. Of course, most current Canadian-born NHL players weren't alive to see Desjardins and Co. celebrate their five-game series win over the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings.",Sabres forward Jason Pominville is among the exceptions.,"He was 10 when his hometown Habs won, and Pominville still vividly recalls Game 2 of the series in which Desjardins scored all three goals in Montreal's 3-2 overtime win after the Canadiens lost the opener.","""I remember watching that and celebrating in my living room, and fist-pumping when he scored,"" Pominville said. ""I was a big fan of Gretzky, too. But when you're in Montreal, it's tough not to root for that team when you're growing up.""","In Montreal, there was a time when winning the Cup was considered a birthright. The Canadiens still top the list with 24 championships, 23 coming after the NHL was founded in 1917.","And yet, Montreal hasn't reached the Final since '93, while only five Canadian teams have done so; Vancouver is the only one to make two appearances during the drought, in 1994 and 2011.","Then there are the Maple Leafs, who haven't reached the Final since winning the Cup in 1967, the last year of the NHL's Original Six era.","The low point might have been the 2016 playoffs, the first since 1970 to not feature a Canadian team","This was not always the case. From 1927 to 1995, the lengthiest stretch for a Canadian team not appearing in the Final was two years. It last happened in 1991-92, when Pittsburgh won consecutive championships by beating Minnesota and Chicago.","As for Canada's lengthiest Cup drought before the '93 Habs, it was a six-year span from 1936-41.","The current drought has gone on for so long, former executive-turned broadcaster Brian Burke said the math simply doesn't add up.","""It doesn't make sense.

Islanders Finish Off Penguins 3-1 for Stunning Playoff Sweep - The New York Times,PITTSBURGH — Barry Trotz had questions when he took over the New York Islanders last summer. About the defense. About the goaltending. About where the scoring would come from if star John Tavares bailed in free agency.,"One by one over the last 10 months, the Islanders have answered them all. The team that couldn't stop anyone a year ago is now the team that stops nearly everyone — Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins included.","Four games. Four wins, each one more impressive than the next, culminating in a typically gritty 3-1 victory in Game 4 on Tuesday night that finished off a stunning sweep of the Penguins and sent the Islanders into the second round of the playoffs for just the second time in 26 years.","""It's not like we came in and thought we were going to win it in four games,"" said New York goaltender Robin Lehner, who stopped 135 of the 141 shots he faced in the series, including 32 of 33 in the clincher. ""But we felt confident coming in playing against these guys. We really did.""","The Islanders trailed for less than five minutes across four games, responding every time Pittsburgh made a push. When Penguins forward Jake Guentzel scored 35 seconds into the first period to give Pittsburgh an early jolt, Eberle responded 1:34 later to tie the game. The Islanders never trailed again, taking the lead for good on Brock Nelson's third of the playoffs late in the first period. Josh Bailey flipped in an empty-netter with 38 seconds to go in the third.","""It's kind of been the staple,"" said Eberle, who had four goals in four games. ""They score and we're able to respond in a timely fashion. Just a lot of commitment at the end of the game, some blocks, some huge sticks preventing and a big kill. That's the Islander way to win.""",New York will face either Washington or Carolina in the second round. Trotz led the Capitals to the franchise's first Stanley Cup last spring but downplayed the idea of a rematch. At least for now.,"""That's a special group that will always be a part of me,"" Trotz said. ""But if we end up playing them, they're the opposition.""",Pittsburgh began the playoffs looking for the franchise's third Stanley Cup in four years. The Penguins managed just six goals while getting swept in the opening round for the first time since 1972.,"""It's a tough loss for us, but we have to learn,"" Pittsburgh forward Evgeni Malkin said. ""Next year, we need to understand there are young guys, they're hungry. Every team tries to win. We're not champions anymore.""",The Islanders hired Trotz last summer just days after he lifted the Cup with the Caps. He immediately began a makeover that put a premium on preventing goals rather than scoring them. New York signed Lehner to a one-year deal in the early days of free agency.,"The 27-year-old used it as a chance to jump-start his career, teaming with Thomas Greiss to serve as the backbone of a club that allowed the fewest goals in the league during the regular season. Lehner then backed it up with 12-plus periods of sound hockey that left Pittsburgh baffled.","Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist's frustration briefly bubbled over in the second period. Tired of getting whacked at by Lehner, the fiery Swede started a shoving match that flirted with turning into a full-blown fight. While it briefly gave Pittsburgh a spark, it didn't translate to the scoreboard. Not much did for the Penguins, whose 13th straight playoff appearance lasted all of seven days.","""It boils down to critical moments, making the right plays at the right time,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""We didn't play as well as we're capable.""","New York's system that forced the Penguins to go through layer upon layer of players certainly helped. The Islanders' forecheck flustered Pittsburgh early in the series, and the Penguins never really got comfortable.","""They're a team that's built on defense first and they've certainly bought into that and that's their identity,"" Sullivan said of the Islanders. ""I think our identity is different based on the personnel that we have. Having said that, it's hard to win in the playoffs when you don't defend and you don't take care of the puck.""","That problem popped up once again in the decider. Shortly after Guenztel's goal brought the 574th consecutive home sellout to its feet, Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang tried to pinch at the blue line to keep the puck in the New York zone. The puck hopped over his stick and went to Eberle, who finished off a 2-on-1 by ripping a shot by Murray's glove.","Just like that, the Islanders had the momentum again. And just like in Games 1-3, they didn't give it back.","A little bit of puck luck helped. Crosby hit the inside of the left post in the middle of the second period, and Islanders defenseman Scott Mayfield bailed out Lehner by making a save with his left leg on a point-blank shot by Phil Kessel early in the third.","And that was it. When Bailey's flip went the length of the ice and into the empty net, the Islanders' bench erupted and the Penguins trudged toward an offseason that could lead to significant changes.",NOTES: New York F Cal Clutterbuck and D Johnny Boychuck both left in the second period with injuries and did not return. ... Crosby's assist on Guentzel's goal moved him past Hall of Famer Steve Yzerman and into 10th place on the NHL's all-time playoff points list (186). ... Pittsburgh went 0 for 3 on the power play and finished 1 for 11 in the series with the man advantage.,UP NEXT,The Islanders face the winner of the series between the defending Stanley Cup champion Capitals and the Carolina Hurricanes.

Sid for Selke? Crosby's Versatile Game Expanding for Pens - The New York Times,"PITTSBURGH — Casey DeSmith has seen it at every stop of his hockey career. Practice comes, the focus shifts to defending and the guys paid lavishly to score goals take their foot off the gas.","""I've had people on every single team I've ever played on like that, obviously,"" the Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender said. ""It just comes with the territory of being a gifted offensive player.""","There is an exception. Then again, there almost always is when it comes to Sidney Crosby.","The Penguins captain — whose resume is stuffed with six 100-point seasons, a pair of scoring titles and two Hart Trophies as the NHL's Most Valuable Player — has long been respected and feared for his creative playmaking.","It's his leadership and conscientious approach to every aspect of the game while stewarding the Penguins through a rocky season to a 13th straight playoff berth that has put the 31-year-old into the conversation for the Selke Trophy, given annually to the NHL's top defensive forward.",Both the metrics and the eye test heading into Pittsburgh's first-round matchup with the New York Islanders provide a compelling case.,"Crosby won more than 55% of his faceoffs this season, his best mark since 2009-10. He blocked 43 shots and took away the puck from an opponent 54 times, the second-highest total of his career. After a talk with coach Mike Sullivan last fall, Crosby occasionally found himself killing penalties, a role he embraced and would have happily kept doing if not for concerns over his workload.","Still, there are situations when Sullivan knows he needs the star he calls ""the best 200-foot player in the game"" to go do his thing. Nursing a one-goal lead late against Carolina on March 31, Sullivan sent Crosby over the boards over and over and over as the clock dwindled. Pittsburgh held the Hurricanes at bay and emerged with a crucial 3-1 win.","""He was out there three of the last five minutes, defending the six-on-five, defending the five-on-four,"" Sullivan said. ""He was the one guy that was dominant in the faceoff circle. I thought his defensive effort was on display.""","Hall of Famer Sergei Fedorov was the last player to capture the Selke while scoring 100 points, doing it for Detroit in 1996. Crosby has an outside shot at joining that exclusive company when the league awards are announced in June. Not that Crosby, who has never finished higher than seventh in Selke voting, seems to care.","""I'm still trying to figure it out, to be honest with you,"" Crosby said. ""I think it's still something, you're trying to ingrain those habits and be in the right positions. I think experience helps that. You realize that it can help you offensively to be good defensively too. It's not as bad as sometimes you think it needs to be. I think that's part of it.""",Or maybe more than a part of it.,"Pittsburgh center Matt Cullen, at 42 the league's oldest player, has carved out a 21-year career due in large part to his defensive expertise. Around the time he hit 30, Cullen knew he needed to find different ways to contribute beyond trying to put the puck in the net if he wanted to stick around. He sees Crosby taking some of the same steps not out of necessity but by choice, which makes it all the more impressive.","""I think Sid's the best example of a guy that has that growth mindset as far as he's never completely satisfied with where he's at,"" Cullen said. ""He's always evolving and learning and adapting to different situations.""","Cullen likened Crosby to Michael Jordan, who was named to the NBA's All-Defensive team nine times in addition to winning 10 scoring titles and leading the Chicago Bulls to six championships.","""Sid's accepted all the challenges of playing against the top lines and then going out and scoring, too,"" Cullen said.","Forward Jared McCann arrived in a trade with Florida on Feb. 1. The 22-year-old grew up admiring Crosby from afar. The up-close look has been even more revealing. McCann will find himself transfixed on Crosby's No. 87 during film sessions, studying the subtle aspects of Crosby's play in Pittsburgh's end looking for tips that might translate to his own game, be it positioning, physicality or a sense on knowing where the puck is headed before it gets there.","""I kind of catch myself moving a little bit too much, kind of circling too much,"" McCann said. ""I see him stop his feet and then read the play, see where it's going to go and then go. I feel like as a young player, as much as you can watch him in the defensive zone, you should learn from him.""","Coach Peter Laviolette has spent more than a decade trying to find ways to deal with Crosby during stops in Carolina, Philadelphia and now Nashville, with only occasional success.","""Never once did it cross my mind to think maybe we could put somebody on the ice and take advantage of him,"" Laviolette said. ""It's just that I think his offense overshadows (his defense) sometimes because he's an elite offensive player.""",Which Sullivan believes separates Crosby from annual Selke contenders like Boston's Patrice Bergeron and Los Angeles' Anze Kopitar.,"""He's the most dangerous guy with the puck,"" Sullivan said. ""He also has the ability to score goals at the other end of the rink in quick strike better than any of the other players in conversation.""","Opportunities that typically begin with Crosby in the defensive zone, doing the dirty work others won't in an effort to produce the highlights few can.","""His ability to win faceoffs, his puck protection, his strength on the puck, his ability to control the game, all of those things, as important as they are on the offensive side of the puck, they're just as important on the defensive side,"" Predators defenseman PK Subban said.","""When he decides, he's going to come back into the zone, get the puck and take it out of the zone, he's going to do it.""",___
IIHF Offers Explanation for Call That Cost Finland Gold - The New York Times,"ESPOO, Finland — The International Ice Hockey Federation offered an explanation Monday for the decision to waive off what would have been the gold medal-winning goal by Finland in the host country's shootout loss to the United States in the women's world hockey championship game.","The IIHF, which had a video judge review every goal during the tournament, cited two rules in saying the goal by Petra Nieminen at 11:33 of overtime was disallowed due to non-incidental goaltender interference.",Nieminen's goal sparked a wild celebration on Sunday as jubilant fans cheered what would have been Finland's first championship in its first appearance in the title game.,"After a lengthy video review, the goal was called back.","Finland captain Jenni Hiirikoski had made contact with American goaltender Alex Rigsby, who was moving out of her crease, as she passed in front of the net. Hiirikoski wasn't assessed a goaltender interference penalty, but Rigsby was given a tripping minor.",The IIHF said the video judge weighed two rules in making the decision to waive off the goal.,"One states: ""An attacking skater who makes contact other than incidental with a goaltender who is out of his goal crease during game action will be assessed a minor penalty for interference. If a goal is scored at this time, it will not count."" The other states: ""Incidental contact is allowed when the goaltender is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease, provided the attacking skater makes a reasonable effort to minimize or avoid such contact.""","Once the goal was waived off, the referees decided to uphold the tripping penalty. The Americans killed off two penalties in overtime before winning the game in a shootout as dispirited fans watched their devastated team await their runner-up honors.",Finnish Ice Hockey Federation chief executive officer Matti Nurminen said referees planned to give a penalty to Rigsby for tripping and were allowing the goal.,"""But when it goes to video review, the power and authority goes (to) the video-goal judges,"" he said after the game.

I was trying to ask the ref how I got a penalty, considering I was the one who got body-slammed. But the ref thinks I tried tripping the player when I was on the ground, and somehow I end up with the penalty. Funny how that went.""",Finland coach Pasi Mustonen said the play was simple: it was either a penalty on Hiirikoski for goalie interference and no goal or a penalty on Rigsby and a goal by Nieminen. He said he received no explanation from officials about the decision.,"""They never come to me. They are ordered not to talk,"" Mustonen said after the game. ""They never can communicate, which means they destroy the atmosphere between the referees and the teams. They don't really have the self-confidence that is needed to communicate with people in this atmosphere and that is the problem, which is also a matter of competence. We need male referees. All the female referees that are mature enough to be here, naturally, they should be here, but there are so few in the world.""","In Toronto, Finnish forward Kasperi Kapanen of the Maple Leafs said the call was botched.","""I think they kind of messed it up ... that's what happens. It is what it is,"" he told The Canadian Press. ""It would have been nice for them to win. It would have been good for women's hockey, and just our country in general.""",Kapanen wasn't the only one confused by the call.,"Former American women's team captain Julie Chu tweeted, ""What is going onnnnn?

Alexis Lafrenière Would Rather You Didn’t Compare Him to Sidney Crosby - The New York Times,"RIMOUSKI, Quebec — The walls inside Sun Life Financial Coliseum in this eastern Quebec town along the Saint Lawrence River are swathed in tributes to the history of the Rimouski Oceanic, which entered the competitive ranks of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1995.","There are homages to former players like Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards, who in 2000 led the club to its only Memorial Cup, Canadian junior hockey’s ultimate prize. Naturally, there is plenty of space dedicated to Sidney Crosby, the superstar who played two seasons in Rimouski.",There’s a new player causing a stir among the locals — 17-year-old Alexis Lafrenière — and he will not even be eligible for the N.H.L. draft until 2020.,"With a remarkable season and a standout international career, Lafrenière has been drawing comparisons to Crosby, whose talent belied his age 15 years ago before being drafted first over all by the Pittsburgh Penguins.","A native of Saint Eustache, Quebec, a suburb just west of Montreal, Lafrenière dismisses such comparisons. But in a proud province whose die-hard hockey fans have waited some time for the next French Canadian superstar, he has been forced to contend with some lofty expectations.","“He played in Rimouski, and I did too. That’s something people say,” Lafrenière said. “But I’m not Crosby. I just try to be myself and play my game. If I can watch Crosby play and do things like he do, for sure I will do it to try to get better, but I don’t think I’m Crosby.”","Like Crosby, Lafrenière was selected first over all by Rimouski in the Q.M.J.H.L. draft. And like Crosby, Lafrenière dominated the league at 16, being named the league’s top rookie last season as well as a first-team All-Star. His 42 goals last season were the most for a 16-year-old in the league since Crosby in 2003-4.","In February, Lafrenière went on a 12-game tear in which he collected eight goals and 23 points, the highest single-month point total in his junior hockey career. He finished the regular season last weekend with 105 points, tied for second in the league, behind only Rouyn-Noranda forward Peter Abbandonato, a player almost three and a half years Lafrenière’s senior.","“We haven’t felt this kind of response since Sidney,” the Oceanic owner Alex Tanguay said. “It’s a different kind of response, obviously with the social media and stuff, but you can definitely feel a vibe around him. Back then, if you wanted to see Sid play, you needed to drive down to Rimouski.","“Now in 2019, you can know what type of player Alexis is just by watching him on the internet or on TV. I guess it’s a different kind of response, but in a way the same vibe we felt almost 15 years ago.”","Any dominant 16-year-old hockey player naturally draws comparisons to Crosby, one of Canada’s most fabled native sons. But Lafrenière’s dominance has not been confined to the league colloquially known as the Q.","At the 2018 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup, the top international tournament for players 17 and younger, Lafrenière tied for the scoring lead despite being the second-youngest player on his team. He sealed Canada’s tournament victory with two goals, including the winner, in the final against Sweden.","In December and January, he was the youngest player to compete at the International Ice Hockey Federation world junior championship, for players 20 and younger. In part because of injuries to other players, Lafrenière became the ninth youngest to compete for Canada at the annual holiday tournament, behind names like Wayne Gretzky, Connor McDavid, Eric Lindros and, of course, Crosby.","But Lafrenière’s world junior showcase was not exactly a grand coronation. Canada, the host nation, lost in the quarterfinal to Finland, the eventual champion. After a third-period benching against Switzerland in group play, Lafrenière encountered the first real adversity of his young career. He responded with a goal against the Czech Republic in the next game.","“This goal was probably one of the biggest of my career in front of so much people,” he said. “At World Juniors, scoring a goal is really special.”","The Rimouski coach and general manager, Serge Beausoleil, added: “In many ways, it helped him. It’s one of the first times that he faced adversity. He has to react to that. That’s really good for him. He’s a tremendous player, but he has room for improvement.”","Aside from their biographical similarities, Lafrenière and Crosby differ drastically in style. Whereas Crosby’s legend was built on subtlety and the facility with which he makes the extraordinary appear ordinary, Lafrenière is more the showman. He appears most in his element driving offensive play with the puck on his stick. It’s a style he adopted as a child emulating his favorite player, the Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane.","A fastidious student of the game, Lafrenière can still describe a personal favorite pass from Kane to then-teammate Marian Hossa.","“The pass to Hossa,” he recalled. “He spin around and back door. That was pretty sick.”","Lafrenière is expected to be a prominent player in next season’s world junior tournament in the Czech Republic. By then, every game he plays will draw the kind of scrutiny reserved for a player expected to go No. 1 in the N.H.L. draft.","The last Quebecois player selected first over all was goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in 2003. The last nongoalie from Quebec to go first was Lecavalier in 1998. That’s a startling drought for a province known as the proving ground for icons like Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau, Gilbert Perreault, Guy Lafleur, Mario Lemieux, Ray Bourque and Patrick Roy.",Lafrenière would be thrilled to bring Quebec back to the top of the N.H.L. draft board.,"“Just to be drafted is a dream,” he said. “If I had the chance to go first over all, that would be something really special.”","But with plenty of hockey to play before the 2020 N.H.L. draft, Rimouski’s lively fans are looking forward to a few more indelible moments with their young superstar. Lafrenière’s agent announced in February that he would return to the Oceanic for the 2019-20 season after reports that he had been approached by professional clubs in Europe.","“He’s our best player at 17 years old,” Beausoleil said. “At times, we’re really demanding because we love him. It’s good to see that he has something to learn. That’s a long process.”"
The Best Maple Leafs Forward Might Not Be Who You Think He Is - The New York Times,"TORONTO — The Maple Leafs superstars John Tavares and Auston Matthews have been as good as advertised this season, and often even better.","But Mitch Marner, who came to this championship-starved city with high expectations after he was chosen with the No. 4 overall pick in 2015, has had a breakout year and made a case that he’s the most valuable Maple Leafs forward.","Marner, a 21-year-old winger, led Toronto in points this season and became the youngest player in Maple Leafs history to record 90 points, the first to hit that benchmark in 22 years.","Marner finished 11th in the N.H.L. with 94 points (26 goals and 68 assists), six points ahead of Tavares and 21 ahead of Matthews, who missed 14 games because of injury. Marner and Tavares play on the same line, and Marner was a key reason Tavares, in his first season in Toronto, had a career-high 47 goals this season.",[N.H.L. playoffs: first-round schedule and results],"Tavares, Matthews and Marner, along with goaltender Frederik Andersen, will need to be at their best as the Maple Leafs seek postseason redemption against the Boston Bruins, their first-round opponent for the second straight season. Their best-of-seven series starts Thursday in Boston.","The wounds remain fresh from last spring’s opening round, when Toronto coughed up a 4-3 second-period lead and lost, 7-4, in a shocking conclusion to Game 7.","But last season the Leafs didn’t have Tavares, the longtime Islanders star. His signing to a seven-year, $77 million contract as a free agent last summer created hope in a city long accustomed to hockey failure. The Leafs haven’t won the Stanley Cup since 1967 and haven’t won a playoff series since 2004.","Although Marner can’t match Tavares or Matthews in goal-scoring ability, he has wowed everyone with his vision.","“The one thing about Marner,” Tampa Bay Lightning Coach Jon Cooper said, “is he is as smart a player as this league has not only seen this year, but has ever seen.”","Marner attributes his creativity to playing multiple sports as a youth. Soccer helped develop his footwork, and lacrosse was important in developing his hands and mobility around the goal area.","“Both soccer and lacrosse are creative in their own ways,” Marner said. “In soccer, I was a midfielder so I did a lot of the running up and down the field, and lacrosse-wise I think it helped with the hands a lot. It’s a different kind of motion in lacrosse for trying to get around guys, so I think that helped as well.”","Born in Markham, Ontario, north of Toronto, Marner evokes comparisons to Patrick Kane and Johnny Gaudreau, other elusive, flashy stickhandlers. But in these parts, the 6-foot, 175 pound Marner is more reminiscent of Doug Gilmour, another smallish Maple Leafs forward who brought a heart and joy to the game.","“He’s skilled, explosive and wants the puck and sees the ice so well,” said Gilmour, who believes Marner will someday break his franchise record for assists in a season, 95.",Tavares said Marner has talked to him on the bench about the patterns he saw opponents employing.,"“He just reads the game so well, not just with the puck, but without it, that he’s able anticipate plays,” Tavares, 28, said.","Whether it’s because of his peach-fuzz cheeks or lack of size, Marner was often overlooked as he developed. But one person has championed those skills from the start: his father, Paul.","When Mitch was 4, his father phoned the hockey skills coach Rob Desveaux to see if he could give the boy private lessons as he had with Tyler Seguin, now with the Dallas Stars.","Desveaux, who runs 3 Zones Hockey School northeast of Toronto, turned Marner down, saying he started training players at age 6.","Paul Marner called a week later, and Desveaux stood firm. A couple of weeks later, Paul called again.","“Oh, my God, this guy,” Desveaux remembered thinking to himself.","When Mitch and his father arrived, Desveaux was in for another shock.","“Oh, my God, he’s tiny,” Desveaux said.","“Yeah, but watch him,” Paul pleaded.","Mitch flew around the ice once, and the skills coach turned to Paul and said: “O.K., he’s in.”",Desveaux has been Marner’s on-ice skills coach ever since.,Marner exudes a boyish charm and sense of warmth that has made him a fan favorite across the league. He has been seen singing along to Bon Jovi on the bench.,"On Feb. 14, during the pregame warm-up in Las Vegas, a young girl in a Leafs jersey held up a sign at ice level. “Hey Mitch. Be My Valentine,” the sign read.","Marner skated over to shrieks of delight from the young girl, and he posed for pictures.","In early March, Marner celebrated the seventh birthday of Hayden Foulon, who has been battling leukemia, by giving tickets to her and her family.","Marner, who met Hayden in 2015 when he was a forward with the O.H.L.’s London Knights, also gave her a necklace with a heart-shaped locket with room for a photo of both of them.","“She is my hero,” Marner said. “She means a lot to me and my family.”","Marner’s rise to hockey’s highest level has not been without bumps, despite early signs of great potential.","In 2013, Marner entered the O.H.L. draft listed at 5-7 and only 130 pounds. He slid all the way to No. 19, amid concerns about his size and durability, a theme throughout his hockey career.","And in the 2015 N.H.L. draft, the Leafs considered taking defenseman Noah Hanifin with their No. 4 overall pick until they settled on Marner. He was sent back to juniors in the 2015-16 season and didn’t crack the Maple Leafs roster until 2016-17. Then, early in his second season, Babcock demoted Marner to the fourth line for a time because the coach was unhappy with Marner’s defensive play.",Marner used the experience to get stronger in the off-season with his longtime off-ice performance coach Dan Noble.,"To boost power in his legs so he could bounce off opponents with acceleration, Noble fitted Marner with a water vest. During squats, the water moves around, creating an imbalance that mimics hockey players’ dynamic movements.","“We call it bulletproofing his hips,” Noble said.","Marner is eligible to become a restricted free agent this summer, and many, including former Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke, believe he can command the kind of money Tavares and Matthews make at around $11 million a season, although such a rich deal would add to the club’s salary-cap challenges.","“He’s their most exciting player,” said Burke, now a television analyst. “I love Auston Matthews, but he ain’t selling tickets. He ain’t exciting. Mitch Marner is exciting.”"
"Ted Lindsay, Hall of Fame Scorer Who Powered Red Wings, Dies at 93 - The New York Times","Ted Lindsay, a Hall of Fame player who packed a fierce combativeness in a slight frame as he helped the Detroit Red Wings win four Stanley Cup championship titles, died on Monday at his home in Oakland Township, Mich. He was 93.","Lew LaPaugh, a son-in-law and the president of the Ted Lindsay Foundation, which raises money for autism research, confirmed the death.","Lindsay, nicknamed Terrible Ted, played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League, 14 of them with the Red Wings, coming out of retirement for the final one. He was the first N.H.L. player to play 1,000 games, a first-team All Star eight times and a participant in 11 All-Star games. The Red Wings named him their captain.","Lindsay could be scrappy off the ice as well. In the mid-1950s he led an initially unsuccessful effort to create a players’ union, for which he paid a price.","In Detroit, Lindsay is revered as part of a celebrated triumvirate, the Production Line, in which he played left wing alongside Gordie Howe at right wing and Sid Abel at center. He was the last surviving member of that trio.","All three were elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, Lindsay in 1966, a year after his final retirement, when the three-year waiting period for eligibility was waived. And all three are remembered at the Red Wings’ new home, the Little Caesars Arena (as they were at the team’s previous home, Joe Louis Arena), where oversize jerseys hang from the rafters bearing their retired numbers — Howe’s 9, Abel’s 12 and Lindsay’s 7.","In 1950, Lindsay won the Art Ross Trophy as the league’s scoring champion; Abel finished second and Howe third. In all, in 1,068 regular-season games, Lindsay recorded 379 goals and 472 assists for 851 points, making him at the time the highest-scoring left wing.","A battler on the ice, perhaps to compensate for his size — 5-foot-8 and about 165 pounds — he was heavily penalized, too. He spent 1,808 minutes in the penalty box, the equivalent of 30 games.","“I was born a poor loser,” he told The New York Times in 1973, explaining his feistiness. “I wouldn’t talk to anyone who wasn’t on my team.”","Bill Chadwick, a Hall of Fame referee, spent many nights trying to keep Lindsay under control. “Ted was a mean hockey player,” Chadwick once said, “but he was the kind of guy I would have wanted to play for me. He’d do anything to get the puck in the net.”","Robert Blake Theodore Lindsay was born on July 29, 1925, in Renfrew, Ontario, the home of one of professional hockey’s premiere teams in its early years, the Renfrew Millionaires. Ted’s father, Bert, was a star goaltender for the team and played as well in the early N.H.L. His mother, Maude (Villemarie) Lindsay, was a homemaker.","In 1929, with the onset of the Depression, the family moved to Kirkland Lake, Ontario, where Bert Lindsay worked in the gold mines and where Ted grew up.","After two years in junior hockey, he joined the Red Wings at 19 in 1944 and remained with them until 1957. That was the year Lindsay led a group that tried to establish a players’ union.","Lindsay took his plans to Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamsters union boss, who told him that professional athletes did not need a union. Jack Adams, the Red Wings’ longtime general manager, had another response: He traded Lindsay to the Chicago Blackhawks.","Lindsay recalled that in his first game against his old team, he smacked Howe over the head. Howe remembered, too. “I laid him out,” Howe said. “Then I asked him if this was the way he wanted to play.”","Lindsay got up off the ice, he said, and replied, “No, I guess it’s not worth breaking up a friendship.”","After the Lindsay trade, the new N.H.L. Players’ Association filed a $3 million federal antitrust suit, calling the league a dictatorship. Four months later, in February 1958, the players dropped the suit and plans for a union when the club owners agreed to a $7,000 salary minimum and a 60-percent increase in pension benefits.","The players now have a union, the National Hockey League Players’ Association, and the average salary is about $3 million a year.","Lindsay played three seasons in Chicago (1957-60), retired for four seasons and returned to Detroit for one more, 1964-65.","During his time in Detroit, the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in 1950, defeating the Rangers, 4 games to 3; in 1952, sweeping the Montreal Canadiens, 4-0; and in 1954 and 1955, beating the Canadiens each time, 4-3. In 133 playoff games, Lindsay had 47 goals and 49 assists for 96 points.",He later became general manager of the Red Wings (1977-80) and coached them for nine games in the 1979-80 season and 20 games in 1980-81. His coaching record was 5-21-3.,"In later years, Lindsay was a television hockey analyst and a manufacturer’s representative.","He is survived by a son, Blake; two daughters, Lynn Lindsay LaPaugh and Meredith Berman; a stepdaughter, Leslie Richardson; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.","In their playing heyday, Lindsay, Howe and Abel were good friends as well as Production Line teammates. “There was a place we used to meet for drinks after a workout or a game,” Abel, who died in 2000, once said.","Howe saw them as the quintessence of teamwork. “They used to say that if you blindfolded us, we’d still be able to find one another,” he said. “All of us knew where everyone else was at any given moment. Maybe the closeness off the ice had something to do with it.”"
"For the First Time, an N.H.L. Game Is Broadcast in Plains Cree - The New York Times",MONTREAL — Fred Sasakamoose thought this day would never come.,"Sasakamoose, the N.H.L.’s first Indigenous player when he skated in 11 games with the Chicago Black Hawks during the 1953-54 season, watched from the Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation in northern Saskatchewan on Sunday night as the Montreal Canadiens battled the Carolina Hurricanes — and heard his own language.","It was the first N.H.L. broadcast in Plains Cree, the Algonquian language he grew up speaking.","“It makes me so proud that they’re going to broadcast the game in my language,” he said in a telephone interview before the game.","“I heard people broadcast local tournaments, the Indian Stanley Cup they call them. This evening I am going to listen to the game and understand, because I’m a Cree Indian.”","Sunday’s production was born out of discussions between Sportsnet, the league’s Canadian national TV rights holder, and the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a Canadian cable channel dedicated to promoting the country’s Indigenous heritage.","Community leaders approached Sportsnet last year, wanting to continue the work done at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, where A.P.T.N. aired 10 hours a day of coverage in a mix of Indigenous, French and English languages.","“As a group, we discussed how to use hockey and tie it in with the Cree language,” said Rob Corte, Sportsnet’s vice president of N.H.L. production. “It was a very informative, interesting and emotional meeting, and we left there thinking that we wanted to do something.”","The broadcasters Clarence Iron, Earl Wood, Jason Chamakese and John Chabot, an eight-year N.H.L. veteran and former assistant coach with the Islanders, called the game from the A.P.T.N. studios in Winnipeg, Manitoba, via a live feed provided by Sportsnet.","“It’s very monumental in that a lot of our people struggle on an everyday basis because of their disconnection from their everyday self,” said Wood, who hosted the studio show. “A lot of our young people are shy about speaking the language. If they hear it on the mainstream media, we can use this to our advantage for the retention of our language.”",One of the biggest challenges for the broadcast team was finding words in Plains Cree that describe the in-game hockey events and projecting them quickly enough during the real-time action.,"The commentators built their vocabulary during the 2010 Olympics, when A.P.T.N. covered hockey in Cree. They developed words by talking with community elders and Plains Cree speakers.","“The puck itself, we call it napakiwānis, which is something that is pressed down,” Iron said.","Other terms like kocīw (he shoots), osīhēw pīhtokwahēw (he scores), kipahwāw (penalty), and tako (overtime) translate more directly from English.","The game also served as a showcase for the league’s most prominent Indigenous player, Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price, whose mother is a former chief of the Ulkatcho First Nation in northern British Columbia. During a stellar career that has seen him become the Canadiens’ franchise leader in wins, Price has supported Indigenous youth by hosting them at games.","“I feel like this game is meant for everybody,” Price said this month after winning his 315th career game to pass Jacques Plante for first place in franchise history. “It’s obviously a league motto, but I definitely have seen that first hand. I think it’s important that you need to be proud of where you come from and enjoy the game for what it is.”","Lining up opposite Price on Sunday was Hurricanes forward Micheal Ferland, who is Cree. The Hurricanes won, 2-1, in overtime.","The trailblazing Sasakamoose acknowledged the hardships that Indigenous Canadians still face, including significantly higher rates of suicide and alcoholism. Nights like Sunday, with Indigenous ice hockey stars showcased on national television in their own language, have the potential to inspire youth and make them proud of the heritage, he added.","Sasakamoose spent years at one of Canada’s notorious residential schools, a government-supported program that for a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children by separating them from their families and often forbidding them from speaking their Native languages.","“This is going to create opportunities for young people,” he said. “They’re going to change the world for our young people by giving them that chance, that someday they too could be the same as the Micheal Ferlands on TV.”"
"Andy Hebenton, N.H.L. Ironman with 630 Consecutive Games, Dies at 89 - The New York Times","Andy Hebenton, who never missed a game during eight seasons with the New York Rangers and a final season with the Boston Bruins in setting a record at the time of 630 consecutive National Hockey League appearances, died on Tuesday in Gresham, Ore. He was 89.","His death, at an assisted living facility near Portland, was confirmed by his son Clay, who said he had congestive heart failure.","Hebenton was only 5 feet 9 inches and 180 pounds or so but was essentially indestructible, playing on right wing in the old six-team N.H.L. during the 1950s and ’60s, when players had yet to wear helmets and brawls were common.","He appeared in 216 straight games in the minors before the Rangers obtained him in 1955 and, coincidentally, another 216 consecutive games in the minor leagues after the Bruins released him in 1964.","Hebenton’s streak of 1,062 consecutive professional games, in both the minor and major leagues, ended in the 1967-68 season, when he left the Portland Buckaroos of the Western Hockey League to attend the funeral of his father, Robert, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.","Hebenton eclipsed the N.H.L. record of 580 consecutive games played, set by Johnny Wilson, a wing, who skated for four teams. Doug Jarvis is now No. 1 on the ironman list, having appeared in 964 straight games with three teams in the 1970s and ′80s.","Hebenton’s closest call to missing an N.H.L. game came in the 1956-57 season, when he won the league’s Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly play combined with exceptional talent.","In a game at the old Madison Square Garden, he was poked in the eye with a stick, causing the lid to puff up.","“It shut so tight I couldn’t see at all,” Hebenton told Sports Illustrated in 1967. “But somehow our club doctor managed to squeeze drops of some kind into it the next night in Montreal. The eye opened up a little, just enough so that I could get into the game.”","Hebenton was among the top 10 goal-scorers three times during his N.H.L. career. His highest point total came in the 1958-59 season when he scored 33 goals and had 29 assists, No. 3 on the Rangers in total points behind the future Hall of Fame wing Andy Bathgate and center Red Sullivan. He played in the 1960 N.H.L. All-Star Game.","But, as he told it, he wasn’t especially a home-crowd favorite; many Ranger fans, he said, felt he wasn’t tough enough. He incurred only 80 penalty minutes as a Ranger and appeared six times among the top five in balloting for the Lady Byng award.","When Hebenton lost seven teeth on the ice in a two-week period in January 1961, The New York Times took notice with an article headlined “Hebenton Puts Teeth in His Game: Quiet Ranger Is Still Not Angry after Losing Seven.”",Hebenton figured that the fans would finally be satisfied.,"“I got my teeth knocked out, so now they should have no complaints,” he told The Times. “I admire guys who are tough and mean, and maybe I’d get more recognition if I was a mean guy. But when you go around knocking everybody down, you’re too tired to put a puck in the net. I was hired to score goals, not to sit in the penalty box.”","Andrew Alexander Hebenton was born on Oct. 3, 1929, in Winnipeg. He received his first pair of skates when he was 5 and tried them out in a backyard rink built by his father, a city Parks Department worker.",He was obtained by the Rangers after playing in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Western Hockey League.,"Hebenton finished second to Glenn Hall, the Detroit Red Wings’ goalie and a future Hall of Famer, in the balloting for the 1955-1956 Calder Cup as the N.H.L. rookie of the year; he had scored 24 goals with 14 assists.","His most memorable goal came during the first overtime in Game 2 of the Rangers-Montreal Canadiens Stanley Cup semifinals in 1957. Skating along the right boards, he put a 15-foot shot past goalie Jacques Plante to give the Rangers a 4-3 victory. But the Canadiens captured the series, 4 games to 1, and won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Bruins in the finals.","The Rangers reached the playoffs four times during Hebenton’s years with them, but never made it to the championship round.","The Bruins selected Hebenton for a fee of $20,000 in the N.H.L. draft after the 1962-63 season. He scored 12 goals in his only season with them. He was then sent to the minors and never returned to the N.H.L., playing mostly in the Western Hockey League for Portland and the Victoria Maple Leafs before retiring at 45.",He later owned a cement contracting business in the Portland area.,"In addition to his son Clay, who was a goalie with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the World Hockey Association for two seasons in the 1970s, Hebenton is survived by another son, Tim; three daughters, Melanie Walker, Karen Hebenton and Terry Fisher; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His wife, Gael (Beveridge) Hebenton, died in 2014.","In describing how he didn’t satisfy the blood lust of some Ranger fans, Hebenton told The Times that he had showed grit going back to childhood.","“I was knocked down by a bus when I was 4 and hit in the head with a baseball bat when I was 6,” he said. “Now what is there to be scared about in a hockey game?”"
Glen Sather Steps Down as Rangers President; Islanders Stay in Second - The New York Times,"The Hall of Fame executive Glen Sather is stepping down as the president of the Rangers and will assume a new role as senior adviser to the team owner, James L.

He ceded general manager duties to the longtime assistant Jeff Gorton before the 2015-16 season.,"The team will immediately begin a search for a new president, Dolan said Thursday. The Rangers join the Ottawa Senators as N.H.L. teams looking for a president to oversee hockey operations. Gorton will remain general manager.",The Rangers made the playoffs 12 times with Sather and reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2014. They will not make the postseason this year.

We thank Glen for his dedication to the Rangers, and to all of hockey, and look forward to his continued contributions to our team in his advisory role.”","Before joining the Rangers, Sather spent roughly two decades with the Edmonton Oilers and helped them win the Stanley Cup five times as general manager and coach. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the builder category in 1997.","While Sather’s finest work came building the Oilers’ dynasty, he also brought the Rangers back to respectability after some down years in the late 1990s.

"On ‘Made in America,’ Trump’s F.T.C. Appointees May Be Out of Step With Him - The New York Times",WASHINGTON — A strange dynamic has gripped the Federal Trade Commission: President Trump’s biggest allies are the Democrats.,"In a vote made public Wednesday, the commission’s two Democratic appointees voted to impose financial penalties on companies the agency found violated federal law by falsely marketing their products as “Made in America” when, in fact, most of their merchandise was manufactured in China.","But the three Republican commissioners — all appointed by Mr. Trump — overruled them and voted against imposing any fines or penalties at all. They said the companies should not be required to admit any wrongdoing or notify customers of their false marketing, arguing that the threat of future penalties served as a strong enough deterrent to prevent a repeat offense.","The vote, which took place on Tuesday, broke along party lines — just not necessarily the expected ones.","Since the 2016 election, Mr. Trump has promoted himself as the man who will resuscitate American manufacturing and jobs. In April 2017, he signed a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order, with the goal of promoting American-made goods “to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.”","But on the F.T.C., Mr. Trump’s own appointees appeared to be out of step with the trade policy espoused by the president.","“The Republican commissioners didn’t get the memo from President Trump about the ‘Buy America, Hire America’ administration,” said Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group.",White House officials declined to comment.,"The case at hand involves three companies that the trade commission found violated the law. One was a New Jersey-based hockey puck manufacturer, Patriot Puck, which wrapped its China-made hockey pucks in American flags and falsely declared them “The Only American Made Hockey Puck!”","Two more companies, Sandpiper and PiperGear, manufacturers of deployment bags and tactical gear, marketed their wears to active and retired American military personnel, branded themselves online as #MadeInUSA, and put “American Made” tags in some of their products. In reality, most of those goods were also manufactured in China, according to the commission.","Mr. Trump’s handpicked chairman of the commission, Joseph J. Simons, defended the decision not to impose penalties on the companies. In a statement, Mr. Simons said “the threat of significant penalties” going forward had “been largely successful in keeping companies under order from making deceptive ‘Made in U.S.A.’ claims.” He argued that the decision was consistent with how the commission had dealt with similar cases in the past, and said it was a “strategic choice” to use the commission’s “limited resources” simply to make sure the companies did not break the law in the future.","But on Wednesday, one of the Democratic commissioners who had previously sided with Mr. Simons changed her position. “I am persuaded that we should seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and an admission of liability in these cases,” Rebecca Kelly Slaughter wrote in a dissenting statement. “And I understand that, if the companies refuse to agree to such terms, we would have to expend substantial resources for, and take on the risk associated with, litigation.”","The more stringent penalties, Ms. Slaughter said, “would send an unmistakable message that there will be meaningful consequences for brazenly mislabeling wholly imported products as American-made — even the first time that a fraudster gets caught.”","The agency’s other Democratic commissioner, Rohit Chopra, is taking the crusade against violators a step further, attempting to change the agency’s entire approach to handling “Made in America” violations.","Mr. Chopra, in a dissenting statement, argued that the F.T.C. was given the authority to activate steep penalties on first-time violators since the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed in 1994 but has simply never used it. Mr. Chopra said he wanted the trade commission to activate a legal switch to “turn on” penalties that would make violators pay $42,530 in fines per violation, starting on the first offense.","In many cases over the past two decades, settlements with companies that violated “Made in America” rules were subject only to record-keeping and reporting requirements to make sure they did not violate the law again.","“We cannot effectively protect honest businesses and promote fair competition if there are no consequences for violating the law,” Mr. Chopra said in his dissenting opinion. “Given troubling trends in today’s economy, I intend to make a motion to pursue a Made in U.S.A. rule that would allow the commission to seek meaningful penalties against those that harm law-abiding companies that make goods in America.”"

Nominally a story about the transformative power of sports, it is, like many supposed sports novels (and films, for that matter, and TV shows), actually about friendship, morality and achievement. Whether you have any feelings at all about hockey (I don’t, really), it is impossible not to get swept up in these kids’ lives and what they learn on the ice. At a time when a lot of cynicism is about to be attached to the whole concept of an athlete, there is a purity here, a sense of pain and joy, that has nothing to do with hackneyed metaphors and everything to do with compelling characters and a wrenching story, beautifully told. (Also: There is a great sequel.)","— Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic"
"David Quinn’s Rangers Get Many Teachable Moments, but Few Wins - The New York Times","On the day after February’s trade deadline stripped the Rangers of three key veterans, David Quinn’s whistle pierced the practice rink air. The coach barked with the rasp of a well-worn instructor’s voice, “That can’t happen.” The Rangers reran the drill, which Quinn this time punctuated with “good job.”","An hour into the session, Quinn skated in to speak quietly with Brendan Lemieux during a defensive routine. Lemieux, the 23-year-old prospect acquired in a trade for Kevin Hayes, had met Quinn only that morning after joining from the Winnipeg Jets.","“That’s what was really cool about my first practice,” Lemieux said afterward. “I was already learning things, being taught. I guess that goes to what kind of coach he is. He’s a teacher. There are a lot of N.H.L. coaches that aren’t like that.”","With the Rangers more than a year into a rebuild, teaching a young team has been Quinn’s primary objective. Ten players on the Rangers’ roster are 23 or younger. Entering the final game of the season, the Rangers have just four wins in 19 games since the trade deadline on Feb. 25, though seven losses were by a single goal, including five in overtime or a shootout.","“We were close, but that doesn’t cut it in this league,” Quinn said.","He arrived in New York last May after five years as the head coach at Boston University and more than two decades leading or assisting predominantly A.H.L., college and national team development programs. Quinn’s own promising playing career came to an abrupt end in college with the diagnosis of hemophilia and a life-threatening injury.","“When you look at what he’s gone through as a coach in order to reach the pinnacle of the game, not a lot of people would go through what Quinny has gone through,” said Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan, a former teammate at B.U. “I think that’s a reflection of his love of the sport but also his competitive nature.”","General Manager Jeff Gorton called Quinn’s track record with young players a huge part of his appeal. That recent history included work with four first-round picks while leading B.U., a group headlined by the Buffalo Sabres star Jack Eichel. Quinn, 52, had taken over for the longtime coach Jack Parker — for whom Quinn played in the 1980s — and he expected to spend his career there even as three N.H.L. teams called to gauge his interest.","But, Quinn said, “It’s the New York Rangers.”","“I really don’t think I ever would have left B.U. for any other situation, or people, or organization than this,” he added. “Everything aligned. Every single thing.”","Quinn has so often preached his desire that the Rangers play “fast, physical, and relentless” hockey that some players refer to the phrase as “our team slogan.” His first season was notable for its hard practices, blunt postgame assessments and healthy scratches. Quinn’s players, past and present, consistently mention his honest and direct style of giving feedback.","“He’s very good at communicating, but he’s so smart about the way he does it, too,” Eichel said.","Sabres forward Evan Rodrigues, who played his junior and senior seasons at B.U. under Quinn, had a goal and an assist in his first game for Quinn in October 2013. Afterward, Quinn asked the player for a self-evaluation. Rodrigues said, “Probably like a B, B+.” Quinn replied, “Well, I give you a C-.”","In hindsight, Rodrigues realized his coach was right.","“I don’t doubt much that he says,” Rodrigues said, before adding: “I’m very, very thankful for him because I don’t think I’d be where I am today if it weren’t for him.”","Quinn attributed that plain-spoken manner partly to his father — “an old-school Irish cop” — and to his sudden diagnosis as a college sophomore with hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease.","“Life experiences form all of us,” he said. “I think that is probably why I’m so direct with people because of what I’ve been through personally. I really believe those experiences — because I really struggled for two years after that. Then I got back on my feet and went, ‘All right, hey, look how lucky I am, really.’”","After Quinn dealt with persistent bruising throughout the 1985-86 season, B.U.’s team physician suggested he get blood work after the playoffs. The tests showed hemophilia.","“I’m 20 years old and I think I’m going to play in the N.H.L. and I think I’m going to play for the ’88 Olympic team,” Quinn said. “You’re talking about a big kick in the teeth, you know? I’m trying to scramble. What am I going to do with my life? I had my next 15 years mapped out. I was a first-round pick, I’m going to play in the N.H.L. And I went through some tough times, but I always thought to myself, ‘The people who really have affected me in my life other than my parents are my coaches.’”","Quinn continued playing for B.U., but, after an injury-plagued junior season, he badly sprained his right ankle playing pickup basketball. The bruising turned into compartment syndrome, which required surgery. In his Rangers office recently, he rolled down a red-and-blue striped sock to expose a scar running down the outer half of his calf muscle to his ankle.",He was in the hospital for five weeks and said he almost bled to death. His collegiate hockey career was over. Quinn remained at B.U. to finish his sociology degree and helped coach the school’s junior varsity hockey team.,"In 1991, the F.D.A. approved a drug trial to help hemophiliacs clot more quickly. By injecting himself before every practice and game, Quinn returned to the ice in what he refers to only as a “pseudo-comeback.” He had not skated in four years and had lost some mobility in his right foot.","Quinn signed with the Rangers in 1992 and played a year and a half of minor league hockey. He had been a lock for the 1988 Olympic team but was a late cut from the ’92 squad. He tried out one final time for the 1994 roster, but was cut early.","The night he was cut, Quinn was in his family’s home in Cranston, R.I., when his former B.U. assistant coach Ben Smith called. Smith had taken over as Northeastern head coach and offered Quinn an assistant job. He drove to Boston the next day.",Quinn spent two nomadic decades in the coaching ranks. He was associate coach of B.U.’s 2009 N.C.A.A. championship team and was head coach of the 2015 squad that lost in the national title game. He was known for his recruiting panache.,"“I remember my mom couldn’t stop talking about him,” said Rangers defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, who was recruited to B.U. by Quinn. “He put the charm on my mom. I think, more than anything, he just had this presence to him.”","Now, Quinn is charged with coaxing the most out of the Rangers’ young talent.","“They’re a structured team,” said Florida Panthers associate coach Jack Capuano, a lifelong friend of Quinn’s. “They work hard. Obviously they’re buying into what he’s selling.”","Quinn said the Rangers had “some good pieces here to build around,” citing the advances the Islanders and the Canadiens have made since last season.",A talented new piece of the puzzle is likely on its way. The Rangers will participate in the N.H.L. draft lottery on Tuesday.,"Quinn, who lamented the lack of practice time in the N.H.L., called the challenge of rebuilding through development “very appealing.”","“You really get a chance as the coach to be very involved in the process of the next great team here, hopefully,” he said."
Why N.H.L. Player Duncan Keith Calls Himself a Biohacker - The New York Times,"Duncan Keith, 35, is a three-time Stanley Cup champion and Conn Smythe Trophy winner, who recently played his 1,000th professional hockey game, all with the Chicago Blackhawks. A small-town guy at heart, he splits his time between Chicago and Penticton, British Columbia, where he grew up. ","He took a moment out of his punishing National Hockey League season (his 14th!) to share his workout and wellness secrets, and why he is obsessed with infrared therapy lights. ","I get up around 8 a.m. In the 45 minutes before I leave the house, I have a routine: I go upstairs to my lab, where I have a bunch of little things that I do to stay healthy. I try to get as much sunlight as possible, but I also have Joovv lights — they’re red and infrared lights, which are very healing. ","Then I lay on my Bemer mat, which has electromagnetic currents, for eight minutes. I also have my supplements like glutathione and vitamin C, and liquid herbs like ashwaganda. Sometimes at night, I’ll sleep with a hydrogen inhaler. I’m a biohacker and a part-time hockey player. It’s basically better living with the help of science.","During the season, I don’t do a whole lot of heavy lifting. I use PoV Sport, a machine that uses electricity to keep your muscles contracted. It’s about feeling strong without me having to do any excess movement. ","The off-season is when I work out the hardest. I’m in the gym about five times a week doing strength training. It’s all based on the Evo Ultrafit system that my strength trainer Jay Schroeder does. He’s based out of Phoenix. He trains a lot of professional football players and baseball players. It’s a lot of body-weight stuff and isometrics and speed Russian lunges. I’ll start ice skating in July. By the end of the August, I’m skating four to five times a week.","For me, the biggest thing for my skin care is the Joovv light. But then my buddy is a real skin fanatic with lots of different things. He told me about this skin care company called Eminence, and once in a while I’ll use the exfoliator in the steam shower.","I don’t love the hotel skin care stuff. I bring my own. I use Ancient Minerals body lotion that has magnesium in it. I order it off Amazon. My skin gets nice and moisturized but also gets a dose of magnesium. I use the Ben Greenfield’s serum, which is a mix of vitamin C and a bunch of different herbs. And then I do use cologne. I use the Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Acqua the most.","I wouldn’t say I’m on any specific diet. I’ve read Dr. Mercola’s books and I followed his nutrition plan for a while. But now, I just eat healthy and the biggest thing is getting a lot of calories in. I’m always burning calories during the season, and I’m trying to keep my mass on.",I read a lot of books and I listen to podcasts. My favorite is the Ben Greenfield fitness podcast. I guess you could call him a professional biohacker. I also listen to Aubrey Marcus and Joe Rogan.,"Right now, I’m reading “Medical Medium” by Anthony William. It’s nonfiction and about food and nutrition. I enjoy reading and learning about the body. The first chapter is a little bit goofy, but essentially it’s about how important carbs and fruits are. It goes against a lot of things you hear today. ","I try to dress nice, but I’m not always thinking about it. I really like AllSaints jeans. I get most of my jeans from there. If not that, then I like Hudson jeans or Vince sweatpants. They’re like a classier pair of sweats. Lululemon is always comfortable.","I’ve been on ice skates ever since I was maybe 3 or 4. I was always trying to be a hockey player. But to play professionally, you have to have the determination and focus. I remember there were high school parties that I didn’t go to because I was always working on my game. I missed a lot of those times. You have to set a goal and not let anything get in your way. This involves not only yourself, but also your family and parents. They are all part of it."

One Canceled Flight Upends the N.W.H.L. Playoffs - The New York Times,"Last weekend, the Metropolitan Riveters nearly re-enacted “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” trying to reach their semifinal game of the National Women’s Hockey League playoffs.","The Riveters dealt with predawn alarms; being momentarily stranded in Charlotte, N.C.; and losing most of their equipment. The game, against the Minnesota Whitecaps in St. Paul, scheduled for last Sunday, was postponed. The semifinal will now be played Friday night in St. Paul, with the Isobel Cup final scheduled for two days later at the same rink.","The N.W.H.L., in its fourth season, has had travel-and weather-related postponements before, as have other professional leagues like the W.N.B.A. Despite partnerships with four N.H.L. franchises, N.W.H.L. teams still travel with budgetary and time constraints.",Some Riveters players who expected to play last Sunday will not be available for the rescheduled game because they cannot take the day off from their full-time jobs.,"Kelsey Koelzer, a star on defense for the Riveters, is one of those casualties in the tough financial landscape still facing pro women’s hockey. This year, N.W.H.L. salaries range from $3,000 to $10,000.","“It’s very frustrating,” Koelzer said after practice Tuesday night, beginning to choke up. “You work hard the whole season. You dedicate so much of your time. I’ve done my absolute best to get to every game possible. To reflect and think my season is potentially over and I didn’t even know that the last game I was going to play this season was my last game, it’s frustrating. It’s sad.”","Other sacrifices were made for this unusual weekend of women’s hockey in Minnesota. The Buffalo Beauts, the No. 2 seed, gave up the right to possibly host the championship game against the Riveters. The Beauts were 8-0 at their home rink this season.","Last Saturday, the majority of the Riveters were scheduled on a 2:53 p.m. flight to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport from La Guardia Airport. The team arrived at the airport two hours before takeoff, but because of wintry weather in the Midwest, the flight was canceled.","Anya Battaglino, the director of the N.W.H.L. players’ association, then began working with the league on other options.","An early Sunday morning flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Minneapolis, with a connection in Charlotte, was the most feasible option. Because of daylight saving time, players woke up around 1:30 a.m. to ensure no preboarding snafus. They boarded the plane just past 5 a.m., but it had to be de-iced. An hour later, the team still had not taken off, and began worrying about making its connection and reaching the arena for the opening face-off at 1:30 p.m. Central time.","The Riveters landed in Charlotte around 8:02 a.m., missing their 7:40 a.m. connecting flight. About an hour later, the league announced the game was postponed.","“We were all so delirious and hungry and tired, I think everybody was kind of relieved,” Riveters forward Miye D’Oench said. “Up until that moment, we were still sort of trying to stay in a game-day mind-set. It got harder to do as the day went on and more things went wrong.”","The Riveters touched back down in Queens early Sunday afternoon, only to learn most of their equipment and personal bags were headed to Minnesota.","That was not the only headache. Battaglino, the league office and players on the Riveters, the Whitecaps and the Beauts, who won their semifinal matchup against the Boston Pride on Saturday, had to figure out when and where to hold a makeup game.","A Saturday semifinal and Sunday final was proposed, but some players worried about playing on consecutive days. In addition, the University of Minnesota’s women’s hockey team, a huge draw locally, has an N.C.A.A. tournament game against Princeton on Saturday. Travel for the Riveters and the Beauts also had to be considered.","Eventually, a vote on Monday morning led to the Friday/Sunday setup. But that did not alleviate all concerns. While a majority of the Riveters were to fly out Thursday night (with no serious inclement weather in the forecast), Battaglino said seven players or staff members would travel separately from the team to better accommodate their schedules.","Some members of the Riveters, the defending champions, see the travel problems as a possible advantage against the top-seeded Whitecaps.","“Last weekend’s travel woes were very extreme, and I think it brought us closer as a team,” D’Oench said. “In a certain sense, sometimes going through a lot of adversity can sometimes play to a team’s advantage, and we’ve certainly had no shortage of adversity this season.”",Battaglino said last weekend’s “fire drill” would be a learning experience and help influence future scheduling. The league openly discussed their decision-making process in a letter to fans.,"Koelzer said if the Riveters won Friday, she would look into getting to Minnesota for Sunday’s final. Now well-rested, many of the Riveters are confident they can defeat the Whitecaps, whom they were 0-4 against this season.","But Kimberly Sass, a backup goaltender for the Riveters who documented last weekend’s travel woes on social media, is starting a new full-time job and cannot afford to take Friday off.","On Tuesday, she wrote on Twitter that she hoped that in the future, “female professional athletes will never be faced with the decision to attend a game, or risk ruining a professional reputation at their non-sport place of employment.”"

"In the N.H.L., Finland Is Now Here, There and Everywhere - The New York Times","When the Winnipeg Jets play host to the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday night, the meeting will be more than a showcase of the Central Division leader against the league’s top-scoring line. It will be a glimpse of a decade-long transformation of Finnish hockey.","Patrik Laine of Winnipeg, 20, and Mikko Rantanen of Colorado, 22, have spent much of their young N.H.L. careers among the league leaders in scoring, gaining a spotlight for a golden generation from Finland, one of the smallest, and most successful, hockey-playing nations.","“That age group in Finland, there must be something in the water or they’re feeding them the right things up there,” said the Winnipeg captain, Blake Wheeler.","Seven players from Finland, a country of 5.5 million, have been top 10 draft picks since 2013, and nearly all of them are playing significant roles on their N.H.L. teams.","Laine, the No. 2 pick in 2016, almost immediately became the most recognizable face in Finnish hockey since Teemu Selanne. Despite some lean scoring stretches this season, Laine has been one of the league’s best goal-scorers over the past three seasons. In November, he scored five goals on five shots in a game against the St. Louis Blues, and he became the fourth-youngest player to reach 100 career goals.","The highlight of that month for Laine was the N.H.L’s return to Finland, where he notched a hat trick and then another goal in a pair of games in Helsinki against a fellow Finn, Aleksander Barkov, and the rest of the Florida Panthers.","“His shooting is a work of art,” said Sami Salo, a former N.H.L. defenseman who now coaches in Finland. “It doesn’t matter if the puck comes at a bad angle, he always seem to get a perfect shot any time.”","Rantanen, the No. 10 pick in 2015, has transformed himself into one of the league’s savviest and most imaginative playmakers. With 75 points, Rantanen is fourth in the N.H.L. in scoring and has combined with Nathan MacKinnon and Gabriel Landeskog to compile 206 points, tied with Calgary’s top line for the most of any trio.","“He can find the passing lane even though there’s five sticks in the way,” Laine said of Rantanen, with whom he has trained for the past three summers. “He’s going to find a way. He’s also one of the strongest players that age that I’ve ever seen.”","Two Finnish players, Selanne and Jari Kurri, have led the N.H.L. in goals during a regular season, and both are in the Hall of Fame. But behind Selanne and Kurri in career points per game by Finnish players are four active members of the N.H.L., all of them under 25. They are Laine, Rantanen, Barkov and Sebastian Aho of the Carolina Hurricanes.","Young Finnish defensemen are also making a mark. Dallas Stars defenseman Miro Heiskanen, the No. 3 pick in the 2017 draft, dominated in Finland as a teenager and was an All-Star last month in his first N.H.L. season. He has followed a path similar to that of Buffalo Sabres defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen, selected eighth in 2013.","Finland’s rise is evident in international play, too. In January, the Finns earned the gold medal at the world junior championship for the third time in six years, after winning it only twice in the 40 years before this run.","“If you win three times in six years, that tells you something,” said Rantanen, who played on the 2016 junior champions with Laine, Aho and Toronto Maple Leafs winger Kasperi Kapanen. “It’s not only luck or just one good tournament. In Finnish coaching, the level is going higher and higher. There are a lot of good, young coaches coming, and I think the biggest thing is that the coaches are trying to concentrate on individuals more than five or 10 years ago.”","Neither the national team’s success nor its players’ prolific totals in the N.H.L. are coincidental. Beginning in 2009, Finnish officials made considerable investments and sweeping changes that gave greater continuity to player development. In 2014, after a disastrous under-18 world championship tournament that included a 10-0 loss to its archrival Sweden, the Finnish federation held a wide-ranging summit that emphasized individual skills like skating, puck-handling, shooting, balance and strength training.","“They teach us a lot about playing together, but when we’re playing together, we need all players to have good individual skills, especially skating,” said Barkov, 23, an elite two-way player who averages a point per game. “Hockey is getting a lot faster and more skilled.”","Kurri, a former general manager of the national program, described the old model for success.","“If we didn’t have the most skilled players, we had to be a good as a team,” he said. “That’s how we could have success, for many many years. That and good goaltending, we always had a good goalie behind us.”","Finland did produce a generation of outstanding goalies, including winners of the Stanley Cup and the Vezina Trophy like Miikka Kiprusoff, Antti Niemi and Tuukka Rask. But now netminders have taken a back seat to skaters.","Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne, 36, said that the emphasis on individual skills and the provocation of players’ imaginations through exposure to the N.H.L. has produced the most abundant and diverse crop of Finns ever to emerge in pro hockey.","“The Finnish player type used to be the very reliable, solid, two-way player who had a very successful career, maybe on lower lines,” said Rinne, who won the Vezina Trophy last season. “Now we have these individuals coming up with amazing skill, and I feel like there’s something to that exposure and kids being able to see, copy and try on their own.”","The mind-set is changing for defensemen, too, as Heiskanen and Ristolainen have not only logged big minutes but have also played with flair.","“Defensemen were kind of the players nobody wanted to be because you had to defend,” Salo said. “You can’t score really, you have to stay back. I see a big change in the mind of youngsters who are coming up. They are fearless with the puck; they want to score all the time.”","Jere Lehtinen, a former Dallas Stars right wing and the general manager of Finland’s national team, said that each win, each medal and each successful Finnish N.H.L. player reinforces belief and raises expectations for successive generations. His generation, which won medals at the Olympics and world championships, instilled confidence that games were winnable regardless of opponent, circumstance or score.","“Nowadays these guys, these kids coming in, they just come and they know they can win,” Lehtinen said. “They don’t hesitate at all, they’re not scared of losing.”",The Finnish pipeline shows no signs of drying up. Right wing Kaapo Kakko is expected to be a top 5 pick in the coming draft in June.,"“It has taken a long, long time until the next wave of really good Finnish players,” Rinne said. “Now we are there, and I feel like every year there are new guys popping up. I’m very excited to watch those guys.”"
"Sorry, Canada: Parity Reshapes the World Junior Championship - The New York Times","VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Canada can deliver the crowds, but the rest of the hockey world is catching up when it comes to delivering on-ice results at the World Junior Championship, the top international under-20 men’s hockey tournament.","On Saturday, Finland earned its third gold medal in the last six years in the event, beating the United States, 3-2, in the championship game.","Saturday’s matchup was the first gold medal game between Finland and the United States at the World Junior Championship, but those teams have regularly been on the podium in recent years in an event once dominated by Canada.","Since 1977, Canada has won 17 gold medals, including two runs of five straight titles: from 1993 to 1997, and again from 2005 to 2009.","But this year’s tournament now will live in infamy — at least in Canada — as the first time the Canadians failed to earn a medal when serving as the tournament’s host. Finland eliminated Canada, 2-1 in overtime, in the quarterfinals. Canada has won the event only twice in the last 10 years, while Finland and the United States have each brought home three golds.","The United States is the only country to have reached the podium in each of the last four years (gold in 2017, silver in 2019 and bronze in 2016 and 2018). The Americans’ seven podium appearances in the last 10 years (three gold, one silver, three bronze) are second only to Russia’s eight (one gold, three silver, four bronze).","Finland’s gold was its fifth in tournament history and the federation’s first victory in North America, where games are played on a smaller ice surface than they are in Europe.","“You’re starting to see some teams get into this portion of the tournament regularly,” United States Coach Mike Hastings said. “I think that says a lot about all the programs that we’re talking about — all the countries. This is a very difficult tournament. Seeing who was here at the end — it’s hard to get here. For the countries that are doing it on a consistent basis, I think that says something about where they’re at.”","Dave Starman, an analyst for the tournament for NHL Network, is also a member of the coaching education program with USA Hockey. He said the recent success of American teams could be attributed in large part to a new development model that was introduced 10 years ago.","“We have absolutely reshaped how we’re teaching the game and how we’re teaching coaches how to teach the game,” Starman said. “We have really emphasized small-area games, and it goes along with age-appropriate practices.","“If we play a lot more 3-on-3, 2-on-2, where younger kids are touching the puck more, they’re in an environment where they’re going to have more fun and be more involved,” he added. “Not only are they going to have more fun and want to come back, they’re going to get better because they’re constantly involved in the play.”","The emphasis is the same in Finland, Starman said.","“A lot of their parents and their organizations don’t care who wins the average game by shortening a bench so they can win a game,” he said. “Their players play, and they use their bench. They believe in player development.”","The trends from the World Junior Championship are now showing up in the N.H.L., too. Over the last decade, the American and Finnish federations have increased the number of players they have delivered to the N.H.L.","In 2009-10, the season that John Carlson’s overtime goal in Saskatoon gave the United States a 6-5 win over Canada in the final, 22 percent of N.H.L. players (212) hailed from the United States, while 4 percent (38) came from Finland, according to Quant Hockey.","This season, the N.H.L. is up to 240 American players (26.8 percent) and 49 Finns (5.5 percent). With Finland’s Mikko Rantanen and the Americans Johnny Gaudreau and Patrick Kane among the league’s top scorers, it is not surprising to see that the number of points produced by players from the two nations also has increased — to 26.2 percent from 19.4 in 2009-10 for Americans and to 5.7 percent from 3.8 for Finns.","Jack Hughes, 17, a forward on this year’s American team, is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the N.H.L. draft in June. Kaapo Kakko, 17, who scored the gold medal-winning goal with 1 minute 26 seconds left Saturday, and his teammate Anttoni Honka will be looking to follow in the footsteps of Patrik Laine of the Winnipeg Jets, Jesse Puljujarvi of the Edmonton Oilers and Olli Juolevi of the Vancouver Canucks from Finland’s gold-winning team in 2016; all were selected in the top five at that year’s N.H.L. draft. (A Canadian player has not been chosen No. 1 over all since Connor McDavid in 2015.)","Hockey Canada’s chief executive, Tom Renney, said he recognized the value of increased parity.","“I think if we want this game to be global, we have to recognize it has arrived — that other federations can compete and compete very well,” he said. “I think it’s healthy.”","He added: “You can look at any number of games that we’ve had up to this point in time and recognize that it’s millimeters or milliseconds that can change the outcome of the game. That is certainly fan-friendly, and in my mind, it encourages children to play.”"
"As Huawei’s Influence in Canada Grows, Some Fear Spying. Others Just Want Fast Internet. - The New York Times","MONTREAL — In recent weeks, some viewers of “Hockey Night in Canada” have been jolted by the sight of a distinctive red chrysanthemum logo conspicuously displayed during the broadcast of a sports program as quintessentially Canadian as the national game itself.","It is the logo for Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant whose chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is out on bail in Vancouver, with a GPS tracking device around her ankle, as she awaits possible extradition to the United States to face fraud charges.","Advertising on “Hockey Night” is just one example of the expanding footprint of Huawei in Canada, where it has invested a total of $500 million in research and development, including into 5G technology at leading Canadian universities.","It also has research facilities in Ottawa, Waterloo, Montreal, and Vancouver; is providing high-speed internet to remote areas of the country; and employs about 1,100 people in Canada.","Now, the company finds itself at the center of a rift in Chinese-Canadian relations caused by Ms. Meng’s case, which includes charges of evading United States economic sanctions on Iran. Following her arrest, China detained several Canadians and sentenced a Canadian drug smuggler to death, in what many here viewed as retaliation. If Canada decides to extradite her, which legal experts say is likely, there are concerns of significant reprisals.","Even before Ms. Meng’s arrest, which has incensed China, some experts were warning that Huawei’s growing presence in Canada could undermine the country’s economic interests and security.",Her case has only intensified those worries.,"Canadians should take notice that “a company that is invested hugely in Canada is facing serious allegations of fraud,” said David Mulroney, Canada’s ambassador to China from 2009 to 2012.","He noted that Huawei had been adept in its approach to the Canadian market, using savvy marketing techniques.","“The message that Huawei is on your side in hockey is very shrewd,” Mr. Mulroney said, referring to the “Hockey Night” sponsorship. “Hockey is as close to the Canadian psyche as you can get.”",Huawei’s attempt to woo Canadians comes as Canada’s security agencies are undertaking a national security review of whether Huawei technology should be allowed in Canada’s nascent 5G telecommunications network. That review will determine if Canada will accede to pressure from the United States to ban Huawei products from its 5G wireless networks amid concerns they could be used by the Chinese government for espionage.,[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.],Australia and New Zealand have already followed the United States by blocking Huawei from supplying technology for 5G infrastructure.,"Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for the Canadian public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, declined to comment specifically on Huawei, but said the government was carefully assessing the security challenges and potential threats of 5G technology.","“We will ensure that our networks are kept safe for Canadians,” he said.","Some experts argue against what they say is American demonizing of Huawei and say the Chinese company owes its success in Canada to making reasonably priced, good quality products consumers like to buy.",But former government officials have expressed concern.,"Richard Fadden, a former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who also was a national security adviser to two prime ministers, said Huawei represented a clear cybersecurity threat to Canada since Chinese companies like Huawei were required, by law, to respond to directions from the Chinese state, which collects intellectual property and intelligence from Western countries, including Canada.","“I would counsel the government to forbid the use of Huawei equipment in the development of our 5G network,” Mr. Fadden wrote in an email.",He added that any controls or firewalls that worked today would eventually be overcome by China’s “very sophisticated and ingenious security agencies.”,"At a news conference last week in Toronto, Huawei’s chairman, Liang Hua, insisted the company posed no threat. “On issues of cybersecurity, Huawei would never do anything to harm any country, any organization or any individual,” Mr. Liang said.",He said there was no law in China requiring companies “to install back doors or collect foreign intelligence.”,"He added that if Huawei ever received such a request from the Chinese state, it would not execute it because the law does not require it to do so.","Sitting in front of a sign with the words “10 Years” — representing Huawei’s decade of doing business in Canada — superimposed on a red Canadian maple leaf, Mr. Liang expressed Huawei’s continued commitment to Canada and praised the country as “an open and inclusive place.”",He also commented on Ms. Meng’s case.,"“I hope that the Canadian legal system could bring justice back to her,” he said, adding that the American pressure on its allies over Huawei had provided “a free round of advertisement for the company.”","Perhaps nowhere has Huawei’s influence in Canada been more present than in research and development, including at leading Canadian academic institutions, where it has made big investments in research.","These investments have generated alarm that, in return for money, cash-strapped Canadian universities are relinquishing control to Huawei of intellectual property related to 5G, while making themselves vulnerable to infiltration by China’s security apparatus.","Christian Chua, president of research at Huawei Canada, told reporters last week at the news conference that Huawei shared its intellectual property with the Canadian universities with which it partnered.","Wesley Wark, an intelligence expert at the University of Ottawa, noted that universities were typically not vigilant when it came to security issues.","He added, however, that the current “scaremongering” about Huawei was misplaced given that both China and Huawei had too much to lose if they spied on the West and lost access to those markets.","Nevertheless, concerns that Huawei’s products and infrastructure, including smartphones or cellular base stations, could be used by Chinese intelligence services have been swirling on some Canadian college campuses, including McGill University in Montreal.","In December, Canadian Security Intelligence Service officials briefed about 15 researchers there who receive funding from Huawei about national security risks.","According to Vincent Allaire, a spokesman for McGill, the spy agency warned the researchers, among other things, that the technology they were working on in partnership with Huawei included “dual-use technology” that could potentially be used for military purposes.",Officials at other universities disputed there were any major risks involved in the research partnerships.,"John-Paul Heale, who oversees company-sponsored research at the University of British Columbia, said Huawei had contributed about $8 million for 14 research projects over three years.",He stressed that the university could not become an outpost for secret research on behalf of the Chinese state because all research was required to be published in peer-reviewed journals.,"“Our research is not happening in the shadows,” he said.","While Huawei’s business has been curtailed in the United States amid spying fears, the company is banking on the fact that in Canada, the desire for reasonably priced smartphones and high-speed internet is what ultimately matters to consumers.","That appears to be the case in Lac La Hache, British Columbia, population 258, a rural community about 300 miles from Vancouver, where Huawei has partnered with the internet provider ABC Communications to provide high-speed internet.","Robert Fry, owner of Cariboo Radio station, said he currently has to commute 45 minutes each day to another town that has an internet connection fast enough to operate a web-based radio station.","Thanks to Huawei technology, he said he hopes to be able to work locally and save $20,000 a year.","“There are fears that China is corrupt and watching what we do and some people are scared they could spy on us,” he said. “But I’m not worried about that. What matters to me is getting high-speed internet.”"
Washington’s Most Popular Russian (and His Teammates) Honored at White House - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump reveled in the apparent fizzling of a two-year effort to prosecute him for possible illicit coordination with Russia during the 2016 campaign, Washington’s most prominent Moscow native arrived at the White House on Monday to celebrate.",The milestone? A hockey championship.,"Some members of the Washington Capitals, who won their first Stanley Cup title in June, boycotted the White House event in their honor, which included a private tour and a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. But not Alex Ovechkin, the team’s Russian captain and the National Hockey League’s most valuable player, who is also a vocal admirer and personal friend of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.","Mr. Ovechkin was not the only Russian player in the Oval Office on Monday. He was joined there by two teammates: Evgeny Kuznetsov, a forward, and Dmitry Orlov, a defenseman, who were part of a 55-member Capitals delegation, the first from a Washington team to visit the White House since the Washington Redskins won the Super Bowl in 1992.","“You’re champions,” Mr. Trump told them, after reading out Mr. Ovechkin’s statistics for the season “You have a champion’s heart.”","Braden Holtby, the Capitals goalie and an outspoken gay rights advocate, declined to visit the White House. “I’ve got to stay true to my values, and I’m going to respectfully decline,” Mr. Holtby told reporters last week. Two other members of the championship team, Brett Connolly and Devante Smith-Pelly, also said they would not attend.","The irony of the photo-op, in which Mr. Ovechkin stood smiling behind the Resolute Desk next to Mr. Trump, wearing a red tie that matched the president’s signature look, wasn’t lost on some former White House officials.","“Perhaps the only time Russians have visited the Trump White House with bipartisan support in D.C.,” said Andy Hemming, a former White House staff member.","Another former aide pointed out that the White House was a natural place for the Stanley Cup to visit, after Mr. Ovechkin took the trophy on a tour of Moscow’s Red Square last summer.","Mr. Ovechkin has said he is an apolitical sports star. But questions about his connections to Mr. Putin, and whether he is a participant, knowingly or unknowingly, in a Kremlin propaganda machine, have swirled around his career. They peaked when Mr. Ovechkin announced last year the creation of a “civic movement” that he branded online as #putinteam, ahead of Russia’s elections.","Mr. Ovechkin, who received a wedding gift from Mr. Putin and reportedly has his personal phone number, insisted that the hashtag and the campaign were simply his own project, involving no input or signoff from Mr. Putin’s government. There were questions, however, about whether a public relations firm with Kremlin connections was involved.","The three Russians on the Capitals have said their concern is providing entertainment and escape, not influencing global leaders. “A real sport, like art, always brings people together,” Mr. Kuznetsov said in a recent interview with the Russian news media. “And the better we play, the more people will get away from political and other news.”","But the optics of Monday afternoon’s event recalled another Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump took with Russians, in May 2017. At that meeting Mr. Trump told Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, and Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, that firing the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, took “great pressure” off him.","That conversation reinforced the belief that Mr. Trump had fired Mr. Comey because of the F.B.I.’s investigation into possible collusion between Russian operatives and the campaign — a move that would have potentially implicated him in another crime, obstruction of justice.","But as the Capitals players balanced the Stanley Cup on the Resolute Desk, another “great pressure” seemed to have been relieved. On Friday, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, concluded his two-year investigation, and in a four-page letter to congressional leaders released on Sunday night, William P. Barr, the attorney general, said the investigation had ended without finding any collusion with the Russians.",Mr. Ovechkin thanked the president for hosting his team and promised to try to win the Stanley Cup again this season.

"Ira Gitler, Influential Jazz Critic and Historian, Dies at 90 - The New York Times","Ira Gitler, who was one of the most respected and prolific jazz writers of the postwar era and an early champion of bebop, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 90.","His son, Fitz, confirmed the death, at a nursing facility.","Mr. Gitler’s criticism appeared regularly in publications like DownBeat and JazzTimes. He wrote two books about bebop, the challenging form of modern jazz that emerged in the 1940s. And, along with Leonard Feather and Nat Hentoff, he was among the most prodigious writers of liner notes, annotating more than 700 albums.",In 2017 he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.,"“He had a terrific ear, and could not be fooled by reputation, no matter how,” the jazz writer Gary Giddins said in an email. “Musicians respected him; they considered him one of the tribe. You can’t say that about a lot of critics.”","Mr. Gitler’s immersion in modern jazz led him to a job with the jazz label Prestige Records in 1950. He packed and unpacked 78s, did promotional work and swept the floors. More important, he wrote his first liner notes, in 1951, for “Swingin’ With Zoot Sims,” and later that year produced his first recording session, for the saxophonist Sonny Rollins.","In 1953, he produced a memorable session with Miles Davis on trumpet and Charlie Parker and Mr. Rollins on saxophones. It was, he recalled, a difficult afternoon: Davis was late and, while the group waited, Parker drank nearly a bottle of gin in two large gulps and dozed off. After Davis’s arrival, Mr. Gitler told him, in profane terms, that he was not playing well.","“Maybe he wanted to leave — I think he was bluffing — but he started packing up his horn,” Mr. Gitler said in a 2009 video interview with the filmmaker Bret Primack. “I said I didn’t mean anything, that I was trying to get him going.”","Davis stayed, and the session proceeded. They recorded three songs, finishing with the Thelonious Monk ballad  “ ’Round Midnight,” which Mr. Gitler felt would be less taxing on Davis.","“It turned out to be kind of somber,” Mr. Gitler said. “It had the feeling of that day, and to me it was a masterpiece.” The tune became a staple of Davis’s repertoire.","Mr. Gitler, an amateur saxophonist, called Prestige his finishing school, and his experience there informed the rest of his career. His knowledge of jazz — acquired by going to nightclubs, attending recording sessions and hanging out with musicians — made him an erudite figure in the field. He was an early supporter of musicians like the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon, who spent many years in Europe and out of the American limelight before experiencing a career resurgence in the 1970s.","Mr. Gitler was born on Dec. 18, 1928, in Brooklyn to parents who had immigrated from Russia. His father, Samuel, was a furrier, and his mother, Frances (Goldberg) Gitler, was a homemaker.","At age 5, Ira started taking piano lessons; soon after, he was introduced to swing music by his brother, Monroe, who was 12 years older. Together they listened to big bands on the radio and to records by Count Basie and Benny Goodman. In 1940, Ira tagged along with his brother and a date to see Jimmie Lunceford and his band at the Strand Theater in Brooklyn.","As a teenager, he traveled to nightclubs in Manhattan and first heard bebop live. Writing in 1946 for the Columbia Grammar School newspaper, he reviewed the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie’s electric performance at the Spotlite Club on West 52nd Street. He later recalled their brief first meeting.","“When Dizzy passed my table after his set,” he wrote, “I greeted him familiarly (even though I had never been in his presence) and asked him when he was going to record again. ‘We recorded today,’ he answered with a twinkle in his high-pitched, slightly sandpapery voice.”","While attending the University of Missouri, Mr. Gitler spent time in jazz clubs in St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., and Chicago and, during summer vacations, on 52nd Street and in Harlem. He dropped out of college before graduating and joined Prestige.","In the mid-1950s he left the label to pursue freelance writing — the only jobs he held after that were two stints as an editor at DownBeat, between 1963 and 1970 — and quickly distinguished himself. In his notes for John Coltrane’s album “Soultrane” (1958), Mr. Gitler coined the enduring phrase “sheets of sound” to describe that saxophonist’s intense arpeggio runs.","“The image I had in my head,” Mr. Gitler told the website All About Jazz in 2009, “were bolts of cloth undulating as they unfurled. Coltrane never said anything about the term. He never referred to it when I saw him, and I didn’t ask him about it.”","Mr. Giddins said that Mr. Gitler’s liner notes had helped cement his reputation. “Those notes are as much a part of those albums as the sequencing of tracks and the cover art,” he said.","Mr. Gitler had a close association with Mr. Feather, the longtime jazz critic for The Los Angeles Times. He was an assistant on Mr. Feather’s “The New Encyclopedia of Jazz” (1960), and he completed “The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz” (1999) after Mr. Feather’s death in 1994 and was credited as co-author.","On his own, Mr. Gitler wrote “Jazz Masters of the 40s” (1966) and “Swing to Bop: An Oral History of the Transition in Jazz in the 1940s” (1985).","As passionate as Mr. Gitler was about jazz, he was equally passionate about another pursuit: ice hockey. He played for and coached an amateur-league team, Gitler’s Gorillas, and wrote “Blood on the Ice: Hockey’s Most Violent Moments” (1974). He also wrote for the program sold to fans at Ranger games at Madison Square Garden.","Stan Fischler, a longtime hockey writer and commentator and a friend of Mr. Gitler’s, recalled on Twitter that a high point of Mr. Gitler’s avocation was playing defense on a fantasy hockey team in 1984 in Lake Placid, N.Y., with the Hall of Famers Gordie Howe and Bill Gadsby.","Mr. Fischler wrote that Gadsby, also a defenseman, was worried that Mr. Gitler would not be able to help hold their team’s one-goal lead when he skated onto the ice in the final minute of the game. “As Bill skated past Ira,” he wrote, “Gadsby stopped, leaned over and uttered the deathless words: ‘Ira, just get in the way!’ ” The lead held.","In addition to his son, Mr. Gitler is survived by his wife, Mary Jo (Schwalbach) Gitler, an artist, and two grandchildren.","For all the musicians Mr. Gitler wrote about, Parker and Gillespie made the strongest impressions on him.","“He said that Bird was one half of his heart,” Fitz Gitler said in an interview, “and Dizzy was the other half.”"

"The Islanders Return to Nassau Coliseum, and to Winning in the Playoffs - The New York Times","UNIONDALE, N.Y. — The Islanders supposedly left postseason mayhem at Nassau Coliseum behind four years ago with a Game 6, first-round win against Coach Barry Trotz and his Capitals. Farewells to Long Island were declared after the team lost its next game, in Washington, to end an era — or so fans and players surmised.","Fast forward to 2019, and the Islanders have found their way home, at least part time, to their former and relentlessly raucous original arena after three-plus seasons at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. And a 103-point finish with Trotz now behind their bench earned the Islanders home ice in a playoff series for the first time since 1988, two years before their captain, Anders Lee, was born.",Thunderous cascades of sound again filled the old-school Coliseum on Wednesday night during Game 1 against the Pittsburgh Penguins.,"Three times, the home crowd went wild for Islanders goals in regulation, and it was deafening when Josh Bailey scored 4 minutes 39 seconds into overtime to lift the Islanders to a 4-3 victory. Game 2 is Friday night at the Coliseum.","It was a fitting goal for Bailey, 29, an Islander for his entire 11-year N.H.L. career. He narrowly missed scoring with five seconds left in the third period when his redirection hit the post behind Penguins goaltender Matt Murray. In overtime, the speedy 21-year-old Mathew Barzal, in his postseason debut, backhanded the puck off the post before Bailey swept the rebound past Murray.","“Scoring an overtime winner in the playoffs is stuff you dream about as a kid,” Bailey said. “It’s a good feeling, but that being said, you have to turn the page and get ready for the next one.”",[N.H.L. playoffs: first-round schedule and results],"Bailey joined the Islanders as a 19-year-old in 2008-9 after they selected him ninth over all in the 2008 draft. He arrived a year before the Isles selected John Tavares at No. 1. The face of the franchise for nine years, Tavares is gone now, starting instead for the Toronto Maple Leafs this postseason.","Bailey is signed through 2023-24, and his 797 games played is sixth in franchise history. Skating in the playoffs for the fourth time, Bailey clearly relished the sensation of whipping the home crowd into a frenzy.","“That’s a big reason why we play hockey right there,” said Bailey, who is from Bowmanville, Ontario, about an hour’s drive northeast of Toronto. “We expected it to be an intense game, and it was.”","Fans in one of the upper sections of Nassau Coliseum have long serenaded Bailey to the theme of the DJ Ötzi version of the Bruce Channel song “Hey! Baby.” Words are changed to “Hey, Josh Bailey! — Ooo! Ahh! We wanna know! Will you score a goal?”","As jubilant Islanders followers headed for the Coliseum exits on Wednesday night, they sang the altered lyrics and waved orange playoff towels. That was after they practically drowned out Bailey’s on-ice postgame interview with their voices, all part of the atmosphere at an arena many Islanders fans never really wanted the team to leave in the first place.","After a career-best 71 points last season, Bailey continued his solid play this season under Trotz, with 16 goals and 56 points, the third straight season he reached at least 40 assists.","Bailey wasn’t the only player to hear his name chanted by the home crowd. Goalie Robin Lehner, in his first season with the Islanders, earned the first playoff win of his career, making 41 saves, in only his third career playoff game and first since 2013.","“It was amazing as always,” Lehner said. “This is special. I don’t understand how they can scream for that long. But good for them. Good for them.”","A little more than a year ago, Lehner had a panic attack during a game with the Buffalo Sabres. He later entered the league’s substance abuse recovery program and also learned he had bipolar disorder.","This season, he and Thomas Greiss shared the Jennings Trophy, which is given to the goalies on the team that allowed the fewest goals. Lehner won a career-high 25 games and had a 2.13 goals-against average.","Wednesday’s game had everything to be expected from playoff hockey — the kind of April tempest the Islanders and Penguins exhibited in 2013, when Pittsburgh won a hard-fought series in six games. Postwhistle scrums were common. Hard hits drove opponents into the boards and skate blade stops near the crease seemed to produce higher waves of ice shavings to annoy goaltenders.","The Islanders’ demeanor mirrors their coach’s, and the approach worked against the Penguins, whom Trotz is meeting for a fourth consecutive postseason. His Capitals lost to the Penguins in 2016 and 2017 when Pittsburgh won the Stanley Cup before the Capitals finally upended the Penguins in last year’s second round on the way to winning the Cup.",Trotz was proud of the Islanders’ performance and effort heading into Game 2.,"“They didn’t flinch at all, which is good,” Trotz said. “In close games, we’ve learned to be comfortable, and there are going to be close games in the playoffs.”"
The Flyers’ Goalie-Go-Round May Have Discovered a Star - The New York Times,"VOORHEES, N.J. — There they were, four pairs of goaltender pads propped up in front of a row of stalls in the Philadelphia Flyers’ locker room last week, a testament to one of the more intriguing story lines on the team.","“The good news is that none of them are mine,” said Scott Gordon, the Flyers’ interim coach and a goaltender for the Quebec Nordiques for 23 games in the early 1990s.","Because of injuries, the Flyers have gone through seven goalies this season, tying an N.H.L. record that is shared by three other teams, Gordon’s 1989-90 Nordiques among them. That explains all the pads — with two goalies now suiting up for games and two others still rehabilitating and getting closer to a return.","The upside of all this upheaval is that the Flyers, for now, are thriving because they had to turn to their top goaltending prospect — 20-year-old Carter Hart — for help.","Hart, a second-round draft choice in 2016, began this season playing for the Flyers’ top farm team, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, and the plan was to keep him there, with Gordon as his head coach.","Plans change. Now both of them are with the Flyers, promoted at the same time when Coach Dave Hakstol was fired in December.","Hart won his first two games to extend what had been regarded as a tryout, then later reeled off eight straight victories — tying an N.H.L. record for a goalie under 21 — before the Flyers lost Monday to Pittsburgh, 4-1, with him in the net.","“He’s handled all of the situations that have been presented to him in an exceptional manner,” said Gordon, who previously coached the Islanders from 2008 to 2010. “We’re seeing a lot of maturity that you’re not usually seeing in a 20-year-old.”","Because he has two goaltenders — Brian Elliott and Michal Neuvirth — who are working their way back to full health, Gordon does not want to say if Hart will stay with the team for the remainder of the season. Four healthy goalies are, well, a lot of goalies. But Hart said he was planning to move into the old apartment of his Flyers teammate Jake Voracek. Maybe that’s a sign that he’s not going anywhere.","“The guys have really welcomed me here,’’ Hart said recently, while standing in a quiet corner of the dressing room. “They’ve been really great to me.’’","A native of Sherwood Park, Alberta, Hart said he had become quite aware since he was drafted that taking on the role as the Flyers’ goaltender of the future meant dealing with the demanding standards of Philadelphia’s fans.","The Flyers have not won the Stanley Cup since 1975, when goalie Bernie Parent helped lead the team known as the Broad Street Bullies to their second straight title. The Flyers have lost in the Stanley Cup finals six times since then, most recently in 2010.","Before they drafted Hart, the Flyers selected five goaltenders in the first or second round since that 1975 Stanley Cup triumph. One of them, Anthony Stolarz, is now a backup. Another, Brian Boucher, the team’s No. 1 pick in 1995, did go on to win 21 playoff games for the Flyers. But not the Stanley Cup.","“It’s difficult. There’s pressure,” said Boucher, now 42 and a hockey analyst for the Flyers, NBC Sports and the NHL Network. “The bar was set high by Bernie Parent in the ‘70s, and the fans are longing for those glory days to come back.’’","Parent retired early, at the age of 34, after sustaining a career-ending eye injury in February 1979. That same year, the Flyers drafted another goalie, Pelle Lindbergh, in the second round and he led the Flyers to the Stanley Cup finals in 1985. But later that year, he was fatally injured in an automobile crash; he had been to a team party and was intoxicated when the accident occurred.","Ron Hextall became the next standout Flyers goalie and was part of Philadelphia teams that went to the Cup finals in 1987 and 1997, again without winning a championship. He became the Flyers’ general manager in 2014 but was dismissed last November.",Now Hart has moved into the crease and quickly distinguished himself.,"“So far, he’s done a nice job of handling it,’’ Boucher said. “Still a small window, but he’s done a really nice job.”","The decision to call up Hart and, at the same time, install Gordon as the interim coach, was made by Chuck Fletcher, who took over as the Flyers’ general manager when Hextall was let go. He called the pair of moves “a coincidence.”","Although there was concern that Hart would be joining a floundering team and might struggle at the outset, the decision to promote him now looks like a masterstroke.","Hart has been so steady and unflappable — even as opponents have taken early leads in games — that the Flyers have actually crept into the race for a playoff spot. With a 26-24-7 record, including a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday in Stolarz in goal, the Flyers were just 8 points from a wild-card berth entering Thursday’s games.","“He’s going to only continue to get better,” Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov, who is all of 22, said of Hart. “It’s impressive. He plays with a lot of confidence as a young goaltender. You don’t see that often.”","Hart, who had played junior hockey for the Everett Silvertips in the Western Hockey League for the past four seasons, won his N.H.L. debut on Dec. 19 at home against Detroit, 3-2. He stopped 31 of 32 shots in a victory over Nashville two nights later. The Flyers, adjusting to Gordon, lost seven of the next eight games that Hart started, but his new teammates spotted a trait.","“It’s his maturity — the way he acts around us and on the ice,” Flyers center Sean Couturier said. “He’s way above his years.”","Elliott, 33, and Neuvirth, 30, are hoping to return soon from lower-body injuries. Elliott, out since November, resumed on-ice workouts last month.","His assessment of Hart? “He just stays within himself, and the more patient you are in letting pucks come to you, the better,’’ Elliott said. “It’s like swinging a golf club. You swing too hard, you’ll slice it.”","Elliott suggested that Hart might have benefited from being called up in the middle of the season, when the Flyers were struggling. Perhaps the challenge would have been more difficult had Hart been made the No. 1 goalie entering a season.","Hart shrugged when asked about that notion. “Honestly, when I came up here, there was a lot of stuff going on from a management standpoint, but as one of the players, you just have to go out and do your job,’’ he said.","It’s a job that, for now at least, he is doing astoundingly well."

"Harry Howell, Star Defenseman With Rangers for 17 Years, Dies at 86 - The New York Times","Harry Howell, the Hall of Fame defenseman who became one of hockey’s most durable figures, playing with the Rangers for 17 seasons in a career that spanned 24 seasons in two leagues, died on Saturday in Ontario. He was 86.",His death was confirmed by the Rangers.,"He had dementia and was living at a long-term care facility in Ancaster, outside his hometown, Hamilton.","When Howell joined the Rangers in October 1952, he was among 14 rookies with the team that season. Most didn’t stick around too long, but Howell went on to play in 1,160 regular-season games as a Ranger, a still-standing team record.","The Rangers were often lackluster in Howell’s playing days, but he joined with Andy Bathgate on right wing and Gump Worsley in goal, his fellow rookies and future Hall of Famers as well, to give their frustrated fans of the 1950s and early ’60s some hope.",Howell won the Norris Trophy as the N.H.L.’s leading defenseman in the 1966-67 season and he was a seven-time All-Star.,"Soon after playing in his 1,000th game, in January 1967, he was presented with the Medal of the City of New York by Mayor John V. Lindsay and he was honored at the old Madison Square Garden with the first “night” ever accorded a Rangers player.","Making his Ranger debut on Oct. 18, 1952, facing the Maple Leafs in Toronto, Howell scored on his first shot. But he was known as a “stay at home” defenseman, usually sticking close to his blue line instead of looking for a chance to carry the puck up ice.","At 6 foot 1 and 195 pounds or so, “I was a big guy for the time I played,” he told John Halligan and John Kreiser in “Game of My Life: New York Rangers” (2008). “But I wasn’t the type of guy to go run people. I could take them out of the play but I wasn’t going to skate 50 feet to hit someone.”","Howell finally broke the double-digit mark in goals scored in the 1966-67 season, when he had 12 goals and 28 assists.","“We had Boom-Boom Geoffrion,” he once told the Hall of Fame in recalling that season. “He came to us from the Montreal Canadiens as a power-play specialist. I’d pass him the puck on the right point. He’d pass it back to me. I’d pass to him. Finally, he said, ‘Will you please shoot the puck?’ A few of them went in.”","But for much of the city, the Rangers were often an afterthought, since they were regularly displaced from the Eighth Avenue Garden by more lucrative events.","“The first two weeks of the season, the rodeo was booked in,” Howell told the Hall, which inducted him in 1979. “The Kennel Club had dogs come in in February. And then the circus came in right at the end of the season, and if we made the playoffs you’d be lucky to play two games at home, and the rest would be on the road.”","Henry Vernon Howell was born on Dec. 28, 1932, in Hamilton, Ontario, where his father was a furrier. He joined the Rangers’ junior team at Guelph, Ontario, at 16, and was called up after three seasons there.",Howell was the Ranger captain for two seasons in the 1950s and was voted the team’s most popular player for three consecutive seasons in the 1960s.,"He developed back problems leading to spinal-fusion surgery before the 1969-70 season. The Rangers offered him a management post, but he wanted to continue playing and was sold to the Oakland Seals.","After leaving the Rangers, Howell played another four seasons in the N.H.L., in the Bay Area and with the Los Angeles Kings, then moved to the World Hockey Association in 1973. He was a player-coach for the New York Golden Blades/New Jersey Knights franchise for one season, held the dual role when the team became the San Diego Mariners the following season, then concluded his career playing for the Calgary Cowboys, retiring in 1976 at 43.","He had 94 goals and 324 assists in the N.H.L., playing in 1,411 games, and 7 goals and 36 assists in the W.H.A., appearing in 170 games.","Howell was later general manager of the N.H.L.’s Cleveland Barons and briefly head coach of the Minnesota North Stars, and he scouted for the Rangers and the Edmonton Oilers.","Howell, who had worn No. 3 with the Rangers, and Bathgate, who had donned No. 9, were honored at the Garden in February 2009 when their jersey numbers were retired (in Bathgate’s case for a second time, since Adam Graves’s No. 9 had already been retired). Bathgate died in 2016.","And Howell was selected to represent the Rangers when Canada Post issued a series of stamps in October 2014 honoring a star defenseman from each team in the N.H.L.’s Original Six, predating the league expansion of 1967.","Howell’s survivors include his daughter, Cheryl. His wife, Marilyn, died several weeks ago.

Rangers Trade Mats Zuccarello to Stars for 2 Draft Picks - The New York Times,"The rebuilding Rangers traded Mats Zuccarello, the Norwegian forward who became a fan favorite in New York, to the Dallas Stars on Saturday night for two conditional draft picks.","Zuccarello, 31, has accumulated 113 goals and 239 assists in 509 games with the Rangers, who signed him in May 2010 after the 5-foot-7 skater caught their attention at the Vancouver Olympics.","In return for Zuccarello, the Rangers received a second-round pick in this June’s draft, and a third-round pick in 2020. The second-round pick will become a first-round selection if Dallas wins two playoff rounds this spring and Zuccarello plays half of the games in those two rounds. The 2020 draft pick will become a first-round selection if Zuccarello, who can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, signs a new contract with the Stars.",The Rangers must pay 30 percent of the remainder of Zuccarello’s $4.5 million salary for the rest of this season.,"Zuccarello has led the Rangers in scoring each of the last three seasons, and has 11 goals and 26 assists in 46 games this season. He played his last game with the team on Thursday, a 4-1 loss to the Minnesota Wild at Madison Square Garden.","“I have fun every time I play hockey. I have fun every time I am in this rink,” Zuccarello said in a quiet Rangers locker room after that game. “Whatever happens, happens.”","The return in the deal seems underwhelming for the Rangers, who may still trade forward Kevin Hayes, a pending unrestricted free agent, and defenseman Adam McQuaid before Monday’s 3 p.m. deadline.","In Saturday’s 5-2 home win over the Devils, Zuccarello, Hayes and McQuaid were scratched. Mika Zibanejad, Zuccarello’s high-scoring linemate, spoke of the Rangers’ emotional state with the trade deadline looming.","“Mats is a really good friend of mine,” said Zibanejad, whose pregame ritual includes sharing a hug with Zuccarello at the end of warm-ups. “Not seeing him be part of the team before the game and being out there with us, it’s tough.

Companies Falsely Labeled Products ‘Made in U.S.A.’ Their Financial Penalty? $0. - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — Patriot Puck, a New York-based company, wrapped its hockey pucks in American flags, declaring them “The Only American Made Hockey Puck!”","The mattress firm Nectar Sleep, founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, promoted its mattresses as “designed and assembled in the U.S.A.”","Two California-based manufacturers of deployment bags, tactical gear and other merchandise marketed to active and retired American military personnel sold the products online as #MadeInUSA, and inserted “American Made” tags into its products.","In reality, most of the products were manufactured entirely in China, according to the Federal Trade Commission.","Last fall, the F.T.C. determined that all four companies had violated federal law by engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts” and falsely marketing their goods as American-made.","But while President Trump has accused China of destroying American jobs and prioritized strengthening United States manufacturing, his appointees at the F.T.C. did little to punish the firms. The companies faced no fines and were not required to admit any wrongdoing or to notify customers of their false marketing. The trade commission entered into proposed consent agreements with each firm barring them from falsely marketing their products with the threat of fines if they violated the agreement. A final decision on the penalties is expected in the coming weeks after a public comment period ends.","The trade commission’s treatment of the companies has angered Democratic lawmakers, who are urging the Trump administration to pursue tougher punishments for companies that profit by producing products in China and falsely labeling them as American-made.","“We call on the commission to do more to protect American manufacturers and consumers,” a group of senators wrote to the F.T.C. last month. Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin asked the agency to “provide specific insights about the commission’s decision to seek no consequences in these brazen instances of fraudulently labeling goods as ‘Made in the USA.’”","From the campaign trail to the White House, Mr. Trump has directed much of his focus to rebuilding American jobs and industries. In April 2017, Mr. Trump signed a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order, with the goal of promoting the use of “American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.”","Mr. Trump has put a particular focus on revitalizing American manufacturing, which he says has been decimated by cheap Chinese labor and materials.",That has Democrats questioning why the agency is not being more aggressive in going after American companies that manufacture their goods in China.,"“Many companies that manufacture at home are already treading water,” Rohit Chopra, a Democratic F.T.C. commissioner who disagreed with the decision, said in an interview. “American companies shouldn’t lose out to corporate cheaters who lie on their labels.”","Mr. Brown, who is considering running for president, said the agency’s penalty did not match the severity of the companies’ behavior.","“If companies that break our laws do not face financial penalties, then our American manufacturers are severely undermined,” Mr. Brown said. “We need stronger enforcement by the F.T.C. and greater transparency when it comes to the commission’s actions to crack down on these violators.”","Some agency officials, including one of its two Democratic commissioners, defended the settlement, saying that the threat of future penalties was a strong deterrent. The companies face a $40,000 penalty per violation if they are caught making false claims again. And officials said the agency did not seek monetary relief, in part, because there was no “price premium,” meaning the goods were not more expensive than similar products sold by competitors, who also imported their products but did not falsely label them as American-made.","“In our view, a thoughtful review and forward-looking plan is a more effective and efficient use of commission resources than reopening and relitigating the cases before us today,” Joseph J. Simons, the F.T.C. chairman, and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner, wrote in a statement in September.","But at least one company has complained to the commission, alleging in a letter that the backpack manufacturer’s misleading claim cost it lucrative contracts.","“Sandpiper caused confusion to at least one organizational buyer at the Army and Air Force Exchange Service looking for ‘Made in the USA’ products,” Alan Watts, a lawyer representing a competing company, Advantus, wrote to the commission in October. “This caused a very real unfair competitive disadvantage to Advantus whose compliance with the law caused it to lose sales.”","The F.T.C. has a long history of weak enforcement in “Made in America” cases that preceded Mr. Trump’s tenure. The commission lists on its website 26 “Made in America” cases it has reviewed since 1999. In some of those cases, companies have agreed to a monetary settlement. In 2016, for instance, Chemence, a specialty chemical company, agreed to pay $220,000 to resolve an agency lawsuit. But in many other cases, the settlements required only record-keeping and reporting requirements to make sure companies did not violate the law again.","The commission first found out about the false “Made in America” claims made by the four companies in question now through a dedicated complaint line, according to James Kohm, associate director of the enforcement division for the Bureau of Consumer Protection.","Mr. Kohm, in an interview, noted that Patriot Pucks went out of business shortly after the F.T.C.’s first ruling in September, and that Sandpiper, one of the tactical gear manufacturers, was sold to a new owner last fall while the company was involved in litigation with the commission.","“We’ve reached a preliminary agreement, whereby the company has not been required to admit any liability,” said a lawyer representing Piper Gear, the second tactical gear maker. He said he could not comment further because the settlement was not final.","After a public comment period, which included the questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the commission is expected to issue a final notice on the cases in the coming weeks. The senators, along with Mr. Chopra, are pressing to change the settlement to further penalize the wrongdoers.","“The commission should consider remedies tailored to the individual circumstances of the fraud, including redress and notice for consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, opt-in return programs, or admissions of wrongdoing,” Mr. Chopra wrote in a dissenting statement."
Who’s Investigating Justin Trudeau — and What Do They Hope to Find? - The New York Times,"In Canada, the House of Commons’ justice committee generally goes about its work in earnest obscurity.

Arriving in the midst of a federal election campaign, the fax exploded like a bomb. Mr. Goodale was cleared; a public servant in the finance department later pleaded guilty to insider trading charges.","An investigation later found no fault with the police force, but the Mounties were widely criticized as having meddled in politics.

The arena is normally a venue for concerts and hockey games.","Among the law enforcement personnel driven to emotion was Colonel John Cote, the chief of the Maine State Police. Cote said Campbell ""helped others see the light in some of our darkest days"" with his warm smile and cheerful attitude.

A Tennis Wish List for 2019 - The New York Times,Not much head scratching is required when it comes to deciding how to start a wish list for tennis in 2019.,A sport that has long been concerned about punching below its weight spent too much of last year elbowing itself in the ribs as its too-numerous leaders traded blows and crossed purposes.,"This is no way to run a niche sport concerned about market and mind share in a ruthlessly competitive global entertainment landscape. Improvement is all the more urgent with tennis’s biggest stars, Roger Federer and Serena Williams, both 37.","And so with a new season about to get serious with the start of the Australian Open on Monday, my No. 1 wish for tennis is unity. In an ideal world, that would mean unified governance.","“It will never happen, but what we need more than anything is a commissioner,” said Brad Gilbert, the longtime player, coach and analyst.","That would require each of tennis’s seven governing bodies to cede some of its authority, a situation that would probably require an existential threat to the game’s viability or profitability.","In an imperfect but still better world, unity could also mean a genuine players’ union — why not men and women together while we’re wishing? — that could make for more meaningful progress on tennis’s now-intractable issues through tough negotiations with those who own and operate the tournaments.","In the current system, the players and regular tour events are in partnership, an unusual arrangement in professional sports that can make consensus and change difficult.","Novak Djokovic, back at No. 1 and president of the ATP Player Council, has explored the concept. But for now, a union appears to be wishful thinking: too many legal and logistical hurdles.",But the sport can still do better at finding common ground in 2019.,"Start with agreeing on a more coherent schedule that does not include three men’s team events within less than four months: the Laver Cup in September 2019, the revamped Davis Cup in November 2019 and the revived ATP Cup in January 2020.",Continue by creating a meaningful mixed men’s and women’s team event that will carry on the legacy of the Hopman Cup. Further embrace tennis’s ability to showcase men’s and women’s stars in the same events — a longtime strength that other sports are interested in replicating.,Reach an agreement on coaching that will apply to all sectors of the pro game. The women’s tour currently allows on-court coaching visits once a set while the men’s tour and main-draw Grand Slam events do not allow any coaching during play.,"“If we have it, we should have it nonstop,” said Simona Halep, the women’s No. 1. “If we don’t, we should stop completely.”","Halep prefers letting players solve their own tactical and psychological issues under pressure, as do I and plenty of others. But the existing coaching situation is confusing to fans and disorienting to women’s players, who have to change routines in the tournaments that matter most. In light of the difficulty for umpires to fully police player-coach communication, perhaps allowing signals from the box and only the box is the right compromise.",More tennis wishes for 2019:,"ELIMINATE LETS ON SERVES A point or a tournament can already end with a net-cord winner during a rally when a groundstroke, volley or overhead hits the tape and trickles over. Why should a serve be treated any differently?

If a player chooses not to hit the ball once tossed, it should count as a missed serve. This will also speed play and, in making the ideal toss more elusive, take away a smidgen of a server’s advantage.","MAKE A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT to push tournaments to use balls from the same brands or at least with the same characteristics during the different surface swings: hard court, clay court, grass and indoor.

Trying to Change Pro Tennis One Signature at a Time - The New York Times,"TORONTO — In a subterranean food court in downtown Toronto, shoppers bustled past Maria Patrascu without a glance, unaware that the young woman sipping green tea was the leader of a growing rebellion in professional tennis.","A year ago at this time, Patrascu was a little-known left-hander playing obscure tournaments in Egypt as she tried to get her world ranking under 600. But now she is unable to enter tournaments because of controversial new International Tennis Federation rules designed to slash the ranks of pro players.","So instead of playing, Patrascu, 22, remains at home, seeking to upset the I.T.F.’s new World Tennis Tour one signature at a time. But what began as a petition has turned into a surging player revolt that Patrascu, more than any other player, has helped bring to light.","“It started out rebellious, but it has definitely evolved,” she said. “It’s just a movement to pursue justice.”","About 10 months ago, Patrascu began reading how the I.T.F., one of four governing bodies in tennis, planned to introduce a complicated string of rules to restructure the lower levels of the sport. Patrascu grew alarmed that she and hundreds of young players like her would find it far more difficult to get into tournaments and pursue a tennis career.","Last March, Patrascu started an online petition to halt the changes. For many months, it gathered only a modest response — about 2,400 signatures through December. But once the changes took effect in January and thousands of aspiring players felt the full force of the new rules, support for her petition soared.","It added more than 12,000 new signatures in just the last six weeks and now has more than 14,500. With Patrascu leading the way, supporters have already extracted one concession from the I.T.F., with more possibly on the way.","The movement continues to grow, and some players have met with lawyers to discuss a lawsuit against the I.T.F. Dave Miley, a former federation official and coach who has also opposed the new rules, praised Patrascu and the players and coaches who have joined the fight.","“What she and other players are doing is admirable, and they have cause,” Miley said. “To me, 14,000 voices out there are not uninformed.”","Professional tennis has several tiers, much like baseball with its major leagues and several levels of minor leagues below them. The best and most famous tennis players play in ATP or WTA tournaments. The rest, as many as 14,000 of them, toil anonymously around the globe in small events that are supposed to serve as tennis’s talent incubator.","Patrascu is one of those. Born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1997, she moved to Toronto with her parents when she was 5. She showed promise as a junior, winning the Canadian under-14 championship, and turned professional at 18. But her career-high ranking is No. 615 in the I.T.F. and No. 819 in the WTA.","Most players’ chances of making it to stardom are slim, and for many, it is challenging to just break even financially after paying for travel, training and other expenses. That is why the I.T.F., after commissioning an extensive study, declared the old structure unsustainable. Too many marginal players were basically masquerading as professionals.","The I.T.F.’s mission is to promote tennis around the world, and the organization works to ensure that there are tournaments on all continents. But those events have been open to all comers, and they have included players with little hope of breaking into the top tier — some of them over 50 years old. The I.T.F. study determined that in one year, as many as 6,000 so-called professional players did not earn even $1. A recent independent investigation also found that there was a “tsunami” of fixed matches at the lower levels, where players earning little prize money are vulnerable to betting syndicates.","The I.T.F. determined that the best model for professional tennis should include no more than 750 men and 750 women. It recommended new rules to restructure the tour, effectively eliminating almost 13,000 aspirants.","The new system is intended to provide an easier path for the top 100 juniors to matriculate via easier access to bigger tournaments, perhaps at the expense, opponents say, of other players who develop at later ages. (A certain number of spots are reserved at some events for the players in the top 100 junior rankings.) With a smaller pool of truly professional players, the I.T.F. hopes, the meager prize money and ranking points offered at the lower levels could be distributed more efficiently.","But Patrascu, and many others who are taking to various platforms to vent their anger, say that hard-working players with real potential are being caught up in the cull as tournament sizes are reduced and ranking points become more difficult to attain.",Patrascu said she received so many messages every day from frustrated players detailing their own problems with the new tour that she was unable to reply to them all.,"“They’re killing the players’ dreams, just to end up with a handful of really, really good players,” she said of the I.T.F. “All the rest are forgotten.”","In December, the I.T.F. granted Patrascu a one-hour conference call with the federation officials Jackie Nesbitt and Andrew Moss. Patrascu later said she felt she had let her fellow players down on that call, because she could not stop the new plan.","Then, in January, the new tour was introduced and Patrascu’s WTA ranking disappeared, she said. The most jarring change for most players is the limit on entrants for the qualifying rounds, the mini tournaments that allow fringe players to play their way into the main draws, where modest prize money and ranking points were up for grabs. These entries were cut to 24.","In the past, many tournaments had large qualifying draws of 48, 64 or even occasionally 128 players.","Patrascu explained how the changes in the size of qualifying draws have affected her boyfriend, Kevin Portmann of Italy, who went to a tournament in Tunisia last month and was required to play two pre-qualifying matches on the day he arrived. That was just to get into the qualifying rounds. She said she could not afford to travel to Africa or Europe for tournaments with little hope of reaching the main draw.","“You have to win five matches just to be in position to play someone who is totally fresh,” she said. “It’s not fair.”","Players are fuming because they now require more points to move up in the rankings, but it is harder to get into the tournaments to get those points. Also, doubles specialists are at a greater disadvantage because singles rankings are now used to determine entry into the doubles draws.","As the new reality sinks in, many players and their coaches, families and friends are turning to Patrascu’s petition. Some have followed her initiative with Facebook pages, like the one with a banner headline that reads, “Don’t Kill Tennis.” Rafael Nadal’s uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, who runs the player’s academy, spoke out against the new rules in an Instagram video this month.","The I.T.F. insisted that Patrascu’s petition contained “inaccuracies” and said that much of the other criticism had been “uninformed.” But, under siege, it made its first amendment to the new rules last month by expanding qualifying draws to 32 players. The federation also promised to continue monitoring the rules and to act accordingly.","“Of course we are listening to the players,” said Kris Dent, the I.T.F.’s senior executive director for pro circuits. “It would be foolish not to listen to our constituents. Change is never easy, but in this case it is vital.”","Patrascu said she was encouraged by the revision but said it should only be the start. Meanwhile, her days are spent training indoors in Toronto and stoking the budding rebellion.","“I don’t feel like I’m doing this for myself, especially because I’m not sure where my career is headed,” she said. “The time that I’ve dedicated to it is really from the bottom of my heart. I wish players could have more opportunities.”"
Where Have All the American Tennis Tournaments Gone? - The New York Times,"The United States Clay Court Championships, a men’s tennis tournament that ended Sunday in Houston, signaled something beyond the transition from the hardcourt season to clay.","It marked the end of the tennis tours’ two-month American swing, which featured six tournaments, including two of the biggest tournaments outside of the four Grand Slam events — the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., and the Miami Open.","As the ATP and WTA Tours shift to the red clay and grass courts of Europe, the next major events in the United States won’t come until the hardcourt season in July in the lead-up to the United States Open.","And after the U.S. Open wraps up in early September, the tennis tours depart again, spending much of end of the season in Asia.","American tennis fans used to have more options. In 1990, 24 of 55 WTA events were in the United States. But with the sale of the Connecticut Open in New Haven this year, only seven of 55 WTA events currently on the 2019 calendar are on American soil. Five of those seven are joint events with men, including the U.S. Open, Indian Wells and Miami.","On the men’s side, 16 of 77 worldwide ATP events in 1990 took place in the United States. This year, 11 of 63 will be.","At one time, both the men’s and women’s year-end tour finals were played at Madison Square Garden, but now the men’s event takes place in London and the women’s is in Shenzhen, China. Smaller tournaments in the United States have had trouble selling enough tickets and sponsorships to stay financially viable. And there was even some concern that the Miami Open, which was looking for a new stadium site last year, might be lured out of the country.","“I don’t think that we will ever become a U.S.-centric tour again,” said Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA. “I think there’s certainly room for growth for a couple more events, but I think the growth will be in that the events that are here in the States will continue to get bigger. But I do think that we have moved to having a global footprint versus being focused primarily in one country.”","Simon said that the WTA planned to introduce two new events in the United States, one beginning this year and another in 2020, both of which will take place the week before the U.S. Open. The location of the 2019 tournament, which would bring the total of WTA events in the country to eight, is expected to be announced in May.",The decline in the number of American tournaments over the last three decades corresponds with the decline in the number of Americans atop the world rankings — especially on the men’s side — and the growth of tennis in Europe and Asia.,"In December 1990, seven of the top 20 men’s players in the world were Americans, including household names like Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang and John McEnroe.","The current rankings feature only John Isner at No. 10 among the top 20, followed by Frances Tiafoe at No. 29. They are the only American men in the top 50, and no American man has won a Grand Slam event since Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open in 2003. Since then, Europeans, led by Switzerland’s Roger Federer, Spain’s Rafael Nadal and Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, have won 59 of the 61 major titles.",Women’s tournaments fled the United States even though Serena and Venus Williams were dominant players over the past 20 years and are the reason many current American players took up tennis.,"With more than half of the world’s population in Asia, the WTA looked to that continent as a pillar of growth, said Stacey Allaster, the chief executive of professional tennis for the United States Tennis Association and a former leader of the WTA.","In 1990, there were only four WTA tournaments in Asia. This season there are 11 in China alone, part of a tennis boom fueled by the success of Li Na.","“I don’t think it’s about the quantity of events” in the United States, Allaster said. “We need successful events.”","And for smaller tournaments, being successful can be tough.","When Anne Worcester, the tournament director of the Connecticut Open, realized the tournament was no longer economically viable, she attempted to find a new title sponsor for the event in New Haven.","She considered offers from various American cities, but ultimately sold the tournament to the highest bidder, APG, a sports and entertainment company with a strong footprint in Asia. This year, the tournament, which used to be held the week before the U.S. Open, will be in Zhengzhou, China, the week after the Open.","“It has been very emotional to let go of something that I’ve birthed and nurtured for 21 years,” said Worcester, who was the chief executive of the WTA from 1994 to ’98. “My kids are 21 and 23, so it was really like having a third child. But the economics were so clear and because I was leading the charge to secure a title sponsor as well as cultivate bidders around the world, I just saw the writing on the wall. As much as our board didn’t want to sell, there was just no choice.”","Worcester said it was hard to sell tickets and sponsorships in part because there were fewer American stars to promote. The Connecticut Open in recent years has featured European stars like Simona Halep, Petra Kvitova and Caroline Wozniacki.","“In this global sport of tennis, it’s not easy to promote non-Americans,” Worcester said. “Americans want to see Americans.”","She remembered her time as the director of worldwide operations for the Virginia Slims Tour, which began in 1970, organized by Billie Jean King and backed by the Philip Morris company.","“Just in the United States of America, Virginia Slims had 17 named tournaments in the major markets of the United States,” Worcester said. “And women’s tennis was filling arenas, indoor and outdoors. It was a very different era, a very different economy, a different product. There were more American players that were on a first-name basis with the world.”","The bleeding may have stopped on WTA events leaving the United States. Interest was high in the New Haven event, Worcester said, because global bidders knew that a tournament of its caliber would not be sold again for a long time.","When the men’s Memphis Open faced declining profit and failed to secure a title sponsor several years ago, Josh Ripple feared the event might be purchased by a company that would move the tournament outside the United States.","Ripple, a former president of the WTA Tour, is the executive vice president of GF Sports, a New York-based events company that owns and operates several pro sports events.","In 2015, an affiliate of GF Sports purchased the tournaments in Memphis and Atlanta from the U.S.T.A. and committed to not letting them leave the United States, Ripple said.","After speaking with representatives from Nashville; Columbus, Ohio; Seattle; Dallas; and Phoenix, Ripple and his company moved the Memphis event in 2018 to the renovated Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, where it was held in February. (The Racquet Club in Memphis, which hosted the tournament for 40 years, is closing this spring and will be turned into a hotel and apartment complexes.)","“Hopefully, it can have a nice long stay in New York,” Isner said, adding that he liked “playing in the United States as much as possible.”","Patrick McEnroe, an ESPN analyst, said that the major American events like the U.S. Open, Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati are stronger and more popular than ever but that the lower-level events like the New York Open might continue to face difficulties.","“To me, the only way that those can get back to being consistently viable year after year is if at the top we have more American tennis players close to the top that have personality that can sell some tickets,” he said."
Whistleblower Spurned by Players for Exposing Tennis Crooks - The New York Times,"ORDINO, Andorra — As a brave whistleblower, Marco Trungelliti should be feeling good about himself. The Argentine player exposed match-fixing crooks in tennis, helped the fight against the criminal gambling syndicates that are corroding his sport from within and testified about dishonest fellow professionals who, in part thanks to his evidence, are now banned.","But instead, the 29-year-old says doing the right thing cost him dearly. Ranked No. 139, he's one of the few players so established in the sport willing to speak frankly about the fixers who pay athletes to lose so they can profit from bets on the crooked results. The price of Trungelliti's honesty has been rejection by other players and stress that hurt his health and his game.","Compounding his unhappiness, Trungelliti also feels he's been left out to dry by tennis administrators and their anti-corruption investigators. Having pumped him for evidence, he says they failed to publicly defend him against those in tennis who muddied his name, questioned his motives for giving evidence and labeled him a rat.","""They just used me,"" he says. ""They just dropped me in the middle of the sea.""","""It was a disaster, disaster. In my opinion, it was one of the worst procedures that I have ever seen,"" he adds. ""I'm still paying the price.""","Trungelliti caused a sensation at the French Open last year when he, his younger brother, mother and 88-year-old grandmother squeezed into a rental car and dashed 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from Spain to Roland Garros so he could fill a ""lucky loser"" spot at the Grand Slam tournament that opened at the last minute when injured players withdrew.","What few knew at the time was that behind his easy smile, thick curls and feel-good 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 first-round victory against Australian Bernard Tomic, Trungelliti was shouldering a weighty secret: He'd been a key witness in a match-fixing probe that snared three fellow Argentines, testifying even though he knew that, back in Argentina, he'd likely face a backlash for doing so.","Best-known of the three was Nicolas Kicker, at No. 84, the highest-ranked player convicted so far of fixing matches. The Tennis Integrity Unit, the sport's anti-corruption body with 17 full-time staffers, an annual budget of nearly $5 million and veteran ex-police investigators, announced Kicker's guilt just three days before the French Open, where he had been preparing to play. Neither the TIU nor Trungelliti gave even the slightest hint at the time of the role he'd played.","In the aftermath, however, Trungelliti noticed player attitudes changing toward him. Even some he regarded as friends asked why he didn't keep his mouth shut.","""No one was saying 'Hi' any more. No one was looking at me,"" he says. ""It's sad.""","Contacted by The Associated Press, the TIU said it couldn't comment because of its ""long-standing confidentiality policy with regard to disciplinary hearings and witness evidence.""","Behind the scenes, Trungelliti has repeatedly contacted the unit, asking without success for it to defend him.","""Due to my participation in the trial, I receive all kinds of insults from players to managers,"" he emailed the TIU last August. ""They are trying soil my honor.""","Trungelliti's wife, Nadir, says there were times when the stress reduced him to tears. When he was playing, he just wanted to be home. He smashed rackets. A back injury flared again.",But he's not shutting up.,Trungelliti says match-fixing is an open secret in the game and getting worse.,"""It's not just the players' problem,"" he says. ""There are a lot of coaches involved. A lot. A lot. More than we think.""","""If you are weak mentally, then you go in, you are all in, for sure, because it's easy money,"" he says. ""If you think about it, this is like one hour working for one hundred thousand dollars.""",The evidence bears him out.,"An investigation commissioned by tennis administrators concluded last December that betting-related corruption is ""particularly acute and pervasive"" at lower- and mid-level Futures and Challenger tournaments, below the top-tier ATP tour.","Gambling syndicates often target players who, unlike the sport's multi-millionaire stars, struggle to make a good living. In Belgium, prosecutors say they identified 137 mostly lower-level players , from more than a half-dozen countries, suspected of having worked with an Armenian-led gang rolled up last June that allegedly paid 500 to 3,000 euros ($570 to $3,400) for fixed matches and sets. Police say the syndicate employed mules, people hired for a few dollars to place bets small enough to slip under the radar of gambling watchdogs. Two other match-fixing operations were broken up in Spain , in June and October.","Trungelliti says he felt compelled to come forward when he was approached in July 2015 by a fixer who posed as a potential sponsor and was introduced via his coach. He wrote to the TIU, saying the fixer ""asked me to keep quiet.""","""But I can't because I hate this,"" he wrote. ""Can you please tell me what I can do? I have his name, his telephone number and a few things he told me.""","Those ""things"" proved explosive.","In a subsequent hour-long interview with a TIU investigator and in a four-page witness statement, Trungelliti meticulously detailed what he knew. He said the fixer laid out a sliding scale of bribes: $2,000 to $3,000 for fixed Futures matches; $5,000 to $10,000 in mid-level Challenger tournaments; $50,000 to $100,000 on the ATP tour where the biggest stars play.","The fixer said he paid cash and communicated using encrypted, easily deleted text messages. He reeled off players he said he'd fixed matches with. Three leapt out at Trungelliti, all Argentines: Kicker, Patricio Heras and Federico Coria.","The fixer was particularly ""proud"" of a Challenger match fixed in Italy with Kicker, Trungelliti told the TIU. Kicker lost 6-1, 6-2 in 63 minutes to South Korea's Duckhee Lee, then ranked 74 spots below Kicker, at No. 278.","Kicker is now serving a three-year ban, with the possibility of an additional three-year suspension hanging over him if he breaches anti-corruption rules again.","Heras, whose career-best ranking was No. 269 in 2013, also is banned for three years, with an additional two years suspended .","Coria was banned for two months, with another six months suspended, for failing to report that he was offered money in July 2015 to lose a set at a Futures tournament in Italy and for not telling the TIU of another approach a month later to lose several matches. The TIU specified that Coria hadn't actually taken money or fixed games. But the TIU investigator who questioned Coria testified there was evidence in his iPhone of contacts with the fixer who also sought to groom Trungelliti.",Whether the fixer is still operating is unclear. The TIU hasn't announced any sanctions against the fixer or said whether it shared Trungelliti's testimony about him with police.,"As painful as the whistleblowing process has been for Trungelliti, he says he'd go through it again if he had to. He says he reported a separate approach by another fixer in 2016.",His TIU witness statement neatly summed up his thinking.,"""I love tennis,"" he testified. ""I feel very saddened by the state of tennis and the fact that match-fixing is happening so often.""",___
Dan Evans Says He Threw Away His Tennis Career. He’s Trying to Get It Back. - The New York Times,"DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Dan Evans finished a practice session last month, grabbed a racket by the strings and marched from the court toward the player locker room.","It was the same path walked by Juan Martín del Potro the night before. For del Potro, a flash mob gathered as fans chanted “Olé, Olé, Olé, Delpo, Delpo,” and implored the popular Argentine to autograph photos, tennis balls, hats, T-shirts and even one man’s bald head.","When Evans walked the route, just hours before he was to take the court against Radu Albot in the final of the Delray Beach Open on Feb. 24, no one stopped him to chat or ask for his autograph. Not a single spectator recognized Evans, a 28-year-old Briton.",He was alone with his thoughts. But he was used to that.,"For more than a year, Evans spent most of his time alone after being barred from the ATP Tour for a positive drug test for cocaine. Evans said that while he used cocaine recreationally and out of competition, which is not prohibited in tennis, he tested positive during the Barcelona Open in April 2017 when he left some of the drug in a bag that contaminated other medication.","Evans, who was ranked a career-high No. 41 at the time of his ban, had recently reached his first career ATP final in Sydney. He did not appeal the charge.","The Delray Beach Open was only his fourth ATP Tour tournament since his return in April 2018. He lost the final to Albot in a third-set tiebreaker despite holding three match points, but his ranking is up to No. 100 as he begins the qualifying tournament for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., on Tuesday.","With no ability to play tournaments or train during the ban, Evans retreated to his home in Cheltenham on the outskirts of the picturesque Cotswolds, some 90 miles northwest of London. He was forbidden to even practice at any facilities affiliated with Britain’s Lawn Tennis Association for 10 months.","He filled his days quietly playing golf and watching television, though he refused to tune in to any tennis matches. He said he would not even follow tournament results in the newspaper. Some days, he said, it was too painful to leave the house.","“It was a really tough time in my life,” Evans said. “But there were a lot of other people around me who had a difficult year as well. I would be selfish to think that it didn’t affect everyone else in my life.","“Those feelings of anger and hurt at what you did to people don’t go away easily,” Evans added, referring to the pain and embarrassment he caused his family, his girlfriend and a bevy of coaches and supporters.","This was not the first time he had been penalized. In 2006, Evans was pulled from the Wimbledon junior tournament by the L.T.A., the national governing body the sport, for unacceptable on-court behavior. Two years later, he was suspended by the L.T.A. for four months after he was photographed during Wimbledon at a nightclub in the early morning hours. And in 2010, the L.T.A. stopped financially supporting him for underperformance and a poor attitude.","Evans was unranked when he returned from this latest suspension in April 2018 and was forced to start at the lower levels of professional tennis. With no points to defend, and little compassion from his fellow competitors, Evans began entering Challengers, tennis’s version of the minor leagues. He often had to play three matches just to get into the tournament’s main draw. But in August he won a Challenger in Vancouver, British Columbia, and reached the final of another in France in February.","At the ATP Tour level, he was given a wild card to play the event at Queen’s Club in London in June and lost his first match. He tried to qualify for Wimbledon last year, reaching the second round. He qualified for the main draw of this year’s Australian Open and lost to Roger Federer in the second round. His breakthrough at Delray Beach included wins over No. 9 John Isner and No. 35 Frances Tiafoe.","“In retrospect, his journey has been incredibly quick for someone with no ranking,” said David Felgate, Tim Henman’s longtime coach, who began working with Evans just after his return. “Dan doesn’t expect anything from anyone; he doesn’t expect sympathy. He knows what he did to himself. But it does give him a different perspective and may prolong his career. When you realized you missed a year, you want to make up for it. You want this career to go on for a long time because you know what not playing felt like.”","At 5-foot-9, Evans lacks the serving power of tennis’s taller players like del Potro, who is 6-6. But Evans is scrappy off the ground, particularly with his running forehand pass down the line. He also possesses an effective one-handed slice backhand. And he loves to volley, just as his countryman Henman did.","As far as he has come over the last year, he knows he has still got a long way to go.","“Listen, that episode in my life of being banned, it’s over,” Evans said. “Everyone forgave me as soon as I held my hands up and accepted the blame. But it’s not easy to be happy with yourself day in and day out when the fact is, I was No. 41 in the world and I threw it all away.”","He added: “But to say that I’ve grown, that would be justifying it. There’s no sort of philosophical looking back on it. It was the worst thing ever. Now, I’m just back trying to win tennis matches.”"
"Board Meetings, Not Backhands, Are the Talk of Men’s Tennis - The New York Times","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Novak Djokovic played his first official tennis match in more than a month on Saturday night, defeating the American Bjorn Fratangelo in straight sets at the BNP Paribas Open.",But Djokovic has hardly been taking an extended break from official tennis business.,"Back at No. 1 in the world by a hefty margin, he is also wielding his renewed clout off court as president of the ATP player council. As a result of his maneuvering, the men’s tour is in need of a new chief executive along with some collective purpose and peace of mind, which are likely to remain more elusive than Djokovic and his allies might like.","As ever, the tension is between the players, who understandably want to maximize their earnings in a brutally competitive sport, and their paymasters, who own and operate the tournaments and understandably would rather keep prize money under tight rein. But the unusual and inconvenient thing in men’s tennis is that the players and paymasters are part of the same internally conflicted organization: the ATP.","“We are really blocked,” said Gilles Simon, the French player and a former council member. “The structure works against us and the imbalance being already there between the tournaments and the players, the imbalance endures.”","Acrimony is inevitable. Progress is not. Last week, Djokovic and the players appeared to send a strong message when the player representatives on the ATP Tour’s board of directors voted against extending the contract of Chris Kermode, the ATP’s executive chairman and president, who will now be obliged to step down at the end of 2019.","But such a political power play is only intimidating if the players are truly united, which seems far from the case.","The player council, in a nonbinding vote before the board meeting, could not reach agreement on whether to recommend or reject Kermode’s extension.","In an age of constant communication, the biggest stars are somehow struggling to connect. Roger Federer, a former president of the player council, said Sunday that he had reached out to Djokovic before the vote only to be told that Djokovic could not squeeze him in.","“That’s hard to understand for me,” Federer said.","Rafael Nadal, a supporter of Kermode and continuity, said his cellphone was primed and ready, but no calls or texts came his way.",This sounds more like high school than a global professional sport.,"“They are representing us, so normally they have to ask, what’s our opinion? Not in every small decision, but in big decisions,” Nadal said. “In my opinion, this one was a big decision.”",The players and the tournaments each have three representatives on the ATP board of directors. The chairman — Kermode since 2014 — has the ability to cast a tiebreaking vote but would prefer to avoid it when possible for fear of endangering support from one side of the divide.,"It is a difficult dance even in the best of circumstances, and Kermode seems to have stepped on the wrong feet.","Djokovic did not vote him out. That was up to the player representatives that he and the player council have supported or voted into place: David Egdes, a Tennis Channel executive; Alex Inglot, the director of communications at Sportradar; and Justin Gimelstob, the Tennis Channel commentator and former American player, who remains the most polarizing back-room figure in the sport and has remained in place despite facing felony battery charges.","Under the ATP’s voting system, Kermode needed majority support (at least two votes) from each camp to continue. He received all three of the tournament representatives’ votes but apparently failed to get any of the player representatives’ votes.","In a letter to ATP staff last week after his ouster, Kermode said it was “ironic” that he was leaving after “the players have achieved some of the greatest gains in the history of the ATP Tour in the past five years.”","Kermode, a former low-level pro player and high-level tournament director, is a polished and genial Briton who knows how to work a room but apparently not every boardroom.","Running the ATP Tour is a compromised position to begin with; the real power in tennis lies with the four Grand Slam tournaments, which function independently. Still, he navigated his position of weakness for more than five years, securing sponsorships and a hard-won prize money increase from the top tier of ATP tournaments.","He also led the creation of new events like the Next Gen ATP Finals, designed to promote young players like 19-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov, who will eventually have to step out of the ink-black shadow cast by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.","“From what I know of Chris, he was unbelievable,” Shapovalov said.",But clearly not everyone is in the Kermode fan club.,"He is seen by some of the players as a “tournament guy,” a characterization he rejects. Others grumble about his handling of the ATP Cup, which will be relaunched in the opening week of the 2020 season in Australia.","With the new-look Davis Cup using a similar format, Kermode tried to avoid a team-event glut by working toward a combined event. But he was overruled last year by the players.","There is also criticism that he did not secure more prize money gains, above all from the four Grand Slam events. As council president, Federer once spearheaded a successful push for major increases, but with Grand Slam revenues growing, the concern is that prize money has not kept pace.","Federer and Nadal could re-enter the fray. They talked tennis governance over coffee at Federer’s rented house here last week. But for now, it is the 31-year-old Djokovic’s turn to lead on court and off. He is multitasking at a point in his career when family time is ever more important to him and when he is again on the verge of holding all four of the Grand Slam singles titles.","Why bother with tennis politics at this stage?, I asked him.","“I tend to ask that myself, as well,” he said with a grin. “But I feel that it is my responsibility, in a way, as a top player to contribute to the sport in that way, as well.”","Even if he charts a steadier course in the months to come, putting a more “player friendly” ATP chief in place looks all but impossible with the tournament representatives effectively possessing veto power on the board.","Changing the governance structure, as Djokovic has suggested, sounds nearly as tricky.","Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia and a driving force in the Australian Open’s growth, would be a strong ATP leader and has been interested in the chief executive post in the past.","But with mutual trust at low ebb and no player union in sight, it is likely a compromise candidate will take over.","Sure, tennis needs change and fresh ideas. But when you tear down a building, it seems best to have a clear idea what will stand in its place."
Down and Out of Tennis at 22. Back at 28. - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — For the first point she played at a Grand Slam event in six years, Rebecca Marino hit an ace.","She celebrated with a subtle fist pump, determined to have the best next act she could after a lengthy intermission during which she became the face of depression among athletes.","“It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, just going from tournament to tournament now,” Marino said. “But if I stop and think about it, then that’s when I see that it’s pretty cool that I was able to do this, and to get this far, from no ranking to suddenly in the qualies of a Slam.”","Marino lost, 6-2, 6-2, to Caroline Dolehide on Tuesday in the first round of Australian Open qualifying, limited by a back injury, which curtailed her off-season training. Despite her stiffness, Marino, 28, showed flashes of the power and clean ball-striking that sent her into the upper echelons of tennis seven years ago.","With a percussive forehand and a booming serve that topped out at 120 miles per hour, Marino surged to a high of 38th in the rankings in the summer of 2011, when she was 20. Not a highly touted junior prospect, she had planned to enroll in college before her tennis successes mounted, catapulting her faster and further than she was prepared to handle.","“Not expecting it, I felt like I was thrown into this machine, and I didn’t understand how it worked,” she said.","Marino stepped back from the sport for the first time in 2012, taking seven months off. After returning for several months, she retired in February 2013 at age 22.","In a conference call announcing her decision, Marino revealed her struggles with depression; days earlier, she had discussed her social media abuse in an interview with The New York Times. Her leaving the sport was often attributed to one of those factors, or both of them, which Marino said was inaccurate in retrospect.","“When I look back, I wouldn’t necessarily say it was depression,” she said of her decision to stop playing. “It was burnout, and it was expectations put on my shoulders by myself and others, and I just wasn’t able to cope. It kind of all came to a head in a big, giant burnout, I guess.”","Though her absence was longer than most, Marino is not the only player to have stepped away from the sport because of burnout. Most notably, the top Australian Ash Barty took off nearly two years early in her career. Barty has become a top player in her return, and she defeated No. 1 Simona Halep in Sydney this week.","For Marino, stepping away from tennis made her “able to become superhappy and enjoy my life,” she said. ","Marino’s retirement at 22 generated considerable attention, particularly in her native Canada, where she was one of the brightest tennis prospects in generations. ","Her story resonated with others, but she felt uneasy being a touchstone for athletes struggling with depression. ","“It wasn’t something I was prepared for, and it’s still something I’m kind of grappling with,” Marino said. “I’m still a really private person, and so for people to come up to me and tell me all of the things they’ve dealt with, or how I’ve affected them, it’s difficult sometimes, because I don’t really know what to say. Even though I’m happy that I’ve helped people, it can be overwhelming because I’m not professionally trained to help people.”","After retiring from tennis, Marino worked one summer for her family’s construction business, pouring cement and digging through clay. She later began teaching tennis lessons and enrolled at the University of British Columbia, where she studied English literature. The works she enjoyed most, she said, were ones from the Victorian era that grappled with the effects of industrialization on society.","In her second year, the university’s rowing coach recruited her to join the team, knowing her athletic background and her family’s extensive history in the sport. (Her uncle George Hungerford was an Olympic gold medalist in 1964.) Rowing improved Marino’s fitness and helped expand her sense of identity.","“To have a competitive outlet through a team like that was superfun,” she said. “It made me feel like I was a part of the university community. People didn’t look at me for my tennis anymore; they just looked at me as a student-athlete.”","Marino was shaken in February 2017 when her father, Joe, received a prostate cancer diagnosis.","“After he finished chemo, I kind of took a step back and wanted to look at what was important in my life,” she said. “I didn’t want to live with any regrets, and I thought that tennis was the one thing in my life that I kind of wish I had a do-over for.”","She also wanted her father to see her play again. Marino weighed the idea of a return for months and gained confidence after serving as a hitting partner at a tournament in Vancouver, her hometown, in August 2017. ","A week before her next semester was to begin, Marino pulled out of her classes, quit her coaching job and moved to Montreal to begin working toward a full-fledged comeback at Tennis Canada’s training center.","After a false start because she did not re-enter tennis’s antidoping program in time, Marino returned to the sport at its lowest rung last January, at a series of small tournaments in Turkey. She won her first 19 matches, including her first 30 sets. She worked throughout the year to bring her ranking to its current spot of 216th, which was enough to reach her goal of entering the Australian Open qualifying draw.","Marino plans a long stay in the sport this time, and is working to ensure it is more pleasant and sustainable. She stays in better contact with friends, including more trips home to Vancouver, to help her keep one foot outside the sometimes suffocating tennis bubble.","“My friends don’t play tennis, so they don’t care if I win or lose,” she said. “They’re just concerned about how I’m doing as a person, if I’m enjoying myself, and when I’ll be back so we can hang out. My whole structure this time around is a little bit different, and I have a lot of things outside of tennis that keep me grounded.”","She added: “Previously, I felt like my identity was just ‘tennis player.’ But now I have many things that form my identity, and I feel like I’m very whole and very balanced.”",Marino hopes her triumphs off and on the court gain the same amount of attention as her rough times did. She wants people to see her as a real person instead of a headline.,"“I have no doubts in my mind that I’m able to compete and be here,” Marino said. “I’m not going to ever go back to that place again because I know who I am now, and I know what I need to do.”"
Bianca Andreescu Is Rising in the Tennis Rankings Ahead of Schedule - The New York Times,"INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Ranked No. 178 at the end of last season, the Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu set an ambitious goal for herself, it seemed: Climb high enough in the rankings to be able to get into the main draw of this year’s second Grand Slam event, the French Open, in May.",Time for a new goal.,"“So quickly, like everything is happening so quickly!” she exclaimed late Friday evening as she sat for an interview as a surprise finalist in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.","Her run here at age 18 as an unseeded wild card has been a revelation, featuring a 6-0, 6-1 demolition of the former No. 1 Garbiñe Muguruza in the quarterfinals and a grueling 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory over sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina in the semifinals on Friday.","Now ranked 60th, she is the first wild card to reach the final of this top-tier women’s tournament, going one round further than Martina Hingis in 2006 and Serena Williams in 2015.",That is pretty fair tennis company.,"“Thoughts? So many thoughts,” she said, putting both hands to her head. “Another goal of mine was to make history, and I just did. It’s incredible.”","Tennis remains a brutally competitive individual sport, in which health, confidence and emotional balance can prove precarious, particularly when a young star emerges in a hurry.","For now, Andreescu has won just one round in a Grand Slam singles tournament, when she qualified for this year’s Australian Open after a surprise run to the final in Auckland. But her breakthrough this season does not look like a fluke. She has the varied all-court game and precise, athletic footwork to give purists goose bumps. And her fighting spirit and open personality should speak to a wider audience, too.","“She is playing with a combination of freedom and fearless determination; I hope she can hold on to this,” said Sven Groeneveld, the experienced Dutch coach who has helped Mary Pierce, Ana Ivanovic and, most recently, Maria Sharapova win major titles.","The next hurdle for Andreescu is a big one: eighth-seeded Angelique Kerber, a former No. 1 and three-time Grand Slam singles champion, in Sunday’s final.","“In the third set against Svitolina, I told myself, ‘I’m going to stick to my tactics and just go for it,’” Andreescu said. “So that’s what I did, and that’s what I’ve been doing for the last couple of months. This is my first time actually on the tour playing against such high-level athletes, so I really have nothing to lose, and in the final as well I have nothing to lose. I’m just going to go out there and believe in myself because anything is possible.”","Andreescu, born to Romanian parents in the Toronto suburb Mississauga, is part of a new wave of gifted Canadian teenagers with flashy games, immigrant families and potential Grand Slam titles in their future.","It includes Denis Shapovalov, the 19-year-old with the leaping, one-handed backhand who is ranked No. 25 in the men’s game, and Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, who turned heads here in Indian Wells by upsetting 10th-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round.","This comes after the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard broke into the top five at age 20 after a phenomenal 2014, including a run to the Wimbledon final. But Bouchard fell back quickly and is ranked 73rd at age 25. Though she has shown signs of resurgence, she is also a cautionary tale after struggling to manage new expectations, albeit with a more limited tennis skill set than Andreescu’s.","Keeping Andreescu grounded as her prospects soar is her team’s goal, and her own goal, too.","“It’s easy to get distracted,” said her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, the head of women’s tennis at Tennis Canada. “But it’s going to be part of my work to make sure she stays in the moment.”","Andreescu does her part by spending 15 minutes each morning doing what she calls “creative visualization”: imagining herself experiencing the situations she will face on court and off so she will be better equipped to manage them if and when they come. Many elite athletes rely on visualization, including the world’s best women’s Alpine skier, Mikaela Shiffrin.","“I used to do hours and hours of it, but I found that 15 minutes has really helped me, and it’s not time-consuming at all,” Andreescu said. “It’s something I got online from a course. My mom introduced it to me when I was 13, and I have been doing it ever since.”","Andreescu’s parents moved to Canada in 1994. Her mother, Maria, has a master’s degree in economics; her father, Nicu, is a mechanical engineer.","“We arrived in Canada with two suitcases, and that’s all,” Nicu Andreescu told The Globe and Mail. “We had a great first impression when we arrived, having come from a former communist country. We wanted to go to Canada and start a new life and have a better future for any kids we might have.”","Bianca is their only child, and though she developed her game under the umbrella of Tennis Canada, the sport’s governing body there, she said she took her first tennis lesson at age 7 in Romania, where her mother had moved back temporarily for a business opportunity.","That lesson was on clay (bring on Roland Garros), and though her family was soon reunited in Canada, Andreescu has retained strong ties to Romania. Simona Halep, the Romanian star, was one of her two main tennis role models along with Kim Clijsters.",Andreescu speaks Romanian with her parents and attributes her combativeness on court to her “Romanian roots.”,"“I think we are very passionate, and we leave it all out there,” she said. “It’s all heart.”","She has shown plenty of grit in Indian Wells, rallying in the first round to beat the Romanian player Irina-Camelia Begu, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3, on the tournament’s second biggest show court.","“I actually thought I was going to lose,” she said. “I was really nervous.”","She experienced back pain in that match, which has been a recurring problem and was still troubling her late Friday night as she repeatedly shifted position in her chair during an interview after the duel with Svitolina.","“I have a lot of weakness in my core, so that’s definitely something I’m improving on,” said Andreescu, who has also missed significant court time with a stress fracture in her foot.","On Friday against Svitolina, she had to fight through leg cramps in the final set, in which she managed to convert her fourth match point — mixing drop shots with big, bold groundstrokes as she constructed points down the stretch.","Though tennis stars are trending taller, Andreescu is 5-foot-7. But she has powerful legs that help her generate tremendous pace when she needs it with both her midcourt forehand and her two-handed backhand and to leap high off the ground when serving. Her second serve, unlike for many players of her size, is not a weakness.","Though she has abundant power and world-class mobility, what separates her from the pack is her ability to change pace. She can lob and generate acute angles with off-speed groundstrokes. She looks comfortable attacking the net and has a solid overhead, which she had to prove repeatedly against Svitolina, a premier defender.",Andreescu fearlessly uses the whole canvas.,"“I love that,” she said of the description. “No one has ever said that about my game before, but that definitely describes it, I think. I like to hit every shot in the book.”","She is now 2-0 against top-10 players after upsetting Caroline Wozniacki in January in Auckland, where she also defeated Venus Williams.","The victory over Williams moved her to tears. “Venus is a walking, living, breathing legend,” Andreescu said.","But though the emotions were powerful again on Friday night, beating her tour elders is fast becoming a habit. Andreescu will be ranked in the top 35 on Monday and will break into the top 25 if she defeats Kerber. Instead of merely making it into the French Open draw, she now has a fine chance of being seeded.","“I do believe that I deserve to be here,” she said sotto voce as the interview ended. “But I didn’t expect for it to come so quickly. But I mean, it’s better sooner than later, right? So I can’t complain. It’s just been crazy. I’m so grateful. I never want to take anything for granted. It was so nice to meet you.”"
"In Women’s Tennis, Finesse Can Fight Power - The New York Times","Another season of Grand Slam tennis begins at the Australian Open on Monday, but Agnieszka Radwanska, who retired in November, won’t be part of it.","Aptly called “The Ninja” for her ability to inflict out-of-nowhere pain on the opposition from all manner of contortionist positions, Radwanska’s spectacular, poker-faced shotmaking will be missed.","But even without its Ninja, the women’s game is in a memorable phase when it comes to entertainment value and players with an uncommon touch.","At the moment and probably not for long, the tour is a clash of generations with Serena Williams, 37, and Venus Williams, 38, still in the mix along with midcareer champions like Angelique Kerber, 30, and Caroline Wozniacki, 28, and the new wave led by Naomi Osaka, 21, the Japanese sensation who upset Serena Williams to win the United States Open last year. It is rare to see such a range of players clashing with the outcomes so uncertain.","The tour has geographical breadth with players from the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia all in the top 20 and with Ons Jabeur, 24, of Tunisia in the top 60 after last year, becoming the first Arab woman to reach a WTA final.","But there is another strong and too often undervalued selling point: stylistic variety. Though serious baseline power remains the most popular and fail-safe route to stardom, players with subtler, more creative games are also finding a way to win consistently, just as Radwanska, a former world No. 2 and Wimbledon finalist, did before her injuries.","Several of these tennis “artists” will be seeded at the Australian Open: No. 10 Daria Kasatkina of Russia, No. 13 Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia, No. 15 Ashleigh Barty of Australia, and No. 28 Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan, a 33-year-old whose double-handed, frequently off-speed strokes are as crafty as they come. There is also Jabeur, still an outsider but whose game is a crowd-pleasing mix of baseline punch, feathery touch and Federer-esque flourishes.","“There will always be exceptions to the power players,” said Paul McNamee, the former Australian men’s star who advises Hsieh. “The players you refer to, however, all have one thing in common: exceptional hands. They have amazing touch, and this is why they can survive even if they have less raw power.”","That hardly means they have none. Barty, despite being 5-foot-5 and shorter than most of her rivals, generates the leg drive and racket-head speed to hit big serves and forehands. Her crisply sliced backhand has unusual bite, and she has perhaps the best net game in the sport.","“The plan to get to the net more often is a focus for 2019,” said Craig Tyzzer, her coach. “Ash certainly benefits from playing more doubles than most of the other singles girls, but her volley skills were certainly developed from an early age, which is a massive advantage.”",Kasatkina has a heavy topspin forehand that she can flatten out to create more pace when she requires it.,But what distinguishes the members of the WTA’s creative class from their peers is the size of their tool set and the range of their tactical options. Their success has meant more matchups that feature contrasting styles: important to the appeal of a game where patterns have a tendency to repeat.,"“Tennis is a game of chess, of tactics,” said Philippe Dehaes, Kasatkina’s coach, who has emerged as one of the tour’s leading mentors and motivators. “You have to vary zones and trajectories and find the answer suited to what your opponent is doing. To have women who play well tactically and who can keep the ball in play, while varying and creating, makes the show much more interesting for people, in my opinion.”","It is not the contrast that tennis once regularly offered. When Martina Navratilova was attacking the net in the 1970s and 1980s against her baseline-hugging archrival Chris Evert and others, the gulf between styles and tennis philosophies was much wider.","“When you had serve-and-volleyers going against baseliners, that was more of a complete and obvious contrast,” said Tracy Austin, the precocious champion who faced Navratilova frequently. “But in this day and age where the game has become homogenized, we’re looking for any contrast. It’s not as extreme as it used to be, but that’s why Hsieh Su-wei is fun to watch, because you feel like you can see the wheels turning in her mind as to where to place the ball, the geometry of the court. So many players use left and right, and she uses north and south as well.”","Hsieh is constantly changing depth: shifting her target from the backcourt to the forecourt as she mixes in drop shots, angled volleys and sliced and flat groundstrokes.","“Her hands can redirect a shot in either direction on both wings with pinpoint accuracy,” McNamee said. “That’s not normal.”","But outlier fast-twitch defensive skills are required to thrive in an era of abundant power and athleticism, of taller, stronger opposition with superior leverage like Petra Kvitova, Garbine Muguruza, Karolina Pliskova, Madison Keys and the ascendant Aryna Sabalenka.","“I try to do something else than the normal,” said Sevastova, a U.S. Open semifinalist last year whose trademark is the drop shot. “I think it’s important, and it’s my style. It’s not like I don’t have power. I just don’t have that much. But I can handle their pace and hit the ball quickly, and I like variety.”",Dehaes sees more women being able to survive the onslaught.,"“I think that has always been the case, but in the last few years we saw it a bit less,” he said. “I think the equipment played a big role, and there was the evolution of women’s tennis with players becoming stronger physically and better technically. Because everyone trains a lot and everyone trains well, which was not always the case in former times. So with more athletic players and more high-performance equipment, the pace of the game accelerated. But I think now the girls are getting used to it and are more able to counter the games of these super-powerful players.”","Tennis’s recent honor roll confirms that. Three of the four Grand Slam singles titles last year went to counterpunchers: the No. 1 player, Simona Halep, and Kerber and Wozniacki, all of whom have long had speed and defensive skills, but who also have focused on improving their serves and learning to embrace risk selectively.","“Honestly, it could be just 15 percent more aggression that can make the difference,” Austin said. “You are just robbing your opponent of a little bit of time on certain shots.”","Martin Blackman, general manager of player development at the United States Tennis Association, says he believes that “we will see more and more complete players on the women’s side.”","Purer power players are also trying to broaden their range. In her late teens, Osaka clearly had potent groundstrokes and a penetrating serve. But she did not make the leap to Grand Slam champion until she lost weight in 2018 and improved her explosive movement, agility and defensive skills with help from her new coach, Sascha Bajin, and her fitness coach, Abdul Sillah.","“She’s pulled back some; Sascha’s got her thinking more on the court rather than just see ball, hit ball,” Austin said. “Now, she’s fit enough and aware enough and realizes, ‘O.K., this is a red-light ball. I have to get the point back to neutral.’ Or ‘this is a green-light ball, and I can go big.’”",The artists are also at work on finding the time to use their brushes.,"“My challenge with Dasha,” said Dehaes, using Kasatkina’s nickname, “is to help her find a way to stay in the rally even under great pressure, and at a certain moment, the right moment, make the difference with a variation. But it’s not easy to vary when you play someone like Sabalenka, who hits every ball very hard from everywhere without much theory. It’s very hard to counter this kind of woman.”",Perhaps impossible when a true power player is on target.,"“If you have Serena and she’s at the top of her game, I still say that power is always going to win,” Austin said. “I don’t know if Sabalenka is 10 to 15 percent away from that top level or maybe just two weeks away, but when she’s all cylinders firing, I still think she’s going to take out the Kasatkinas, the Sevastovas, the Bartys. But let me tell you. If you’re off a little bit and your timing is messed up a little bit by those combinations — topspin, slice, short, deep — it’s a whole new ballgame.”"
Another Source of Conflict in Tennis: Are You Up or Down on Doubles? - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — After bowing out of the Australian Open this week, Jack Sock and his childhood friend and doubles partner, Jackson Withrow, ended up on opposite sides of a great divide.",Withrow’s childhood dream was to play professional tennis; doubles proved to be his only portal.,"Sock, the world’s second-ranked doubles player, has an Olympic gold medal from 2016 that he won in the mixed event, which led to his being honored at a University of Nebraska football game and throwing a ceremonial first pitch at a Kansas City Royals baseball game.","In addition, he shares four Grand Slam titles, three in doubles and the other in mixed.","Sock, 26, has also climbed as high as No. 8 in singles, which is where he stood last year at this time. His ranking since has tumbled to 105, but singles remains No. 1 in his heart.","“I can personally say if I’m not relevant in the singles world and my only choice is to play doubles, I’d probably stop playing tennis,” Sock said.","Doubles is supposed to be the harmonic expression of tennis, but at the Australian Open, the doubles court has become the receptacle for petty grievances and philosophical divergences. It started with Bernard Tomic accusing his countryman and Davis Cup captain, Lleyton Hewitt, of a litany of leadership failures, including writing himself into the lineup for Davis Cup.","Then Dan Evans, the 189th-ranked singles player, fanned the flames in his native Britain by describing doubles players as athletes “who didn’t make it at singles and people who didn’t have the attitude to work hard enough to make it in the singles game.”","Jamie Murray, ranked seventh in doubles, dismissed Evans’s comments as “lazy” and “just total nonsense” and said, “We should be celebrating any success we have in the sport — doubles, mixed doubles, wheelchairs, whatever.”","The Australian Open is called the Happy Slam, but the crankiness quotient at this one has been high — as if everybody woke up on the wrong side of 2019. The men’s tour appears to be a house divided over the future of the ATP president and chief executive, Chris Kermode, who some believe should be removed from office. The women have complained that the men do not support gender equity. The men fell in line behind an exasperated Rafael Nadal, who said at a news conference, “I don’t know why you are trying all the time to create these kinds of stories on this thing.”","On Wednesday, the tournament’s 10th day, there was harmony, at least in the stands of Rod Laver Arena. During a changeover in the Australian Samantha Stosur’s semifinal victory with Zhang Shuai against Barbora Strycova and Marketa Vondrousova, the Village People blared from the speakers and even the chair umpire got in the act of forming the letters in Y.M.C.A.","By the tournament’s stretch run, all of Australia was celebrating doubles since the men’s, women’s, mixed and wheelchair finals included at least one native son or daughter. (An Australian hasn’t won a singles title here since 1978.) But no amount of success will sway Sock to embrace doubles exclusively.","Sock, who played most of last year with Mike Bryan because Bryan’s twin, Bob, was nursing a hip injury, won two majors and about $1.3 million playing doubles and $738,747 while compiling a 9-21 record in singles. He finished 17th over all in ATP prize money despite ranking outside the top 100 in singles.","“It’s not just singles that you can make a career from in tennis,” said Murray, who has six Grand Slam titles to his brother Andy’s three in singles. “It’s important for a lot of young kids to know that growing up. It’s not easy to make it in the tennis world. There are only a few people that can make a really good living from the game. The journey is incredibly long. However you get there, whether it’s singles or doubles or whatever, there’s options there for you.”","With four career singles titles, including three in 2017, Sock would appear to have more options than most. But he doesn’t see it that way.","Ryan Harrison, who teamed with Sam Querrey to beat Sock and Withrow in the round of 16 this week, said: “Jack doesn’t want to feel discredited for his singles ability because of his dominance in doubles. And a lot of time his success in doubles overshadows him as a top-10 singles player. He’s going, ‘I’ve been 8 in the world in singles, and people are talking about me like a doubles guy.’ That perception is always going to be difficult for him.”","As long as the stigma persists that doubles players are lesser than singles players, the Socks of the sport are going to have a strong incentive to stick to singles. Harrison said he has tried to appeal to Sock’s vanity.","“I’ve told him it’d give him more confidence in singles if he took more pride in literally being the most dominant doubles player,” Harrison said. “He feels like he’s being viewed as someone not capable of playing singles.”",Mike Bryan said he hated to hear Sock would sooner leave the sport than stick to doubles.,"“When he gets out on the doubles court, he has a blast,” Bryan said. “And because of doubles, he’s played in some of the biggest stadiums in the world, he’s won a gold medal, he’s been honored at a Nebraska football game. What’s the harm in all of that?”"
Stevie Johnson Still Carries His Grief Onto the Tennis Court - The New York Times,"DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Before the start of every tennis match now, Stevie Johnson walks to the back of the court and squats down for a moment or two. Sometimes he says a little prayer. Often he gives himself an abbreviated pep talk.",Almost always he thinks of doing things the way his father wanted him to.,"“I really just say a couple of words to myself to help me put everything in perspective,” said Johnson, 29, whose father, Steve, died of a heart attack at 58 nearly two years ago. “I tell myself to do things the right way and to treat people with respect. And I remind myself that tennis doesn’t define me.”","Johnson has had a hard time keeping tennis, and life, in perspective since May 2017, when his mother reached him by phone just as he was about to board a plane to Rome for the Italian Open and told him that his father had failed to wake up that morning.","Not only had his father taught Stevie how to play the game, he also sat in the stands for college matches at Southern California and for pro matches at Wimbledon and the United States Open. He witnessed his son’s first ATP pro titles in Nottingham, England, in 2016 and in Houston just weeks before his death.","Entering the Delray Beach Open, which began on Feb. 16, Johnson had not won a match since squandering a two-sets-to-one lead against ninth-seeded Dominic Thiem in the second round of last year’s U.S. Open.","Johnson had lost nine straight matches, including one against Borna Coric in the Americans’ Davis Cup semifinal loss to Croatia in September. He fell in the first round at last week’s New York Open to 154th-ranked Brayden Schnur, even though he served for the match and held two match points (Schnur was the eventual tournament runner-up). After that loss, Johnson was despondent in the locker room.","When Johnson, seeded fourth in Delray, won his first match on Tuesday over a longtime friend and Southern California neighbor, 131st-ranked Jason Jung, he said, “I’m just glad to get the monkey off my back and not lose 10 straight.”","He followed that with a win over Paolo Lorenzi of Italy on Thursday but then lost in the quarterfinals to 82nd-ranked Radu Albot of Moldova, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5). In that match, Johnson raced to a 5-0 lead in only 18 minutes, and then to a 6-1, 3-1 lead before Albot reeled off 12 of the next 15 points and five consecutive games. Johnson was two points from winning the match late in the third set, but Albot sneaked to the net for a backhand stab volley, and Johnson then hit a forehand wide on match point.","“It’s embarrassing,” he said. “It’s frustrating. I was up a set and a break, and I got tight. Thought I was on a good path, and then this. That’s the way life’s been going for me these days.”","Despite his five-month losing streak, Johnson’s ranking should stay near his current No. 34. He is the third-best American, behind No. 9 John Isner and No. 29 Frances Tiafoe, the defending Delray Beach champion, who lost in the first round here this year.","Losing has been a bitter pill, especially because he came so close to upsetting Thiem. But a rolled ankle midway through the second set contributed to the 3-hour-34-minute loss.","“I probably shouldn’t have even played after the U.S. Open,” Johnson said. “I just didn’t have any tennis left in me. Just all the traveling, from New York to L.A. to Croatia, back to L.A., then Asia and Europe. The way the schedule is, you feel like you need to play all the time, and I got into that trap. But that’s what you have to do when you play tennis; you have to earn it.","“I’m not an N.F.L. player who signs a lucrative four-year deal and then can take five months off, have a bad slump and then turn it around. Every week you have to prove yourself. If you have a bad six months, you can go from No. 8 in the world to No. 78, or worse.”","Johnson has been transparent about how difficult life has been since his father’s death. He often looks to his players’ box, only to see a glaring vacuum where his father used to sit. There are days when he still can’t bring himself to leave the house.","After a third-round loss to the eventual runner-up Marin Cilic at Wimbledon in 2017, he was so physically and emotionally spent that he developed a fever that lingered and landed him in the hospital. And after a three-set loss in the first round of the 2018 New York Open, he felt as if the ground was spinning, and he experienced shortness of breath that was attributed to anxiety.","That experience led Johnson to seek advice from Mardy Fish, a former top-10 player whose career was marked by bouts of anxiety. At the urging of his mother, Michelle, Johnson also sought help from a psychologist, someone he continues to see whenever he is home in Redondo Beach, Calif.","“Stevie’s mom has been instrumental to him,” said Johnson’s wife, Kendall, a former U.S.C. volleyball player who has been with him for almost seven years. “She’s paved the way with her own recovery and helps him put things into perspective. Even through his grieving, Stevie knows his father wouldn’t want him to struggle and that he would want him to keep playing.”","Craig Boynton, who has coached Johnson through much of his professional career, said he understood the danger of being sucked down a losing-run rabbit hole.","“The funny thing about streaks is that when they snowball the right way, you stop thinking and have great clarity in your execution of your shots,” Boynton said. “But when the streak is going the wrong way, there’s a tendency to overthink and doubt yourself. That takes away your focus from your execution. There’s no flow, and it creates drought or a rut, and that’s what Stevie’s been going through. One match can change things in either direction.”","After two wins in Delray Beach, there was finally a greater hop in Johnson’s step. But it does not mean he no longer has dark thoughts, no longer wonders whether he should even continue to play tennis.","“Some days it’s easy to fight through and enjoy it,” Johnson said. “But those hard days have been outweighing the good days at the moment.”","“It’s hard to fake the passion,” he added, choking on his words and using a towel to wipe away tears. “I mean, my father was such a big part of my tennis life. Tennis is just a weird dynamic for me right now. Every day is different. I mean, he should still be here watching me.”"

It has been 30 years since Thomas Muster, the intense Austrian, whacked groundstrokes in a custom-designed chair designed to protect his postoperative left knee, which was injured when a drunken driver plowed into Muster’s parked vehicle at the tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla.",Muster returned to the tour and reached No. 1.,"Bryan’s renaissance at an age when most tennis stars have long since retired is certainly one for the short list, too.","It has been less than a year since he was hobbling down the boardwalk in Santa Cruz, Calif., with his wife, Michelle, certain that his remarkable career was over. He was concerned, above all, about getting healthy enough to play with his three young children.","“I couldn’t walk for more than five minutes,” he said.","The orthopedic surgeon Edwin Su resurfaced Bryan’s hip on Aug. 2 at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and explained that, if all went very well, Bryan could envision returning to tournament play eight months later.","He returned to action in five months and, now at the eight-month mark, is winning significant tournaments.","“What Bob is doing is incredible,” Su said in a telephone interview on Monday. “He really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implant.”","“Incredible” is quite a word choice from a surgeon who has performed more than 4,000 such procedures. A few others were on professional athletes trying to save their careers, including the former major league pitcher Colby Lewis.","But no professional tennis player has had this procedure and returned to the fore, although Andy Murray, who underwent the same type of operation in January in London after plenty of chatting and texting with Bryan, may try to do the same.","“The things that make Bob Bryan great, you don’t know if you are going to lose that with an artificial joint and surgery,” Su said. “It’s amazing to see he doesn’t seem to have lost any of it and in fact is now able to play without pain.”","David Macpherson, the Bryans’ longtime coach, said Bob was playing like the “30-year-old Bob.”","“He’s exploding to poaches like the old days when he would just steal points from incredible cross-court returns by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking off balls,” Macpherson said in Miami. “I also feel he’s a little more confident on the return, letting it go and doing more damage than before, and he is still serving just as nasty. So I really feel he’s in a great place right now, where he’s just enjoying his life and loves his family but is getting a second lease on tennis.”","After Bob’s hip problem became acute in Madrid last May, Mike went on to win Wimbledon and the United States Open with Jack Sock. Bob attended their practices in New York while using a cane. But there was no doubt the twins would reunite on court if Bob could recover.","“With all the success Mike was having with Jack in the majors, Bob just handled it all with so much class and was so supportive of Mike in that time,” MacPherson said.","Doubles has been deeply overshadowed in the modern era, with the biggest stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal focusing on singles in Grand Slam tournaments. But in a parched environment, the Bryans — Mike the right-hander, and Bob the lefty — have managed to carve out a rich niche with their winning ways and personalities.","They have enthusiastically gone above and beyond to sign just about every autograph and pose for just about every selfie, but Bob is reaching a new audience now.","“I talk to probably three or four people a week, people who get my number and call me about hip problems,” he said. “A professional soccer player in Australia. I’m getting hit up by people all the time.”","He said he had spoken with Murray, the former world No. 1 from Britain, most recently about a week ago.","“He was asking me a lot of questions in the early weeks, because obviously those are the weeks where you are not feeling great and probably a little concerned,” Bryan said. “But I think he’s probably feeling really good right now.”","Murray has posted video of himself on social media lightly hitting tennis balls. But returning in singles, with full-court coverage required, is a more daunting prospect.","“I think a three-out-of-five-set singles match is almost close to 50 times more physical than doubles,” Bryan said. “It’s going to really challenge Andy, the movement. But I can jump. I can lunge, and I am not sore after matches.”","As Murray debated whether to have surgery, Bryan put him in touch with Su, who said Murray was an ideal candidate for the procedure. Murray ultimately chose to have it done closer to home by Sarah Muirhead-Allwood, a leading British hip surgeon..",Can he come back and play singles at the highest level?,"“I think he would be able to,” Su said.","Hip resurfacing is not a total hip replacement. It calls for shaving a thin layer of damaged bone off the ball of the hip joint and replacing it with a metal cap — “like crowning a tooth,” Su said.","A metal socket is also put in place. “When Bob refers to it as his metal hip, it is truly metal,” Su said.","Bryan credited Su, an avid tennis player, for his success so far.","“People tell me this surgery comes down to millimeters,” Bryan said. “I’ve talked to people who had different doctors and have done the same procedure, and they feel like crap.”","Su said he believed Bryan’s recovery had been accelerated in part by the use of a relatively new rehabilitation tool: an anti-gravity treadmill, which supports a player at the hips with an inflatable lower-body compartment and reduces the risks of fractures in the recovery phase.","“You can un-weight the body to 60 percent to 70 or 80,” Su said.","Su saw Bryan compete in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., last month.","“I love it, just to see what he’s able to do,” Su said. “I cringe a little bit when he dives, but he’s done it several times, and no worse for the wear.”",Will such acrobatics and the other rigors of professional tennis put Bryan at greater risk of requiring follow-up surgery down the road?,"“That’s a really good question we don’t have the answer to,” Su said. “We don’t have enough data in terms of how it would hold up to activity such as this. This has been done now for almost two decades, so there are some very active patients out there, and activity doesn’t seem to make it wear out. We’re drawing from the experiences of recreational athletes.”","The Miami title was the Bryans’ 118th together on tour. They had once planned on retiring after the 2012 Olympics and were close to retirement at the 2017 Australian Open. But such plans are on hold, even with their 41st birthday looming on April 29.","“Now we’re looking at Tokyo in 2020,” Bob said of the next Olympics, while emphasizing that “we never wanted to play until we were 45 or 46.”",Skepticism is definitely permitted at this stage.,"“I know,” Bob said with a chuckle. “My wife doesn’t believe me, either.”"
Second Slam Title Signals Naomi Osaka Has the Power to Rule Tennis - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — In a riveting Australian Open women’s final on Saturday, Petra Kvitova tried unsuccessfully to shake Naomi Osaka. Kvitova earned five break points in the first set, which she could not convert, and saved three championship points in the second, which she ultimately was unable to capitalize on.","Osaka refused to fade away. Later, as the Rod Laver Arena crowd celebrated Osaka’s 7-6 (2), 5-7, 6-4 victory, Kvitova looked around to congratulate her opponent — and couldn’t find her anywhere.","“Well done, Naomi,” Kvitova said, craning her neck to look behind her. “Where are you?”","Every little thing Osaka does on the court inexorably draws the eye to her, but take the racket out of her hand and she visibly shrinks from the spotlight. Born in Japan and raised in the United States by a Japanese mother and a Haitian father, she was asked in an interview on Australian television if she was ready to become the face of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.","“Yikes,” she said, wincing. “Hopefully for their sake they don’t do that.”",How can they not?,"Osaka came into this tournament last year ranked No. 72. When the new world rankings come out on Monday, Osaka, 21, the reigning United States Open champion, will become the first singles player, male or female, from Japan to reach No. 1. The retired Chinese star Li Na might as well have been passing a torch when she presented Osaka with the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup in the on-court trophy presentation.","Li, a two-time major winner, rose to No. 2, behind Serena Williams, shortly after winning the 2014 Australian Open. For five years, no singles player from Asia had climbed higher.","Osaka, the first woman since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to win her first two major titles back to back, does not appear to be going anywhere but forward.","When Osaka defeated Williams in the U.S. Open final in September, she was the eighth different woman since the 2017 Australian Open to win a Grand Slam title. By consolidating her victory in New York with her performance in Melbourne, Osaka demonstrated that she has staying power.","Osaka’s victory over Williams, in retrospect, seems to have represented a coronation of sorts, one queen ceding the throne to her successor. That idea got lost in that final’s chaotic finish, when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, warned Williams about a coaching infraction, setting off a chain of events that thrust Williams into the spotlight and Osaka into the shadows.","“Definitely she is a great one,” Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, said of Osaka. “We’ll see what the future will bring. But for sure she has probably everything that has to be there to play her best tennis.”","Kvitova, 28, was the same age that Osaka is now in 2011 when she won her first Wimbledon title. It took her three years to return to a Grand Slam final, and she took the title again at Wimbledon in 2014.","“I probably wasn’t really ready to win it, to be honest,” said Kvitova, who spoke of struggling to adjust to increased expectations — and not just from the public.","“You’re thinking like you have to win every single match because you just won a Grand Slam,” she said, adding, “I put a bit more pressure than I should.”","Osaka also expects a lot of herself. It is what drove her in the past year to create more spin on her forehand, which produced eight winners in the deciding set on Saturday. She has also worked on the placement, and not just the pace, of her serve, also to great effect; she recorded nine aces in the final to finish the tournament with 59, which was 22 more than the next-highest woman.","And against Kvitova, Osaka was able to corral her emotions after the second set got away from her, which hasn’t always been her strong suit. She lost in the semifinals of a tuneup event in Brisbane after she worked herself into a fury because she felt it was a match that no major champion should lose.","Rain was in the air in Melbourne Park — a few drops fell late in the third set, prompting the roof to be closed for the end of the match. But Osaka can create her own weather system, and the storm clouds were gathering between her ears in the second set as Kvitova became more aggressive with her groundstrokes and pushed Osaka deeper behind the baseline.","As the second set wore on, Osaka rubbed her temples, glowered at her racket and, at one point, turned her back on Kvitova and took deep breaths, trying to gather herself. After losing the last four games, Osaka took a bathroom break to regroup before the deciding set, and left the court in tears.","While she was gone, Osaka said, she reminded herself that Kvitova was an excellent player. She told herself she had to expect a hard-fought battle, especially after the long and winding path Kvitova had traveled to get to the final, her first since she sustained a career-threatening injury while fighting off a knife-wielding burglar in her Czech Republic apartment in late 2016.","“I can’t really act entitled,” Osaka said. “To be playing against one of the best players in the world, to lose a set, suddenly think that I’m so much better than her, that isn’t a possibility.”","Osaka’s pep talk to herself was effective. In the third game of the third set, she broke Kvitova. “I literally just tried to turn off my feelings,” Osaka said.","She has won 60 consecutive matches in which she has taken the first set, but don’t ask her to explain how she does it. Talking is not one of her talents, Osaka said. “Like in my day-to-day I might speak like 10 sentences,” she said.","Osaka grimaced through the trophy presentation, which she was able to laugh about afterward. “I forgot to smile,” she said. “I was told to smile and I didn’t. I was panicking.”",Osaka forgot a lot of the reminders she had written down on a sheet of paper — just in case she won and had to deliver a speech. Osaka is shy but thoughtful; reserved but disarmingly revealing.,"Describing the third set, she said, “I just felt kind of hollow, like I was a robot, sort of. I was just executing my orders, like I just did what I’ve been practicing my whole life.”"

"A Male Tennis Pro, a Female Coach and Shrugs for Anyone Who Thinks It Won’t Work - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Lucas Pouille, the brightest young star in men’s tennis in France, was flickering.","Pouille, 24, reached a career-high ranking of No. 10 in March, but did not win more than two matches consecutively after that, finishing the year with a 14-17 run. Playing without inspiration or belief, he slipped to No. 32 by the end of the season.","“I lost confidence, and then I was not enjoying so much being on court, being on tour,” he said. “I didn’t really want to play tennis.”","He had to find a solution, he said. “I had to find my joy of being on court.”","Pouille split with Emmanuel Planque, his coach of six years, in November. Pouille, who had yearned to take a break from the tour but decided to finish the season so he could play in the Davis Cup final, was on his own for eight days. When he did pick up a racket, it was only to play minitennis with friends.","But on the Monday after the Davis Cup final, which France lost to Croatia, he met with his team’s captain-in-waiting, Amélie Mauresmo.",Pouille had another offer: Coach him instead.,"“When we were talking to each other, it was this couple hours of talking that really had me thinking,” Mauresmo said. “He had me thinking that he’s ambitious, that he wants to do everything in order to be as good as possible. He kind of convinced me with what he was saying, that he was ready to do all the efforts and the hard work that are going with being at the top, with digging deep to be at your best.”","Stepping away from the Davis Cup position before she even started was not an easy decision for Mauresmo, especially considering the excitement over her appointment as the country’s first female captain. But it was made easier, she said, by the radical changes coming to the competition this season, which will reduce the final rounds to a World Cup-style format played at one site, with three matches of best-of-three sets in each pairing, instead of five matches in a best-of-five format.","“I think the captain’s role will be really reduced,” Mauresmo, 39, said. “What was interesting for me was all the weeks of preparations, the three days of competition, the best-of-five, building a team throughout a year, and the home-and-away. For me, I grew up watching that. I grew up having the emotions that go with it.”","“So I have no doubt that it will be a good show, a good competition for the crowd, and they will probably put on a big show or whatever. But as a captain, I didn’t feel that the role was that important.”",Pouille said he was encouraged by the belief Mauresmo showed in him when she left such a high-profile opportunity behind.,"“That’s what I wanted to have with me: someone who believes in me, and who believes we can go very far together,” Pouille said. “I’m very happy that she’s part of it now, and we can work together, we can have the best results possible.”","Pouille is the only man in the ATP Tour’s top 100 currently coached by a woman outside his immediate family, but he said Mauresmo’s gender was not a consideration in his decision to hire her.","“For me, it doesn’t matter if it’s a man, woman, grandfather, grandmother — I don’t care,” he said. “As long as they know what they’re talking about. In women’s sports or men’s sports, in the end you’re dealing with the same stuff on the court.","“Mentally, it’s the same stuff. Technically, she knows tennis. She knows what I need to do on the court to be better. For me, that’s what is important.”","Pouille’s choice of Mauresmo was the second high-profile hiring of a female coach in men’s tennis this decade. The first was in 2014, when Andy Murray also hired Mauresmo.","Pouille’s decision generated far less second-guessing than Murray’s, which was met with skepticism from both the news media and fellow players.","“The pressure with Andy was tremendous, and the criticism that went with it was huge,” Mauresmo said. “I knew I had a lot to prove, and I knew that every match he would play would be about the job I’d done, or not done, or could do better. That was making it pretty difficult, but pretty challenging as well, and I worked really, really hard.”",Pouille said many of the queries that came with his choice were more inane than negative.,"“A lot of people have asked me: ‘Is it different that she’s a woman? What do you do — can she come in the locker room?’” he said. “But what is important is what’s happening on court, what’s happening to get ready for the match, and what happens after the match. I don’t care who is in the locker room.”","Pouille said that, for now, he appreciated the lack of wasted time in his practice sessions with Mauresmo, and also her drive and willingness to join him in his various fitness and running drills.","“You can see on the court that she’s a champion,” he said. “The way she is on the court, the way she’s committed to it, it’s just remarkable.”","Pouille is hoping that Mauresmo’s coaching can help him return to the top 10. Over the past three decades, French men’s tennis has packed the sport’s peloton, but it has struggled to catapult anyone into regular championship contention.","Pouille is one of five active Frenchmen who can claim to have made the top 10, joining Richard Gasquet, Gilles Simon, Gaël Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Together, they have reached only one Grand Slam final in the past decade: when Tsonga finished as the runner-up at the 2008 Australian Open.","Mauresmo says she probably has particular credibility in French tennis as a two-time Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1 player, accomplishments that outshine those of all the country’s other players — male or female — in her lifetime. But she is uncertain whether most men would be ready to hire a woman with less than hall-of-fame credentials.","“Probably not yet,” she said. “Maybe not, but it will come. Maybe not in the next two, three, five years, but it will come.”","Patience also was required as Pouille started his 2019 season. He opened the year by losing all three matches he played at the Hopman Cup, as well as another at the ATP tournament in Sydney. But on Tuesday at the Australian Open, he won his opening match convincingly, 6-1, 7-5, 6-4, over Mikhail Kukushkin.","Though he was relieved by the win, Pouille said his confidence in his choice of coach had never wavered.","“I know it’s going to take time, coming from a year where it has been quite difficult for me,” he said. “But I decided to work with Amélie because I trust her.”"
"Rafael Nadal, Playing a ‘Different Dimension of Tennis,’ Returns to Australian Open Final - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — There was nothing Stefanos Tsitsipas could do.","He tried pressing forward, only to see Rafael Nadal’s whizzing replies fly beyond his reach.","He tried staying patient, only to find himself being run across the baseline like a jack rabbit with a one-handed backhand.","He tried simply to hang on, hoping against hope that his legendary opponent would grant an opening, a reprieve, a string of games, maybe a set. Nadal did no such thing.","On Thursday night, Nadal once again provided every hard-hitting answer in a match at this tournament against an upstart opponent. This time he pummeled Tsitsipas, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0, moving with brutal efficiency into his fifth Australian Open final.","“I am playing well today,” he said when it was over, assessing the match with a bland understatement.","His inexperienced opponent offered a fuller, more exacting description. “It felt,” Tsitsipas said, “like a different dimension of tennis.”",[The women’s final is set: Petra Kvitova will face Naomi Osaka.],"On Sunday — having not lost a single set all tournament and looking in as fine a form on hardcourts as he has in his career — Nadal will play for a second title at Melbourne Park, 10 years after his first.","He will face the winner of Friday’s semifinal between top-seeded Novak Djokovic, Nadal’s longtime rival, and Lucas Pouille, a 24-year-old Frenchman who has made his own surprisingly deep run in Melbourne. Before this tournament, Pouille had never won a match here in five tries.",Nadal versus Tsitsipas was yet another match at this tournament touted as a battle of generations — all-time great versus budding YouTube sensation.,"Nadal, 32, has won 17 major championships and was playing his 30th Grand Slam semifinal.","Tsitsipas, 20, has just a single tour title. Though he enthralled crowds and flashed his talent throughout the tournament — including an upset of the two-time defending champion Roger Federer — he is still relatively new to pro tennis. He had never previously advanced past the fourth round of a major.","Despite the chasm in experience, it seemed Tsitsipas was playing well enough to have a chance.","Instead, it was never close. Nadal came out sharply, targeting lethal, down-the-line groundstrokes to seize momentum with a break in the third game. From that moment, his power suffocated the young Greek.","As much as Tsitsipas tried to inflict damage with flat returns, Nadal rarely seemed rushed. He was never broken. The first set was over in 31 pragmatic minutes. The second took 44. The third, another 31. By the standards of professional men’s tennis, those sets were sprints.","Not long after the match was done, Tsitsipas, who was seeded 14th, looked dazed at his news conference, lacking any of the optimistic energy he’d exuded after previous matches. On Tuesday, he had explained how he’d learned from losing to Nadal last summer in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. He had remembered coming off the court there feeling he would do much better next time against the Spaniard, because now he had a sense of Nadal’s game, “especially on hardcourt.”","Two days later, there was no such gumption.","“He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players,” Tsitsipas said, dolefully.",It looked as if he had just been pummeled in a boxing ring.,"“He has this, I don’t know, talent that no other player has,” Tsitsipas added. “His game style has something that it kind of makes the other half of your brain work more than it usually does. I’m trying to understand, but I cannot find an explanation.”","When Nadal took to the dais a few minutes later, there was nothing but clipped certainty. His answers, coming in his familiar accented English, were all business, same as his game has been for the past two weeks. He said all the right things about focus and routine and not getting too far ahead of matters. There is a final soon to play. This is no time for idle chatter or expansive thoughts. He was bland in the way that Tom Brady is bland.","“I have to keep doing the things that I am doing,” he said. “That’s my feeling, just keep playing the way that I am playing and let’s see.”","Bland, but effective. Ruthlessly so.","Nadal enters Sunday’s match having contested some of the most memorable finals in this tournament’s history, though he has won only one of the four. His only title here came in 2009, when he defeated Federer in five scintillating sets. In 2012, he succumbed to Djokovic after a 5-hour-53-minute marathon, the longest major tournament final on the books. In 2017, he and Federer staged the most recent of their epic major tournament duels, with Federer winning in five sets.","Nadal also reached the 2014 final, but he struggled with a debilitating back injury and lost to Stan Wawrinka.","Seeded second this year, Nadal began the tournament shadowed by questions about how long his body could withstand the rigors of a hardcourt Grand Slam event. He had not played a tour match since the United States Open in September, when he retired from his semifinal against Juan Martín del Potro, citing a leg injury. In November, he had ankle surgery. Then, in the run-up to the Australian Open, he withdrew from a tournament he had been scheduled to play in Brisbane, citing a thigh strain.","Asked if he expected to be back in this form, playing this well, gunning in his tour return for another Grand Slam title, his reply came quick. “Is not easy to be back after four months, and play the way I am playing,” he said. “Of course, I didn’t expect that at all.”"
"A Champion for Britain, and for Women’s Tennis - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — When Andy Murray announced that he planned to retire from tennis this year because of chronic hip pain, the news generated the expected plaudits and empathy from the rivals who had shared a locker room with him for years.","The most distinct voices in the chorus of praise, however, were female. In interviews and news conferences and on social media over the years, Murray established himself as a champion for equality and for women’s tennis. In doing so, he became an ally to the WTA tour, whose players have long felt unappreciated and undervalued by many in the men’s side of the sport.","“I’m really bummed for him, individually, but I’m also bummed for women’s tennis, because we just lost a huge spokesperson,” said Nicole Gibbs, a 25-year-old American pro. “Not that he’ll be silent in his retirement — I think he’ll remain really outspoken, and we’ll appreciate that. But it’s nice to see friendly male tennis player faces throughout the year, so that will be sorely missed for us.”","Murray has said he would like to play until Wimbledon this summer, but after a first-round loss Monday to Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut and now weighing another hip operation, he left open the possibility that he may have played the last match of his career.","In more than a decade as a top-10 player, Murray has used his prominent position to be an advocate for women in tennis in ways large and small. After being taught the game by his mother, Judy, Murray became the most high-profile men’s player to hire a female coach when he added Amélie Mauresmo to his team in 2014. He also has made a point of correcting reporters when they omit women from statistics, like at Wimbledon in 2017 when he interrupted a reporter who prefaced a question by saying that Sam Querrey was the first American player to reach the semifinals there since 2009.","“Male player,” Murray interrupted.","Serena Williams, one of the women the reporter had overlooked, praised Murray during a television appearance.","“I don’t think there’s a woman player — and there really shouldn’t be a female athlete — that is not totally supportive of Andy Murray,” Williams said. “He has spoken up for women’s issues and women’s rights, especially in tennis, forever — and he does it again. That’s one thing that we love about him.”","Murray has not always been comfortable with the praise he receives for what he considers simple gestures, or with the label of “outspoken.”","“I haven’t gone out of my way to talk about it,” Murray said in August. “If someone has asked me a question, I’ve given my answer. When a male athlete speaks positively about female athletes, it makes a headline — which is strange, and shouldn’t really be the case, but it is.”","But more than his public pronouncements, Murray has won over female players by acknowledging and validating them in a way few other male players have. The Swiss player Timea Bacsinszky said that Murray was a rare men’s pro who would greet her and her team around tournaments and show his appreciation for her efforts.","“I don’t remember where it was, but he comes to me and he’s like, ‘Oh, great job three weeks ago, you killed it, you were playing so great in the quarterfinals,’” Bacsinszky said of Murray. “I was like, Wow, the guy is looking at the women’s results as well! He just appreciates good tennis.”","Murray prepared last month for a tournament in Brisbane by hitting with Naomi Osaka, the reigning United States Open champion. Osaka said she rued the news that her new practice partner could be leaving the sport soon.","“I felt really sad because I’ve never really talked to him before Brisbane, right?” she said. “Then we started talking. He was so nice. Like, he’s a super nice person. Now I just feel like I lost — he’s not a friend — but I lost someone that could be a friend.”",His appeal crosses generations. Billie Jean King called Murray a “champion on and off the court.”,"“Your greatest impact on the world may be yet to come,” King wrote on Twitter. “Your voice for equality will inspire future generations.”","King, who helped the women’s tour get off the ground in the early 1970s, knows how valuable that kind of support has been, and how rare it still is at times.","In 2016, Novak Djokovic, the current president of the ATP player council, was criticized by Murray and others after he said that, after years of gains by women seeking equal pay at major tournaments, men should continue to agitate for a larger share of the pot at combined events. (Djokovic later backtracked, saying his comments were “not the best articulation of my view.”)","And when Italy’s Stefano Travaglia stepped down from his seat on the 10-player council at the end of last season, the council appointed Ukraine’s Sergiy Stakhovsky, a well-known lightning rod, to fill it. Stakhovsky has been dismissive of women’s tennis and its players in recent years, ridiculing the concept of equal pay and making homophobic remarks about the women’s tour.","Stakhovsky’s comments have repeatedly drawn Murray’s rebuke, both publicly and privately. But they also have left women’s pros feeling little support from men’s players when debates around equal prize money have flared up, as they do periodically.","“Not a lot of warmth coming from that side or that perspective,” Maria Sharapova said.","Andrea Petkovic said allies were crucial to the women’s game as it seeks to maintain the level of equality it has achieved, and as it seeks to close remaining gaps. And that is why she said she would miss Murray as well.","“He was always my favorite, and I think it will be a huge loss for tennis in general, but also for the WTA,” she said. “Because even nowadays, when you think everything is equal, you still need men, especially successful men, to speak up for women.”","Murray’s reputation as a supporter of women gained notice far beyond the corridors of tennis. Before the 2017 United States Open, he was profiled in Elle Magazine. And last year, when the comedian Sarah Silverman was describing her ideal man in an interview on Ellen DeGeneres’s television show, she said, “I like a masculine man, but he has to be a feminist — that contrast is very hot to me.”","“Like Andy Murray,” DeGeneres suggested.","“Oh my God, like Andy Murray!” Silverman exclaimed. “Yes!”"
"At Australian Open, a Legacy Tracing Back to a Backyard in Mexico - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Emilio Nava stood at the microphone on the court of Rod Laver Arena and smiled broadly.","“Wow,” he said, smiling again. “Wow.”","It was hard to know he had just lost. Nava, 17, seeded 13th, saved three championship points and held one of his own before falling, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (12), to top-seeded Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the Australian Open boys’ singles final on Saturday. (On Friday, Nava lost in the boys’ doubles final.)","Despite the double dose of disappointment, he remained undimmed.","“It means the world to come out here on Rod Laver and play, thank you so much,” he said. “Hopefully I’ll be back, and see you later, thank you!”","The foundation of tennis success in Nava’s family can be traced to an undersized court in a small town in Mexico. His grandfather Ernesto Escobedo Sr. fell in love with the sport when he watched a Davis Cup tie in Los Angeles. After moving his large family to Jerez, Mexico, he built a tennis court, or as much of one as he could fit, in the family’s backyard.","Xóchitl Nava, Emilio’s mother, said the little court her father built had its limitations, but also offered boundless opportunities.","“On one side of the court, we didn’t have room to hit a backhand or forehand,” she said in a telephone interview. “So it was a tennis court, but more of a playground where we could hit balls and have fun.”",Their father’s passion for tennis rubbed off on many of his 10 children.,"“When we started getting older, everybody went their own ways,” Xóchitl Nava said. “But we were always playing tennis.”","That court spurred her to a modest professional career — she reached a high of 284th and represented Mexico in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. But it proved an even stronger trampoline for the next generation: Nava’s reaching two junior Grand Slam finals at this tournament alone is just the latest example."," Xóchitl Nava’s nephew Ernesto Escobedo reached a career-best ATP ranking of No. 68 in 2017. Her oldest son, Eduardo, plays at Wake Forest, the reigning national champion. Her middle son, Diego, plays for Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles.",Emilio Nava first made a splash at the elite junior level by reaching the final of the prestigious Eddie Herr tournament last year. He stays in touch with his tennis-playing cousins and siblings in an active group chat.,"“It’s everything, really,” he said of the sport. “Especially when you train every day, it becomes a lifestyle, you know? It becomes every day that you’re thinking about it — you try to relax a little bit, but it’s still there. But it’s fun, yeah, yeah, for sure.”","He now splits his time between California and Alicante, Spain, where he trains at the Juan Carlos Ferrero Equelite Sport Academy. When he is home in Woodland Hills, Calif., he trains across the street at the backyard court of his cousin Jaime’s house.","On Sunday, Xóchitl Nava expressed little disappointment about Emilio’s defeat.","“Seeing him in the finals, for us, it’s like a dream,” she said. “We’re just very lucky and fortunate to have Emilio, and to watch him play in a big stadium like that, it’s really unbelievable.”"
"As Men’s Team Tennis Events Rise, the Coed Hopman Cup Is Left in Limbo - The New York Times","PERTH, Australia — When Serena Williams and Roger Federer played against each other for the first time, on Tuesday night at the Hopman Cup, it was the ultimate expression of an event that has brought the best men and best women in tennis together for more than three decades.","But despite the power of seeing Williams and Federer on opposite sides of the net, the future of the Hopman Cup is uncertain, with a new men’s team event set to eclipse it, part of a trend of realignment and reinvention in tennis. Tennis Australia, which manages the Hopman Cup, will next year help organize the ATP Cup, a 10-day tournament that will have men’s teams from 24 countries competing across three Australian cities for ranking points and $15 million in prize money.","With mixed doubles increasingly outstripped in prize money and prestige at Grand Slam events, the Hopman Cup — with two-person teams from eight countries competing in singles and mixed doubles — is the lone place to see top men and top women team up besides the Olympics.","Though Federer did not participate in the Hopman Cup through the middle years of his career, he has a long attachment to the event, first coming to Perth as a hitting partner in 1999. He won the tournament with Martina Hingis in 2001 about a month before taking his first title on the ATP Tour. At the next Hopman Cup, he partnered with his future wife, Mirka Vavrinec.",[Read: Roger Federer struggles with Serena Williams’s serve. And vice versa.],"“Men and women, we share a lot of tournaments together, but it’s not the same as when you play each other or share the same court,” Federer said. “So I think the players have always enjoyed this event.”","The Hopman Cup’s distinction as a mixed event stands in contrast to the trend of new team tennis concepts for men only. Tennis Australia has taken an aggressive role in event creation, cofounding the men-only Laver Cup and the ATP Cup in recent years.","That focus on men’s tennis could doom the coed Hopman Cup. The host cities for the ATP Cup have not yet been announced, but the state-of-the-art Perth Arena, where the Hopman Cup has been held since 2013, is a likely choice. Even if Perth is not chosen, it would be difficult to imagine Tennis Australia hosting two competing team events in the same week.","The Hopman Cup remains an oddity in its 31st year, at once a playful exhibition that serves as a relaxing lead-up to the Australian Open and, since 1997, an officially sanctioned International Tennis Federation event.","The tournament has been bankrolled by the Western Australian government’s tourism body, Tourism W.A. Player appearance contracts have included clauses forbidding them from criticizing Perth, and at times the programming can feel like an infomercial for the region. After his first match at this year’s tournament, Federer gave an on-court interview that centered on his appreciation for the region and a photo shoot at a scenic rock formation nearby.","Among locals, the main concern is less about preserving the Hopman Cup and more about making sure that isolated Perth, which is 1,300 miles from another city of more than 100,000 people, keeps a foothold in tennis and is not left out of the pre-Australian Open swing.","In the wider tennis community, the Hopman Cup’s uniqueness is appreciated. It has rarely sparked the tribal passions on which Davis Cup prides itself, but the Hopman Cup has been a crowd-pleasing event, cherished by tennis fans who have savored the opportunity to see the sport’s top women and top men compete and commingle.","The New Year’s Day battle of Williams and Frances Tiafoe against Federer and Belinda Bencic represented an apex of many captivating Hopman Cup combinations. Marat Safin and Dinara Safina, the only brother-sister pair to both reach the No. 1 ranking, played together for Russia in 2009. Boris Becker and Steffi Graf played together in 1992 for the only time in their careers, a pairing of stars so sought after that a German television station helped the tournament organizers pay the players’ appearance fees.","The tournament has also featured some irresistible matchups of men’s and women’s stars who would never otherwise intersect. In the 2011 final, the 5-foot-5 Justine Henin tried to return the booming serve of the 6-foot-10 John Isner.","Not everyone is ready to write an obituary for the event, though. David Haggerty, president of the I.T.F., which sanctions the Hopman Cup as its official mixed team competition, said the event was “very, very important and should continue.”","Haggerty said he expected Tennis Australia to honor its remaining contractual obligations for managing the Hopman Cup in the first week of the season, which run through 2022.","“We’re just excited to continue to see Hopman Cup through because it is a great way to have the men and women playing,” said Haggerty, who spearheaded a massive overhaul of the Davis Cup format last year despite strong resistance from governing bodies, including Tennis Australia.","If Saturday’s final was the event’s last gasp, it had a breathtaking finish, with Federer and Bencic prevailing in an 18-shot rally on a winner-take-all final point against Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, clinching a second straight title for the Swiss pair.","Tennis Australia’s Paul Kilderry, who serves as the Hopman Cup’s tournament director, declined to comment for this article, citing uncertainty about the tournament’s future.","As Haggerty expressed reason for the Hopman Cup to endure, Ross Hutchins, the ATP vice president for player relations, was scouting Perth Arena as a potential venue for the ATP Cup, for which he will be managing director. Hutchins is also visiting Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney, which all have existing tennis facilities.","“Ultimately we thought this time of year, leading into a Grand Slam, is important to do something major in, and that’s what we will target,” Hutchins said. “This event will be a major event on the ATP Tour.”","The ATP Cup is landing in a jam-packed first week of the tennis season, which this year has seven tournaments: the Hopman Cup; WTA tournaments in Auckland, New Zealand, and Shenzhen, China; ATP tournaments in Doha, Qatar, and Pune, India; and a combined ATP-WTA tournament in Brisbane. Hutchins said only one of the ATP events would remain on the schedule as a complement to the ATP Cup, with no survivor yet designated.","The ATP is eager to add more events that it will own outright. The ATP Cup will be the third new annual men’s team event introduced since 2017. The Federer-backed Laver Cup, which pits a European team against one from the rest of the world, is held in September. The reworked 18-country Davis Cup will culminate in November. Hutchins said he thought there was room for all three to flourish.","“I don’t think there is a fatigue of team events because it’s not something that we think is diluted, and they’re all slightly different,” he said.","But there is nothing quite like the Hopman Cup on the horizon. Without any fixed plans for the event’s end or its continuation, players and organizers at this year’s tournament participated with a mixture of wistfulness and confusion.","In the afterglow of her match with Federer, Williams was caught off-guard by a question about the Hopman Cup’s probable demise. “Oh, really? I never heard that,” Williams said. “It would be heartbreaking.”"
"For Australian Men, Off-Court Drama Overshadows the Tennis - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — As the tennis world was transfixed on Andy Murray  as he played what may have been the final match of his career last Monday night, another drama was beginning in Interview Room 2 at the Australian Open.","After a first-round loss, Australia’s Bernard Tomic launched the opening volley in an off-court rift between Lleyton Hewitt and some of the top male players in Australian tennis, a conflict that kept heads turning and eyes rolling throughout the tournament’s first week.","“I’m going to say it honestly: No one likes him anymore,” Tomic said of Hewitt, the country’s most successful men’s player in the past 20 years and the current Davis Cup captain.","Australian men’s tennis was a dominant force in the sport in the 1950s and 1960s, producing players who won 52 of the 80 Grand Slam singles titles in that span. Hewitt arrived on the scene many years later and in the early 2000s, finished two seasons at No. 1 and captured two Grand Slam titles.","But ever since Hewitt fell out of the top tier in 2006, Australia has not had a male Grand Slam singles champion or a top-10 men’s player. Instead, men’s tennis in the country has now become a soap opera, more memorable for its spats than its results on the court.","At this Open, every Australian man fell out of the tournament after just six days. It meant that the host country had failed to have a representative in the second week of men’s singles for the eighth time in the past 13 years. Meanwhile, an Australian woman, 15th-seeded Ashleigh Barty, plays on into the quarterfinals, her mellow and modest manner perhaps making up for the men’s maddening mayhem.","And a lot of that mayhem has to do with Hewitt, who retired with considerable fanfare at the 2016 Australian Open and segued into a new role as the Davis Cup captain. But his debut in that role was dominated by infighting, with Tomic, in a midmatch rant to Hewitt, accusing his teammate Nick Kyrgios of faking an illness. Hewitt, in turn, failed to quell Tomic’s ire.","Last Monday, Tomic accused Hewitt of a litany of misdeeds as Davis Cup captain, including giving preferential treatment to players with whom he had management deals and continuing to play doubles tournaments and in the Davis Cup as well.",Tomic said he and others did not want to play Davis Cup anymore because Hewitt “has ruined the system.”,"“Go away,” he added. “Literally, if he is retired, why is he still in tennis? Why do you play these doubles tournaments?”","Hewitt entered the men’s doubles events in Brisbane, Sydney and the Australian Open this month.","Rather than defuse the flames, Hewitt fanned them in his own extraordinary news conference after his loss in Melbourne on Thursday night. He accused Tomic of unspecified threats and “blackmail” against him and his family, essentially giving up any hope of working with Tomic again.","“We’re trying to set cultural standards for the Davis Cup and representing Australia; he hasn’t really been close to those in the last couple of years,” Hewitt said.","Hewitt said that Tomic “won’t play Davis Cup while I have anything to do with it,” but that his relationship with Kyrgios, another controversy-prone Australian, was “salvageable.”","“All I want guys to do is to commit to the sport and work hard, to want to play for Australia,” Hewitt said. “I don’t think that’s too much to ask.”","Tomic, 26, and Kyrgios, 23, were junior Grand Slam champions and undeniable talents whose professional careers have been a mix of bright spots and bad moments, with both players seeming to relish the chance to challenge the idealistic Australian notion as to how a sportsman should conduct himself.","Kyrgios, who also lost in the first round of this tournament, mostly mocked the questions he received about Tomic and Hewitt in his post-match news conference last Tuesday. He did not pick a side.","But it was clear Kyrgios also had soured on Hewitt after he posted a picture on Instagram on Wednesday of Hewitt watching Alex de Minaur, the recent Sydney champion who has become his protégé, and implying that Hewitt would not be watching any other Australian player.","Hewitt, 37, responded by saying Kyrgios’s post was “one of the standards we can’t put up with.”","“Just for the culture of Australian tennis moving forward, can’t do it,” Hewitt added. “I don’t think it’s a good look. I’ve spoken to Nick about it. He understands that. Whether he learns from it, that’s another thing.”","On Sunday, Kyrgios posted a photo of himself with de Minaur on Twitter, seeming to clarify that any bad blood is strictly intergenerational.","De Minaur, 19, is currently the highest-ranked Australian man, at No. 29. He has a game built on dazzling defense, with some of the flashiest footwork on tour. Increasingly, he is presented as a golden boy of the sport in contrast to the ne’er-do-wells Tomic and Kyrgios. De Minaur is so committed to playing for Australia that he has “109” tattooed on his chest because he was the 109th player to represent the country in Davis Cup.","As all of this was playing out, Matt Dwyer, the chief tennis officer of Tennis Australia, got involved, too, issuing a statement on Friday that highlighted de Minaur, Alex Bolt and 19-year-old Alexei Popyrin, all of whom made the third round here, and praising “each player’s unwavering passion to compete and their genuine love of the game, all underpinned by the Tennis Australia values of excellence, loyalty, teamwork and humility.’’","“Support and opportunities will be offered to players who live these values and demonstrate the commitment to maximize their potential, with our ultimate ambition being to develop and foster athletes we can all be proud of,’’ the statement added.",The statement did not mention Tomic and Kyrgios.,"Other talented Australian boys have fallen short in recent years. Omar Jasika, who won the 2014 United States Open in boys’ singles and doubles, received a two-year ban last year after testing positive for cocaine.","Oliver Anderson, the 2016 Australian Open boys’ singles champion, served a 19-month provisional suspension for match-fixing for deliberately losing a set in a 2017 match.","There has also been recent tragedy: Todd Reid, the 2002 Wimbledon boys’ singles champion, died in October at 34.","Asked if he was uncomfortable with the good-kids-versus-bad-kids narrative that predominates Australian men’s tennis, de Minaur demurred.","“There’s a lot of stuff that happens off court, but I think at the end of the day what I really want is to be that boring guy that lets his tennis do the talking, you know?” he said. “I want everyone to know that I’m that kid that’s going to leave it all out there, fight till the end, and just continuously want to improve. If I’m that boring guy in the media, then I’m doing something right.”","De Minaur has been able to stay away from the fray by making his base in Alicante, Spain. After soundly beating de Minaur in the third round, Rafael Nadal said he wished Tomic and Hewitt could learn from de Minaur’s aversion to advertising adversity.","“Will be more normal if they sit and they talk,” Nadal said, “more than do this thing here in the media.”","As Hewitt lurched toward the end of a news conference that John McEnroe described as “pouring gasoline on the fire,” he did not deny that there was toxicity in the men’s tennis culture in Australia. But he insisted that there were good stories, too, including John Millman’s upset of Roger Federer at the 2018 United States Open","For Hewitt, the most disappointing part was that the comments of a first-round loser overshadowed other Australian players’ victories.","“It’s one clown making a silly comment, and that’s the main news,” Hewitt said as his packed news conference stretched into its 14th minute."
How Are Ties Broken in Tennis? That Depends - The New York Times,"Difficult as it might be to remember at this time-is-money stage in tennis, the sport once had no tiebreakers.","Long ago, every set had to be won by a two-game margin and theoretically had no finish line. Which meant that at Wimbledon in the first round of the men’s singles in 1969, the great but aging Pancho Gonzales defeated Charlie Pasarell by the score of 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9 in a two-day match that lasted five hours and 12 minutes.","The tiebreaker was introduced to Grand Slam tennis the following year at the 1970 United States Open, with red flags being flown courtside whenever a set reached 6-6.",It has taken 49 more years for the major tournaments to reach the awkward phase where all four use different methods to resolve deciding sets in singles.,"The red flags are long gone, but the novelty effect is back. The Australian Open, which begins on Monday, will use a best-of-18-point tiebreaker at 6-6 in deciding sets, which are third sets for the women and fifth sets for the men.","Later this year, Wimbledon will introduce a conventional best-of-12-point tiebreaker at 12-12. That will leave the French Open as the only Grand Slam tournament that uses no deciding-set tiebreaker in singles.","“I think the International Tennis Federation, the ATP and the Grand Slams should find, more or less, some consistency of the rules for the understanding of the public,” Guy Forget, the French Open tournament director, said in an interview. Consistency and mutual understanding seem particularly elusive at this fractious stage of the game.",The Grand Slam leaders meet regularly and have usually made a big effort to project unity in the last 30 years as their tournaments have grown and prospered. But they have squabbled much more often lately.,"There have been disputes about the possible introduction of in-match coaching, which Wimbledon’s leadership continues to oppose. There have been disagreements about the new Laver Cup team event, which the Australian Open and U.S. Open are formally backing.","It seems symbolic that, with the Australian Open’s switch from Wilson to Dunlop, each of the four Grand Slam tournaments is using balls manufactured by a different company this year.","Breaking ranks over tiebreakers is the latest sign of the times, even if it hardly seems a major offense.","Other sports also lack consensus. Consider men’s golf, which has four majors of its own and four ways of resolving ties at the top of the leaderboard after 72 holes.","Despite any confusion, fans still seem quite capable of enjoying golf. Tennis fans surely will end up feeling the same even if tiebreakers in their sport are a great deal more common than golf playoffs.","Top tennis players had best remain alert, however.","“I’m O.K. with any format, really,” said Roger Federer, the Swiss superstar who remains a traditionalist on some fronts, including in-match coaching. “The funny thing is we have different formats now in four different Slams, so it’s just important to remind yourself when you do get to 6-all in the fifth, what’s going on here now? Do you remember which one it is?”","For women, that internal dialogue will come at 6-all in the third set even if there has been little concern about the length of Grand Slam women’s matches, which are all best-of-three sets.","“I was enjoying it, because you have to go far, and you don’t know how the score will be at the end,” said Angelique Kerber, who lost a taut Australian Open semifinal to Simona Halep last year 6-3, 4-6, 9-7. “I will miss it, for sure, but I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad rule change. We will see.”","One wonders what Jimmy Van Alen would think of it all. It was Van Alen, a wealthy American, who pushed for brisker, innovative formats — including the tiebreaker — in the 1960s. Van Alen, a former play who died in 1991, was also one of the driving forces in creating the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.","“Jimmy Van Alen would not have liked the confusion of different ways of concluding matches at the four Grand Slam events,” said Steve Flink, an American tennis historian who met Van Alen several times.","Van Alen’s idea of a sudden-death tiebreaker managed to change the game in earnest — a best-of-nine-point duel with a winner-take-all point at 4-4, which in a decisive set could give both players a match point simultaneously.","This was the tiebreaker the U.S. Open adopted for all sets in 1970 at 6-6 but abandoned in 1975 in favor of the best-of-12-point tiebreaker that had to be won by two and seemed, to the players, less of a lottery. Wimbledon embraced the best-of-12-point tiebreaker in 1971, but chose to use it at 8-8 instead of 6-6.","“I guess tennis has always had some inexplicable inconsistencies with formats and scoring systems,” Flink said.","Wimbledon maintained its scoring system until 1979, when it opted for tiebreakers at 6-6, waiting 40 years before adopting a decisive-set tiebreaker at 12-12 after last year’s semifinal between Kevin Anderson and John Isner (Anderson finally won, 26-24, in the fifth set on Centre Court, disrupting the tournament’s schedule).","“I know Jimmy Van Alen was dismayed when his original sudden death nine-point tiebreaker was discarded,” Flink said. “But I have no doubt he would have preferred the Australian Open fifth-set tiebreaker to what Wimbledon is doing. Waiting until 12-12 in the fifth would not have suited him at all.”","But for this year at least, the French Open remains the last Grand Slam holdout, a decision Forget said came about because, unlike Wimbledon, the French Open had not had an ultramarathon final set in recent seasons.","“We will not go with the tiebreak for now,” Forget said. “But I hope personally that our sport will adopt new rules in the future as we need to modernize our game a bit.”"

Roger Federer Struggles With Serena Williams’s Serve. And Vice Versa. - The New York Times,"PERTH, Australia — After nearly two decades of appearing alongside each other on billboards and in record books, Serena Williams and Roger Federer faced off across a tennis court for the first time on Tuesday.","The incandescent stars, now both 37, finally aligned for the first time by taking part in a mixed doubles match between the United States and Switzerland at the Hopman Cup team event.","On the opening point, Williams pulled Federer wide to his forehand side with a sharply angled volley, then sent a smash toward the opposite corner that he could not reach in time to send back. Long exchanges between the two proved few, however, with each using their serve to effectively neutralize the other.","It did not seem to matter to the crowd of 14,064 in Perth Arena, the highest single-session attendance in the event’s 31-year history, and Williams and Federer clearly delighted in the chance to hit the ball around with each other a couple of weeks before more serious play occurs at the Australian Open.","“It was a great experience,” Williams said as she joined Federer on court after the match. “I’m kind of sad it’s over. It was just warming up.”","Federer and his partner, Belinda Bencic, beat Williams and Frances Tiafoe in an abbreviated format match by the score of 4-2, 4-3 (5-3) in 46 minutes.","Despite the initial, promising exchange in the first set, Williams and Federer seemed to settle into more conservative play; in the entire first set, neither Federer nor Williams succeeded in making a single return off the other’s serve.","(There were, technically, two other people on the court as well. Bencic hit a pivotal return winner off Tiafoe’s serve that helped Switzerland take the lead in the first set.)","Federer and Williams both gained more of a foothold on the other’s serve in the second set, which was highlighted by a six-shot exchange of powerful cross-court groundstrokes between the two before Federer won the point by ripping a forehand toward Tiafoe.",Williams and Federer afterward sized each other up.,"“I was nervous returning, because you just don’t know,” Federer said. “People talk about her serve so much, and I see why it is such a wonderful serve, because you just can’t read it.”","“I can’t read yours either,” Williams interjected, laughing.","“We have the same qualities, you know?” Federer said.","“Yours is a bit better,” he added, provoking a good-natured eye roll from Williams.","“It was great, great fun,” Federer added. “She’s a great champion — you see how focused and determined she is — and I love that about her.”",Williams eagerly reciprocated.,"“I mean, the guy is great, he’s the greatest of all time, to be honest,” Williams said, drawing applause from the crowd (Williams has said she doubted she could beat Federer in a singles match).","“He has a killer serve,” she said. “Literally, you can’t read it, and there’s a reason why he’s the greatest, because you can’t be that great and not have an awesome weapon like that serve.”","That Williams’s serve would prove daunting to one of the best men’s players is no surprise, especially one day after she had sent a clean ace past the reach of 6-foot 4-inch Stefanos Tsitsipas in a mixed doubles match.","“Like I had any chance of returning that one,” Tsitsipas wrote on Twitter, replying to an image of the serve spinning well beyond his reach.","After Williams insisted that they hold rackets during an on-court selfie, she and Federer walked back to their seats with their arms wrapped around each other, and Federer said his racket was hers to keep.","As she carried it into the players’ area of Perth Arena alongside Tiafoe, Williams stared at the racket with visible wonderment, showing it to her partner and letting him hold it briefly.","“I was so excited,” Williams told reporters. “Literally, it was the match of my career. I don’t know, just playing someone so great, and someone that you admire so much — and a match that actually means something. It’s not often that that happens.”","The mixed doubles win gave the tie to Switzerland, who are the defending champions after Federer and Bencic won the competition last year. Switzerland will qualify for Saturday’s final if it beats Greece on Thursday in Group B. The United States, which lost to Greece on Monday, can not advance.","Williams, meanwhile, expressed mild disappointment at her play, especially considering her superior doubles pedigree of 16 Grand Slam titles to Federer’s none.","“I’m the one that won those doubles Grand Slams, but it didn’t look like it,” she said.","Williams said she had been tempted to bring her 16-month old daughter, Olympia, to the match. She ultimately decided against that, settling for having an unforgettable story to tell her.","“Men and women’s tennis just don’t compete against each other,” she said. “So it’s just really great and special to go against the greatest of all time.”","After this summit of superstars, Federer could tell his children the same thing."
"Serena Williams Is Back at Australian Open, for Tennis and So Much More - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — The last time Serena Williams came here for the Australian Open, in 2017, the talk swirling around her focused on tennis. Could she capture her 23rd major title and break past Steffi Graf on the list of Grand Slam title winners since the sport went professional?","She did indeed emerge victorious, beating her sister Venus in the final and doing so, she would later reveal to the world, while in the early stages of pregnancy.","On Tuesday, Williams returns to the sunbaked Melbourne courts, with her 16-month-old daughter in tow, bidding for another place in the record books. This time, though, her tennis is nearly an afterthought.","Four months ago, in the final of the United States Open, Williams’s most compelling moments came during angry outbursts against the umpire that won both praise and criticism, propelling an already epochal athlete to the very forefront of debates about sports and gender, race and power.","That flare-up is still being frequently discussed as the Australian Open begins this week, though Williams herself is not expected to speak to reporters before she plays.","“Serena has actually expanded her presence in people’s lives,” Delia Douglas, a Canadian sociologist who studies women in athletics, said in an interview. “The way people talk about her, the way people debate her and what she stands for, is now heightened.”",Her tennis is certainly still part of the discussion.,"“We all know Serena is very dangerous when she’s fit and when she’s healthy,” said Chris Evert, the former world No. 1 who is now an analyst for ESPN.","But just as many, if not more, focus on what Williams means.","As Soraya Chemaly, a prominent feminist activist and social critic, explained: She fits perfectly in these times, “when so much of what is happening in our world is related to gender and race and power. And right now, you can see it. Serena is sitting at that nexus, at the very intersection of all these important social conversations.”","The powerful combination of her celebrity, the internet and social media amplifies the discussion each year she continues to play, threatening to overshadow the tournaments she plays in.","The last time she played the Australian Open, she was pregnant. Eight months later, she nearly died during childbirth. She named her baby girl Alexis Olympia. Months afterward, she married her daughter’s father, Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of the popular website Reddit.","Williams, same as ever, did not shy from attention — or from making a point. She shared her story publicly and said she was experiencing the same troubles faced by many other mothers. In her first Grand Slam tournament after childbirth, the 2018 French Open, she was not in shape, and she withdrew with an injury in the fourth round. She wore a sleek, black, full-body tennis suit. It was part fashion statement, part medical necessity — it reduced the chances of a recurrence of blood clots she experienced during childbirth.","But the “cat suit,” as it came to be called, was so controversial that French tennis officials discussed banning outfits like it from Roland Garros in the future. (As a countermove, the WTA, which governs the women’s tour apart from the Grand Slams, clarified its rules to allow compression garments to be worn without skirts or dresses over them.)","Undeterred, Williams spoke pointedly at Wimbledon about protecting rights of new mothers — on the tour and in the workplace. She marched through the draw. But, still out of shape, she lost in the final. A few weeks later, she withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Montreal, eventually citing postpartum depression, a condition that afflicts about 15 percent of all mothers but is often dogged by stigma.",Then came the United States Open.,"Nobody here in Melbourne has forgotten what happened during the women’s singles final. Carlos Ramos, the umpire, spotted Williams’s coach motioning at her to be more aggressive. Ramos warned about a coaching infraction. Williams shouted with an angry, unyielding insistence that she had done nothing wrong, that she would never cheat.","Nobody has forgotten the smashed racket, the point deducted as a penalty, her continued shouting: “You’re a thief,” she defiantly yelled at Ramos.","Nor has anybody forgotten the game taken away as another penalty, Williams’s assertion that male players often behave badly and get away with it, the booing and the tumult, and finally her surprising loss to Naomi Osaka, a rising star who may threaten her again in this tournament.","Admirers praised Williams for showing courage, for being willing to stand up to a man, for being a black woman ready to argue her point in front of everyone, for enduring long years of racial slights, for engaging boldly nonetheless — and for never losing any of her fire. (A cartoon with racist imagery lampooning Williams in an Australian newspaper shortly after the U.S. Open was yet another reminder of those slights.)","Critics saw her as unhinged. This had nothing to do with womanhood or being African-American, they said. To them, she had behaved like a spoiled and raving maniac. More than that, they claimed, she had obscured the performance of a lifetime by Osaka, who had played remarkably from the start.","But who could be surprised that Osaka got short shrift? Win or lose, the talk is almost always about Serena.","Chemaly, the social critic, noted how, during a tour for her new book, “Rage Becomes Her,” “people kept bringing up Serena.”",The book urges women to be unafraid of showing rightful anger.,Chemaly said she had been asked: “‘What do you think of Serena Williams?’ ‘What does she mean for this moment?’ ‘How would you compare what happened at the U.S. Open to Brett Kavanaugh’” and the anger he displayed before a Congressional panel?,"“People really want to think about what it means,” Chemaly said.","During 2018, Williams, 37, went without a major title for the first time since 2011 (she skipped the Australian Open in 2018, still recovering from giving birth in September 2017), and she did not play another tournament after the U.S. Open.","But this is a new year. Based on her play during a string of exhibition matches in Perth — where fans greeted her warmly — and during practices this week in Melbourne, she looks primed to win again.","If she does, she’ll have achieved yet another milestone: a 24th major singles title, tying the former Australian great Margaret Court, whose Grand Slam championships came in both the amateur and professional eras.","“She seems fitter than last year,” Evert said of Williams. “The scary thought, looking at the women — they have to be thinking at this point, ‘Gosh, she was 60-70 percent last year, reaching two Grand Slam finals. And now she seems fitter, leaner. She’s moving better. She’s fresher.”","People are talking. “She’s so controversial now, everyone here will be paying close attention to that first match,” one local fan, Jess Stow, 34, said, echoing a commonly heard sentiment as she walked with her 2-year-old son near the Australian Open grounds a day before play was set to begin. “What will she end up saying?”","But so far Williams hasn’t said much. In Perth, she avoided discussion of the U.S. Open partly by keeping her news briefing to just a few minutes.","She did tell GQ Magazine in November that Ramos, the umpire at the U.S. Open, should have defused the contretemps by telling her about the signals from her coach before punishing her. It would have let her set things straight without the penalty, she said.","“Tell me that something’s happening,” she said, and she would tell her coaching box, “‘Whatever you’re doing, don’t.’”","Otherwise, she has held her peace in Melbourne. Her racket may offer her most meaningful reply."

"Radu Albot, Trained on Wooden Courts of Moldova, Earns His Country’s First Title - The New York Times","DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — As Radu Albot became the first player from Moldova to win an ATP title on Sunday, his small home country in Eastern Europe was holding parliamentary elections.","Unlike four years ago, when he was in France for a tennis tournament and spent about $200 on a taxi to the Moldovan Embassy so he could cast a ballot, Albot said he could not make his way to a voting booth on Sunday.","This time, he was busy in the Delray Beach Open final, where he held off Dan Evans to capture the title, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7), and earn $97,490, the biggest payday of his career.","Albot, 29, has been on tour for more than a decade but is only now hitting his stride. Entering the Delray Beach Open he was ranked No. 82 in the world, just off his career high of No. 81, set nearly two years ago. With the win over Evans, in which he saved three match points, Albot moved to a new career high of No. 52.","Albot is the first player, man or woman, from Moldova to be ranked within the world’s top 100. Most have never broken the top 300.","Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of 3.55 million, is better known for producing wine than tennis players. It has, however, had its share of Olympic wrestlers, Nordic skiers and soccer players. Natalia Levchenkova placed eighth in biathlon at the 2006 Winter Olympics.","At the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, 23 Moldovan athletes competed, including Albot, the country’s first Olympic tennis player. He beat Teymuraz Gabashvili of Russia in the first round before losing to Marin Cilic of Croatia. In those Games, one Moldovan, a flat-water canoeist named Oleg Tarnovschi, won the country’s only medal, a bronze that was later stripped because he violated antidoping rules.","The next-highest-ranked male player from Moldova, the 36-year-old Roman Borvanov, reached No. 200 back in 2011. Now a teaching pro near Miami, he was in Albot’s players’ box cheering for his countryman on Sunday.","“In a way, coming from this country, the results I’ve had, it’s a miracle,” Albot said. Unlike players in countries that host a Grand Slam and have a history of producing star players, he said, he had no Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi in front of him as role models and challenges.","“Then you have a goal, you want to be as them,” Albot said. “Me, growing up, I had nobody ahead of me except the guy ranked 200. I wanted to be as him, better than him. But as soon as I got to 190, then what? I didn’t know how to go higher. I didn’t have someone to ask how to get there, to go to for advice. I had to build my game by myself.”","When Albot was 6, his father, Vladimir, saw a tennis match on television and decided he wanted his only child to play the sport. Vladimir Albot was able to arrange for his son to train at a school that specialized in tennis — a government-funded academy near the family’s home in Chisinau, the Moldovan capital. The club has eight outdoor red-clay courts and two indoor courts. Until recently, those courts were made of wooden planks, but they have been converted to a hardcourt surface.","Though his parents were of modest means — Radu still lives with them in the two-room apartment they own — Vladimir traveled with Radu to junior tournaments while his mother, Svetlana, stayed home to work in her dental therapy practice. Vladimir sold some property he owned to fund his son’s travel.","Rather than spend money on hotel rooms, the pair would often sleep on mattresses inside gyms connected to the clubs where Radu competed, Albot said. Whenever Radu was offered a chance to share a room with another competitor, his father would pitch a tent for himself in the tournament parking lot.","At 13, Albot was playing in Germany, and he met Jimmy Oganezov, a local businessman from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia who had become a tennis coach. Oganezov invited Albot to spend the summer living and training with him in Wiesbaden. That summer turned into more than a dozen summers, and the training convinced Albot that he could have a career as a professional tennis player.","Moldova’s tennis federation generates little sponsorship money for its players, Albot said.","“It’s a little disappointing because in some countries, like the U.S. and France, they get so much help, like sponsors and wild cards,” said Albot, who has a German manager and one sponsorship deal, with Yonex for rackets, clothing and shoes.","“I was not the spoiled kid who got millions at 19 years old,” he said, “but, on the other hand, maybe that’s what makes me stronger.”","Albot had a 12-23 record in tour-level matches last year, including a semifinal finish in Metz, France. This year he has a 10-4 record in five tournaments, including a semifinal finish in Montpellier, France, and the title in Delray Beach. He will next play the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, Calif., and in Miami.","When his playing career is over, Albot would like to return to Moldova and help build the next generation of tennis players. He knows it won’t be easy.","The country is among the poorest in Europe, and Sunday’s election has not delivered a conclusive result. There have been accusations of fraud that further threaten the country’s efforts to stabilize.","Still, Albot has hope.","“I don’t want to finish my career and see that tennis is dead in my country,” he said, adding, “I want to walk into every tournament and see the Moldovan flag flying.”"
"Relocated From a Park to a Football Stadium, the Miami Open Emphasizes Luxury - The New York Times","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans.","Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross’s Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket.","“Larry’s done a great job,” Ross said. “He set the bar high, and it’s all great for tennis. But for us, it’s more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way.”","Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.","That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go.","Rather than see the tournament — and its hundreds of millions in local revenue — uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue.",The move wasn’t well received by everyone.,"“Key Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can’t beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,” said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. “We had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me.”","At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts — all permanent — were built on top of parking lots.","On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon’s Henman Hill, minus the grass.","The change recalls the United States Open’s move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.","“This place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,” said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins’ chief executive. “We are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L.”","Tournament organizers did not take the word “luxury” lightly. The stadium court — painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue — seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court.","Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million.","Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis.","“There’s a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,” said James Blake, the tournament director.","Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls.","“I had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,” said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan’s Hudson Yards project. “It’s all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they’re watching for those details.”","The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.","The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men’s and women’s singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages.","But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians.","“What we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,” said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG’s parent company. “Key Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we’ve got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we’re the new U.S. Open.”"
Miami Open: Roger Federer and John Isner Fend Off Phenoms to Reach Final - The New York Times,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — By reaching the semifinals of the Miami Open, the Canadian youngsters Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov achieved something that Roger Federer and John Isner never managed.","Federer, for all his obvious and precocious tennis talents, never made it to this late a stage of a Masters 1000 event in singles as a teenager. Isner was still a student-athlete at the University of Georgia in his late teens.","But neither Auger-Aliassime, 18, nor Shapovalov, 19, was able to make the next leap on Friday as Isner and Federer took turns holding back youth on the temporary center court at Hard Rock Stadium.","Federer, 37, and Isner, 33, will now play an old-guard final on Sunday.","On Friday afternoon, Isner was opportunistic in his 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4) victory against the silken Auger-Aliassime. In the evening, Federer was brilliant in his 6-2, 6-4 demolition of Shapovalov, a flashy left-hander with a one-handed backhand who grew up idolizing Federer and now has a much clearer understanding of what it is like to face him.","“I just think he has every shot mastered,” Shapovalov said. “When he needs a shot, he’s going to make it. He’s going to go for it. He’s going to make it. I don’t think he has any weaknesses. That’s why he’s the G.O.A.T,” the greatest of all time.","Federer has had more vulnerable moments in his career and even one this month when Dominic Thiem, another younger man with a forceful one-handed backhand, defeated him to win the title in Indian Wells on March 17.","But Federer has been in a very fine patch of form, successfully rebounding from his defeat to yet another member of the new wave, Stefanos Tsitsipas, in the fourth round of this year’s Australian Open.","Since then, Federer is 15-1, all on hardcourts.","Auger-Aliassime is already quite a tennis package: explosive from the baseline, comfortable at the net and smooth on the move as well as in the interview room, where he can reflect in French or English.","On Friday, in the biggest match of his career, the Canadian qualifier acted his age only when it came time to close out a set.","Isner, 15 years his senior, has long been one of the game’s supreme servers. But it was Auger-Aliassime’s own serve that proved his undoing.","Up by 5-4 and serving for the first set, Auger-Aliassime produced his first three double faults of the match and lost his edge.","“For sure, nerves,” Auger-Aliassime said. “It was like I caught a virus or something.”","Up by 5-3 and serving for the second set, he double faulted and knocked a midcourt forehand swing volley into the tape on break point.","He was soon back in another tiebreaker with Isner, for whom tiebreakers are as natural a habitat as a swamp is to a gator.","Isner has played 49 sets this year. More than half (26) have ended in tiebreakers, a reflection of his phenomenal serve and his limitations as a returner.","Though Isner had a losing record in 2019 tiebreakers before this tournament, he has gone 9-0 in the Miami Open.","“I’m just finding myself pretty calm in those situations; maybe it’s a little bit mental,” Isner said. “I’m just definitely playing my best tennis when I’ve been in that situation this week. There is no doubt.”","Isner’s defeat of Auger-Aliassime put him one victory from defending the most significant title of his career. Isner won this Masters 1000 tournament last season, when it was played about 20 miles south of Miami Gardens, on the upscale island of Key Biscayne and with a permanent main stadium.","This year, the tournament moved to the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.","“A completely different feel than last year, obviously,” Isner said.","There are clear benefits to the shift in site: more spacious and luxurious facilities for fans and players; a less congested commute; a fine vibe on the outside courts despite complaints about insufficient seating. Above all there is the fact that this event, traditionally one of the most prestigious outside the four Grand Slam events, has remained in the United States and in the tennis hotbed of South Florida rather than being moved outside the country, which has been the case for other United States-based tournaments in the past 20 years.","But the downside for now is that the main stadium often has a low-energy atmosphere, and though ticket sales have been brisk, fewer than half of the seats were occupied when Isner and Auger-Aliassime began play shortly after 1 p.m.",The noise and age gap were more pronounced in the second semifinal. Federer is 37. Shapovalov is 19 and was not even born when Federer played his first main-draw match at the Miami Open in 1999.,"Federer mentioned that fun fact before the match to his twin daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, who are 9: closer to Shapovalov’s age than their father.","“They were like: ‘What? Hold on a second!’ ” Federer said. “I did the calculation, and they were like, ‘So this guy is really young?’ ”","Federer responded by telling them he was “really old,” but he certainly did not move like it against Shapovalov, who had practiced with him but never played against him in earnest.","Federer improvised and covered the corners impressively, slashing forehand and backhand winners and hitting deft, precise volleys. The only relative disappointment: a first-serve percentage below 50 percent. But Federer made the most of his first serves, winning 91 percent of the points and avoiding being broken.","“I think I played very well; I had to,” Federer said. “Because I think when you let Denis play, he’s got some serious power and he gets the rhythm going and he can really put you in some uncomfortable situations.”","So, in a very different vein, can Isner."
An Amateur’s Hour - The New York Times,"One recent morning, Jack Ming Jie Lin, a Columbia University tennis player, informed his chemistry professor that he needed to reschedule Tuesday night’s lab because he had another engagement.","“Look,” he said he told his professor, “I have a very important match Feb. 12 and I understand that we’re supposed to have lab session that Tuesday night, but unfortunately, I can’t make it that night.”","Instead of chemistry class, Lin, a 19-year-old sophomore, will be playing his first ATP Tour main-draw match, at the New York Open at Nassau Coliseum. Lin earned a wild card into the first round of the professional event by winning a college invitational in November at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Thirty-two players from 16 New York-area universities, including Army, Cornell, Princeton and St. John’s, competed in the tournament, where Lin beat Alafia Ayeni of Cornell, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 7-6 (5), in a final that lasted three and a half hours.",Lin’s appearance at the New York Open is a rare opportunity for an amateur to test himself against the pros.,"“The Knicks can never play a team like St. John’s in a game that actually counts,” said Peter Lebedevs, the assistant tournament director for the New York Open. “In this, it is the pros playing a collegiate player, and it counts for both of them. For a kid like Jack, it’s an opportunity to get points and to get started on a potential pro career after his college or during the summer.”","A native of Markham, Ontario, Lin ended the fall at No. 4 in the collegiate doubles rankings with his playing partner, William Matheson, and is No. 40 in singles. He helped Columbia reach the round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament last season after the Lions won the Ivy League for the fifth year in a row. He owns victories over the current pros Taylor Fritz of the United States and Denis Shapovalov of Canada, but those came in the junior ranks. Shapovalov is ranked No. 25 in the world, and Fritz No. 40.","“Obviously seeing them both develop into such big-time players, I don’t think I’m at their level yet with the results that they’ve been having,” said Lin, who grew up near Shapovalov, 19, in the Toronto suburbs. “I’m just more content with my own improvement over every month.”","The New York Open will feature many top American player, including John Isner, Frances Tiafoe, Steve Johnson and Sam Querrey. The former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt is playing doubles, as are Bob and Mike Bryan.","Lin will play a qualifier on Tuesday, and if he wins, he would face Johnson, ranked 34th. Some of Lin’s Columbia teammates want him to face a top player to see how he matches up.","“I want to watch Jack play against one of the high-caliber guys to see the difference between the ATP guys and the level in college,” said the junior Jackie Tang, who plays for the Hong Kong Davis Cup team in addition to competing for Columbia. ",“I think he’ll do well because I don’t think the gap is that big. I think it’s just the experience and the knowledge of how to play certain points correctly.”,"John McEnroe, who played a year at Stanford, has been a supporter of college tennis, pointing out that top-10 players like Isner and Kevin Anderson have had pro success at older ages after maturing while playing college tennis. Most recently, Danielle Collins, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion at Virginia, advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open at 25.","Lin said: “Honestly, I think college tennis is the best it’s ever been. There are so many transitional players playing at such a high level.”","Lin’s mother, Sally Yi, is set to come from Toronto, and many of Lin’s coaches and teammates plan to root him on as well. ","“I love these play-in formats where it’s not just arbitrarily granting a wild card to somebody,” said the former American star Andy Roddick, who kicked off the tournament on Saturday with an exhibition match against Jim Courier. “It’s a good story that somebody came in and earned it and this is what you get for your troubles.",“What’s better than being able to work your way into the matches that you dream about?”,Roddick joked that he would advise Lin not to take the prize money so that he can remain an amateur. Lin has not planned that far ahead.,"“Obviously, playing the event’s not really about the prize money,” he said. “It’s just more about getting the opportunity to play in front of everybody on such a big stage and play against the top guys on the ATP level just to assess what my level is.”","At 5-foot-11, Lin is short for a sport where more than half of the men’s top-15 players are at least 6-4. But he is a shotmaker and is working on becoming more aggressive by coming to net more."," Lin, who hopes to someday be a top-100 player on the ATP Tour, considers himself part of the rising wave of Canadian players that includes Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime. He played for Canada’s Davis Cup team, but opted to come to the United States to focus on academics and tennis.","“In Canada, there are a lot of great universities there too, but they kind of lack the competition in tennis of playing in the States,” he said. “Playing N.C.A.A. tennis, it allows me to continue developing my game and obviously at the same time pursue my academic goals.”","Balancing the two sets of goals has been a battle. The men’s tennis team as a whole carries a 3.74 grade point average, and Lin does not want to let his teammates down.","“There’s a lot of things going on, but he’s managing,” said Bid Goswami, in his 37th season as the Columbia tennis coach. “He doesn’t want to be left behind in his studies. He had a really good last two semesters.”","As for that chemistry lab, Lin suggested to his professor that he move it to Wednesday night, but if he wins on Tuesday, he won’t be able to make that session, either. He’ll be back on the court playing his second-round match at the New York Open.","In fact, he would have several schedule conflicts to manage. The Columbia team is flying to Chicago on Wednesday for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association national championships, which begin Friday. ","“If Jack wins his first match on Tuesday night and misses our flight to Chicago for national indoors,” the Columbia assistant Howard Endelman said, “that’s a good problem to have.”"
Will Naomi Osaka Pick Japanese Citizenship or American? Her Deadline to Choose Is Looming - The New York Times,"TOKYO — If anyone can stir Japanese national pride at the moment, it is Naomi Osaka.","The world’s No. 1-ranked player in women’s tennis, Ms. Osaka is among the biggest stars in Japan, splashed across television programs and advertisements for Nissan cars and Citizen watches. As a mixed-race person, she has also helped prompt a discussion about how Japanese see their country.","But a looming deadline — Ms. Osaka’s 22nd birthday in October — has raised the question of whether she can continue to represent Japan on the international tennis circuit, where she has given the country bragging rights on the world sports stage.","Ms. Osaka, whose mother is Japanese and father is Haitian-American, has citizenship in both Japan and the United States. Under Japanese law, dual citizens must choose between the two nationalities by the time they turn 22.","That legal clause has left fans and commentators trying to guess whether Ms. Osaka will pick citizenship in Japan, the country of her birth, or the United States, where she has lived since she was a young child.","The choice facing Ms. Osaka comes as Japan is under pressure to loosen its entrenched insularity. Japan has long prized racial purity, seeing a largely homogeneous population as crucial to social cohesion. But with the country’s population declining and employers increasingly desperate for workers, its legislature passed a law in December to admit more guest workers, starting this month.","Ms. Osaka’s case, along with the new influx of foreigners, could exert new pressure on the government to begin to bring Japanese citizenship laws in line with those in the roughly three-quarters of countries, including the United States, that allow dual citizenship.","For now, though, Ms. Osaka has a decision to make. When asked by reporters which nationality she intended to choose, she responded with trademark feistiness.","“I’m pretty sure it’s obvious,” she said at a news conference following the China Open in October. “I’m playing for Japan. Not to be disrespectful or anything, but I don’t really get where the conclusion that it’s a hard choice for me or anything comes from.”","Still, it might be hard to imagine Ms. Osaka giving up her American citizenship to keep playing under the Japanese flag. And in reality, she may not have to. Legal experts say the Japanese government rarely enforces the law requiring citizens to choose between nationalities.","The Justice Ministry estimates that about 890,000 Japanese citizens may also hold foreign passports, and the government has never revoked Japanese citizenship from anyone who, like Ms. Osaka, was granted citizenship at birth. (Japanese citizens who voluntarily naturalize in another country automatically lose their Japanese citizenship.)","But some analysts warn that because of Ms. Osaka’s celebrity, it would be difficult for the government to quietly give her a pass on dual citizenship.","“I think for the government it is a problem if she openly carries on having two passports,” said Sachiko Horiguchi, associate professor of anthropology at Temple University’s Tokyo campus. “Because that means the public would know that the law isn’t really enforced. I don’t think the government wants to admit that or the public to know that.”","Three years ago, when Renho Murata, whose father is from Taiwan, ran as the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party, right-wing critics attacked her because she had not formally relinquished her Taiwanese citizenship.","Partly in response to the frenzy over Ms. Murata, Kimi Onoda, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who was born in the United States to an American father and a Japanese mother, formally renounced her American citizenship.","Ms. Osaka’s multicultural background has challenged Japan’s notions of national identity, and she has become the most prominent mixed-race and mixed-nationality figure in a country where only one in 50 children born each year has a foreign parent. Though she is not fluent in Japanese, she has captivated the country with her whimsical remarks to the news media, as well as her humility in victory.","Her parents decided when she was young that she and her sister, who also played, would represent Japan, partly because the American tennis federation showed them little attention.","Anticipating Ms. Osaka’s citizenship choice, Michio Ushioda, a former columnist for The Mainichi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, and a professor at Teikyo University in Tokyo, said on Twitter that Japan would fall into a national funk if she elected American citizenship over Japanese.","“The disappointment of the Japanese at that time would be great,” Mr. Ushioda wrote in a tweet that only select followers could view, even suggesting that Japan’s current administration would collapse if Ms. Osaka competed for the United States in the Olympics.","Under International Olympic Committee rules, competitors must be nationals of the countries they represent. Similarly, under International Tennis Federation rules, Ms. Osaka could not play for Japan if she gave up her Japanese citizenship.","Legal experts say Japanese law provides a loophole through which dual citizens can effectively retain both nationalities. The law requires only that a Japanese citizen “endeavor to renounce” foreign nationality, a phrase that can provide just enough wiggle room for citizens to hold on to an extra passport.","“Many people misunderstand the law and feel threatened that they have to choose a nationality,” said Yasuhiro Okuda, a law professor at Chuo University.","Until 1985, Japan granted citizenship only to children whose fathers were Japanese. When it changed the law — a move it made under pressure from international critics who said the rules discriminated against women — the government added the clause stipulating that children with dual citizenship would have to choose between their passports by the time they turned 22.",Analysts say Japan’s law makes little sense in a modern world filled with multicultural citizens like Ms. Osaka.,"“It goes against Japan’s efforts to recruit and retain global talent,” said Erin Chung, a professor of East Asian politics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. “If you basically maintain the spirit of the current nationality act, that will be a huge deterrent for athletes and other members of what’s called the global talent pool to stay in Japan.”","For older generations, opening Japan to a pool of newly naturalized citizens could generate a considerable political backlash.",But younger Japanese are growing more accustomed to living and working with international neighbors and colleagues.,"“Young people in their 20s now are much more familiar with foreigners or so-called ‘hafu,’” said Satoko Takeda, a visiting researcher at Osaka University of Economics and Law, using the Japanese term, from the English word “half,” to describe those of mixed-race descent like Ms. Osaka. “They are different from previous generations. I think there is hope.”"
Bianca Andreescu Completes a Stunning Run to the Indian Wells Title - The New York Times,"INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — As part of her morning routine, the Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu finds a quiet place and visualizes success, big success.","“It’s crazy to think that it became a reality today,” she said after the roars had faded on Sunday afternoon.",Not so crazy if you observed all the shots and grit that Andreescu had to summon under duress to defeat tennis elder after tennis elder in the desert and win one of the most prestigious titles in the sport.,"But it was certainly far-fetched when you considered her lack of experience at this level and the quality of the players she had to outhit and outwit, including the three-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 Angelique Kerber, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in Sunday’s final.","Andreescu, 18, is the first wild card to win the BNP Paribas Open.","“Hopefully, this moment can be a great inspiration for many young athletes because, like I always say, if you believe in yourself, anything is possible,” Andreescu said during the award ceremony.","While she won her first tour title, Roger Federer was unable to win his 101st, losing to Dominic Thiem, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, in the men’s final later Sunday. Thiem, the No. 7 seed, reached the French Open final last year, but this Masters 1000 title was his most significant victory.",He earned it — just barely — by putting his huge baseline power and flashy one-handed backhand to work and by breaking the 37-year-old Federer at 5-5 in the third set and then holding firm.,"“I think it’s not my right to congratulate you; you have 88 more titles than me,” Thiem said to Federer, who is, nonetheless, now 2-3 against the young Austrian.","Kerber, age 31 and seeded eighth, was unable to prevail against Andreescu despite a huge edge in experience. This was Kerber’s 29th final on tour, and only Andreescu’s second. Kerber had won more than $27 million in career prize money; Andreescu had won just $350,000.","Kerber also had an apparent physical edge in the final phase of a grueling match, played in 80-degree weather. Andreescu arrived on court with her right shoulder and right forearm taped after winning six matches en route to the final.","“My shoulder has just been really, really tight,” she said. “That was more for prevention.”","She required more treatment on her arm early in the third set, but despite looking bone weary between points, crouching down and stretching repeatedly, she found the will and, above all, the patterns and talent to finish off Kerber on her fourth match point.","When it was over, Kerber kissed the teenager on both cheeks. Andreescu then crossed to the opposite side of the net, kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back, her arms and legs splayed as she basked in the sun and in one of the game’s most unexpected great performances.",Though most Canadians at home could not watch the match on terrestrial television — only streaming was available outside of Quebec — her compatriots definitely noticed.,"“Bianca Andreescu just made history. Congratulations,” Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, posted on Twitter shortly after her victory.","Women’s tennis, which is in a deeply compelling phase, has had a number of breakthrough performances of late, including Naomi Osaka’s run to the title at Indian Wells a year ago as an unseeded player, when she was 20. That presaged Osaka’s victories at the United States Open and the Australian Open and her rise to No. 1, where she remains.",Andreescu was asked if she saw that as inspiration.,"“No pressure,” she answered quickly, smiling.",Her questioner apologized.,"“It’s totally fine,” Andreescu said. “Yeah, it’s definitely inspiration seeing her claim the trophy last year, and winning two Grand Slams right after that has been amazing to see. But I don’t really want to focus on the future right now. I just want to enjoy this moment, because I don’t want to take anything for granted. You never know what next week brings. I just want to savor this.”","Next week will bring the Miami Open, where she has a first-round match scheduled against Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania, the player she had to rally to defeat in the first round in three sets at Indian Wells.","“She’s not seeded and won’t get the extra day of rest,” her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, said. “So of course it’s a challenge to go right to Miami with very little rest and with the emotions and everything. But it’s like that, and you have to go with it. It’s the learning curve and the job.”","Andreescu, the only child of Romanian immigrants, is the youngest woman to win at Indian Wells since 17-year-old Serena Williams did so in 1999.","“You just played amazing the whole tournament, so you really deserved to win the title here,” Kerber told Andreescu in her postmatch on-court remarks.","Andreescu did not emerge from obscurity. She was a highly regarded junior player who won the prestigious Les Petits As title in France, and though she was not the dominant junior at the Grand Slam level in 2016 and 2017, she did win two Grand Slam girls doubles titles.","In January, Andreescu upset Caroline Wozniacki, then No. 3 in the world, and Venus Williams to reach the final of the tour event in Auckland, New Zealand, and then qualified for the Australian Open, where she won her first Grand Slam singles match.","But her run in the California desert was still a huge leap, and the element of surprise certainly worked in her favor. The last six of her seven matches were against players she had never faced on tour: Dominika Cibulkova, Stefanie Voegele, Wang Qiang, Garbiñe Muguruza, Elina Svitolina and Kerber.","The tour’s veterans will now have a better idea of what to expect, but it will not be easy to identify areas of weakness.","Andreescu has a remarkably complete game for a player of any age, much less an 18-year-old. Despite struggling physically at times against Svitolina in their semifinal and again versus Kerber, Andreescu was still able to display her full palette of all-court skills.","“I think she has a tennis that is really complete, and on the mental side, she’s a warrior,” said Bruneau, who helped her on the mental side with some well-chosen words on coaching visits in the second and third sets on Sunday.","Andreescu can bang groundstrokes at a world-class clip or change pace abruptly with slice. She also can hit rolling, off-speed, angled winners from either wing that might well become her trademark. Time and again, she kept Kerber, a counterpuncher who thrives on consistent pace, from settling into a rhythm.","Andreescu can attack the net or defend in the corners with her foot speed and excellent footwork. She has a strong first serve and, perhaps more important in the return-focused women’s game, a solid second serve that is difficult to attack.","Andreescu also likes the drop shot, which can be a joy and a curse — as was evident against Kerber. Andreescu hit some exquisite winners and some tight, untimely errors with the risky shot. But after failing to convert three match points on her serve at 5-3 in the third set, she roared back after the changeover to break Kerber’s serve for the victory.","Ranked No. 60 before the tournament began, Andreescu will be 24th on Monday. She has more than quadrupled her career prize money, earning $1,354,010 for her victory.","Not bad, given that she still does not have a high-school degree, which she is trying to complete online.","“I’m on that, but it’s hard because after practice, that’s the last thing I want to do,” she said. “I’m just so tired, but I believe knowledge is power.”"
"Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, Leads Youth Movement at the Miami Open - The New York Times","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The story of Juan Ponce de León searching for a fountain of youth in Florida may be apocryphal, but this week at the men’s event of the Miami Open, there seems to be something revitalizing in the water.","Felix Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, is the youngest man to reach the semifinals in the tournament’s history. His compatriot and friend Denis Shapovalov, 19, will join him in the semifinals after beating the American Frances Tiafoe, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-2, in a quarterfinal Thursday evening.","Auger-Aliassime, ranked 57th, booked his spot in the semifinals with a 7-6 (3), 6-2 win over 11th-seeded Borna Coric on Wednesday night. Coric, 22, was eight years younger than the next-oldest quarterfinalist, but still far more experienced than Auger-Aliassime, who is in the main draw of a Masters event for just the fifth time.","“Playing Borna, who’s been established for a few years now, I definitely didn’t expect to win,” Auger-Aliassime said, adding that he was especially surprised with how he was able to control the second set after a grueling opening set that lasted more than an hour.","“I felt like I had margin over him, had a bit of an edge,” he added. “I just felt really comfortable out there from the first balls.”",Excitement and expectations preceded Auger-Aliassime years before he was ready for the professional tour. He was a highly touted junior by the time he turned 15; his matches on small courts at the 2015 United States Open were swarmed with scouts and sponsors.,"His potential, evident then, is clearer now. Like many in his generation, Auger-Aliassime is comfortable on all parts of the court; he hit a particularly convincing sliding forehand volley winner to extend his lead to 2-0 in the second set.","Shapovalov and Tiafoe relished knifing sharply angled drop volley winners during their match Thursday, exchanging a high-five at the net after one particularly sublime shot by Shapovalov.","The on-court flair extends to the normally rote postmatch rituals, too. Shapovalov celebrated a win in Indian Wells, Calif., by rapping several bars in his on-court interview. When Auger-Aliassime signs his initials on the TV camera lens after a win, it at first appears as if he is writing the name of a fraternity someone his age might be pledging: Gamma Lambda Lambda — “ΓΛΛ” — before striking through the letters to create a stylized “FAA.”","Ranked 182nd a year ago, Auger-Aliassime, who grew up in Montreal, broke into the top 100 after reaching the final of the ATP tournament in Rio de Janeiro in February. He is poised to be ranked 33rd on Monday and would crack the top 20 if he wins the title on Sunday.","Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov are the second and third teenagers to reach the Miami Open quarterfinals since 2007, when Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic did (Alexander Zverev did it in 2017). Murray, Djokovic and the eight teenage boys to achieve the feat before them went on to reach the No. 1 ranking and win at least one Grand Slam title. (A 17-year-old Rafael Nadal first beat Roger Federer in Miami, in 2004. He reached the final the next year.)","“Obviously it’s a privilege to be compared to all these great players,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I think it just shows that I’m doing good things, I’m on the right track.","“But, yeah, I think I’m seeing the long term, and right now I’m just enjoying every day, enjoying every match, because you never know what’s going to happen next.”",Auger-Aliassime’s success in Miami comes on the heels of another surprising run by an 18-year-old Canadian: Bianca Andreescu’s title last week in Indian Wells.,"As women’s tennis is being lifted by the breakthroughs of young players like Andreescu and Naomi Osaka, men’s tennis has been eagerly awaiting new blood as players in their 30s like Djokovic, Federer and Nadal continue to dominate the tour.","“You have a lot of newcomers with talent gunning for them, and every week it feels like someone new is making a breakthrough and playing well,” said Shapovalov. “I think it’s really healthy to see a couple new stars in the game, and the fans get to watch something new, other than the top four.”","The ATP began a campaign few years ago to highlight its “Next Gen” players; the results have been mixed. While four quarterfinalists in Miami are 22 or younger, the four others are 30 or older.","Zverev, now 21, is ranked third, but has struggled in Grand Slam tournaments. Stefanos Tsitsipas, 20, has risen to No. 10, spurred by a run to the Australian Open semifinals that included a win over Federer.","Shapovalov had his breakthrough moment at the 2017 Rogers Cup in Montreal, beating Nadal, ranked No. 1 at the time, en route to reaching the semifinals as a 17-year-old. He then reached the fourth round at the U.S. Open.","Tiafoe, 21, was in his first Masters quarterfinal, backing up his quarterfinal run at the Australian Open in January.",There is hope that this tournament is further evidence that reinforcements are finally ready to replenish the men’s tour. Tiafoe believes it’s already happening.,"“I wouldn’t say we’re ‘Next Gen,’” Tiafoe said. “I think we’re definitely here, knocking on the door to do some good things.”","Auger-Aliassime will face seventh-seeded John Isner, 33, on Friday for a spot in the final. Auger-Aliassime’s record against top players is limited but spotless: he is 5-0 against top-20 opponents.","How Auger-Aliassime’s form will translate into Grand Slam tennis played over best-of-five sets is still an open question. At last year’s U.S. Open, his only main-draw appearance at a major, he retired in the third set of his first-round match against Shapovalov because of heart palpitations.","Federer, 37, remains the oldest player in the draw. He will play his quarterfinal match against Kevin Anderson, 32, on Thursday night.","Federer turned 19 the day Auger-Aliassime was born. Federer said he enjoyed seeing members of the young generation square off against one another, particularly savoring the fourth-round match between Shapovalov and Tsitsipas, which was decided in a third-set tiebreaker.","“I loved seeing them slug it out, and I’m sure they are going to have big matches down the road,” Federer said. “I like when they also have to play each other a little bit, because they don’t look across the net and see a guy ranked whatever it is. It’s just another guy they know from the juniors, and ‘I’m just going to beat you up now.’”","WOMEN’S SEMIFINALS In a women’s semifinal that was delayed by five hours because of intermittent rain on Thursday afternoon, 12th-seeded Ashleigh Barty reached the biggest final of her career, beating 21st-seeded Anett Kontaveit 6-3, 6-3.","In the final, Barty will face fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova, who denied the No. 2 seed, Simona Halep, a win that would have returned her to the top world ranking.

Illness Knocks Serena Williams Out at Indian Wells - The New York Times,"INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — For the first three games, Serena Williams was in a deep, irresistible groove: pounding serves and ground strokes as Garbiñe Muguruza watched the winners zoom by.","Who could have known, as Williams took a quick 3-0 lead, that she would not win another game on Sunday?","With Williams visibly hampered, increasingly slow on her feet and unable to hit serves at full power, Muguruza reeled off seven straight games. Muguruza was up to a 6-3, 1-0 lead before Williams walked to her chair instead of changing ends, sitting down heavily and then retiring from this third-round match at the BNP Paribas Open.",The WTA Tour announced that the reason for Williams’s retirement was a “viral illness.”,"“Before the match, I did not feel great, and then it just got worse with every second: extreme dizziness and extreme fatigue,” Williams said in a statement released by the tournament. “By the score, it might have looked like I started well, but I was not feeling at all well physically.”","Muguruza, a tall, powerful Spaniard who is seeded 20th, said, “We played many times, and it’s always supertough and superexciting, and it’s never good to see someone not feeling well on the court.”","The retirement was the latest on-court setback for the 37-year-old Williams, who has had some remarkable results since returning to the tour last year after childbirth but has yet to win a title.","This was her second tournament of 2019 and only her third event in six months. Last September, she reached the United States Open final before losing her cool and the match to Naomi Osaka.","In January, she quickly hit plenty of high notes again on her way to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, where she rolled her left ankle while holding a 5-1, 40-30 lead in the third set against Karolina Pliskova.","Pliskova went on to save four match points in all. She won the next six games and the match, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.","It was an unprecedented Grand Slam collapse for Williams, one of the supreme competitors in the history of women’s tennis.","But Williams returned to Florida and the practice court and then returned to action at Indian Wells on Friday, playing one of the finest matches of her comeback, defeating Victoria Azarenka, 7-5, 6-3.","“We’re both moms, and we know how hard it is and how hard it’s been for us to come back, you know, and starting literally from scratch and fighting our way back,” Williams said. “It’s been an arduous road, and I think we both really appreciate both of our efforts to do the best that we can do.”","When Williams returned to Court One to face Muguruza, she was soon striking the ball as cleanly and convincingly as she had against Azarenka.","“I thought that match with Vika was such a high level of tennis from both of them,” said Kathy Rinaldi, the United States Fed Cup captain. “And today, Serena started off carrying on. It was coming off the racket, easy power and very consistent.”",It was their first meeting since Muguruza defeated Williams to win her first major singles title at the 2016 French Open.,"But Williams, back in the top 10 and seeded 10th, could not sustain her remarkable level. Muguruza raised her own, fighting to hold serve in the fourth game, breaking Williams in the next game and then ripping a series of backhand down-the-line winners to hold serve at love and even the match at 3-3.","“I think she started playing well right away, with her serve, with her shots, being very dominating,” Muguruza said. “I had to adapt a little bit my position in the court, the way I was hitting. And it took me a few games to kind of do it. Once I did it, I felt much more comfortable to be able to release my tennis.”","Williams started the seventh game with an off-balance double fault into the net and began hitting first serves consistently below 100 miles per hour. She double faulted again later in the game and barely moved as Muguruza hit a forehand winner to go ahead, 4-3.","Williams then walked very slowly to her chair and looked frustrated on the first point of the next game, taking a huge, angry cut at a forehand return that she hit into the net.","“At the end of the first set, I felt maybe she wasn’t feeling well, yeah,” Muguruza said.","Williams soon provided confirmation. After losing the set, she called for a trainer and was eventually surrounded by the tour supervisor Donna Kelso, the trainer Paige Kensrue and a tournament physician. Though Kensrue arrived on court with a blood-pressure cuff, she did not take a reading on Williams and no official medical timeout was taken.","After extended discussion, Williams returned to the court to start the second set but did not win another point as Muguruza held serve at love.","One of Williams’s signatures is that after the first game of a set, she does not change ends on the chair umpire’s side of the net, crossing over on the opposite side without approaching her own seat. But she changed her routine this time, heading straight for her chair and then retiring.",It was only Williams’s third midmatch retirement since 2009. Her next scheduled event is the Miami Open later this month.,"“I think Serena always has the confidence,” Rinaldi said. “Look at her record coming back from having baby Olympia: two finals of Grand Slams. I think she knows what she is capable of. Self-belief, I don’t think that’s an issue. Obviously today was a little bit of a setback, but I think since she came back that she has gotten better and better and stronger.”"
Danielle Collins Rolls Right Past Kerber and Into the Australian Open Quarterfinals - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Danielle Collins, who had not won a match at a Grand Slam tournament before this year, pummeled second-seeded Angelique Kerber in the fourth round on Sunday, sealing the most stunning result of the Australian Open with a 6-0, 6-2 victory that took just 55 minutes to complete.","Collins commanded the match from the beginning, dictating play by aggressively attacking, particularly with her two-handed backhand. She hit 29 winners in the match, compared to just six for Kerber.","Kerber, a three-time Grand Slam champion from Germany, had few solutions for Collins and was unable to use her counterpunching to wrest control of the match at any point.","“It was completely not my day,” Kerber said. “I was not playing the tennis that I can play. She played really well. I think she played one of her best matches, to be honest. She hit, yeah, every ball in the court.”","After losing the first set in just 20 minutes, Kerber walked off the court of Margaret Court Arena in an apparent effort to change the momentum of the match, leaving Collins grinning as she waited.","Kerber won the first two points after she returned, playing with a renewed purpose and shouts of encouragement to herself, but Collins again announced her presence in the match by screaming, “Come on!” back at Kerber after hitting a drop-shot winner on the third point.","Collins’s pugnacious attitude is well known in tennis, and something she readily acknowledges and embraces, calling it “just part of the deal with me” on court.","“I mean, you all know: I’m my own person; I’m feisty,” she said. “I love making it kind of a war. If somebody wants to get in my face on my unforced errors, I have no problem getting right back at them and making it a feisty match. I love that, embrace it. I love when things get competitive.”",The tenacity in her tennis extends to off-court pursuits as well.,"“Even karaoke — I don’t have a good voice, but I always try to do the best at whatever I’m doing,” said Collins, a 25-year-old Floridian. “If I’m not, I still tell myself I’m the best. You’ve got to believe it, right?”","That unshakability was clear as Collins closed out her victory. Kerber broke in the first game of the second set after their verbal exchange, but Collins broke back in the next game, and then pulled ahead of Kerber for good when she broke again for 4-2.","Mat Cloer, one of Collins’s coaches, said that she had played “pretty flawless” in the first set and had done what she needed to retain the momentum.","“You knew after the first set that she was going to come out and make that second push,” Cloer said of Kerber. “And she did, and Danielle handled it really, really well. She showed great composure, but also didn’t back down. She lost the first game of the second set, but she showed that she was a little fiery at Angie.”","He added: “I think that allowed her to show, ‘I’m still here, and I’m going to fight this through,’ which I think didn’t make it easy for Angie to get out of it — and Danielle just kept going.”","Collins, a two-time national champion in singles for the University of Virginia, is the first collegiate player to reach the quarterfinals of women’s singles at a Grand Slam event since Lisa Raymond at the 2004 Australian Open.","“I think going to college helped me develop myself as a person,” Collins said. “I really know who I am, the type of person I am, what I want, what I want to do with my life, what I want to do with my tennis.","“I have other interests and passions aside from tennis. I’m able to relax a little bit more, maybe, than some other people because they’ve kind of just been doing tennis their whole life, haven’t really ventured out much.”","Collins did her homework before the biggest victory of her career, watching footage of Kerber’s matches.","“I had a clear mind-set of what I was going to do,” Collins said. “From the very first point, I showed her that I wasn’t going to let her into the match, that I was going to dictate the entire way through. I stuck to my game plan. It clearly worked out well for me, pretty much smooth sailing throughout the entire thing. I was just feeling really great.”","Collins has been a quick study in the elite levels of professional tennis. Ranked 162nd a year ago, she broke through with a run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last March, beating Venus Williams en route.","Collins, now No. 35 in the rankings, will face 44th-ranked Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Tuesday for a spot in the semifinals after Pavlyuchenkova upset No. 5 Sloane Stephens, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3. Simon Goffin, Pavlyuchenkova’s coach, said he knew Collins could rise to the occasion of an opponent like Kerber.","“She really likes these big stadiums, to play against the seeds, to be a bit of an underdog,” Goffin said of Collins. “She really likes this. She’s a tough challenger. She likes a big challenge, she likes a fight, so I’m not surprised.”",Collins did not moderate her hopes for the next match.,"“Hopefully, another amazing match of tennis for me,” she said in her on-court interview, one of several answers that drew startled gasps from audience members not used to such unapologetic self-assuredness.",Collins said she was animated by antagonism.,"“I just love competition,” she said. “Whether people are for me or against me, I’m not really fazed by it. I love it. Either way. I kind of like it more when people cheer against me sometimes because I want to get them back, prove them wrong.”","Despite Collins’s ability to build up her ranking, success at Grand Slams did not come until this tournament. Her first-round win over 14th-seeded Julia Görges was her first main draw victory at a Grand Slam event.","In her news conference, Collins pointed out that her draws in her three previous Grand Slam matches had been far from enviable, as she opened against a top-20 opponent each time.","“I did everything I could in those situations,” Collins said of her losses to Caroline Wozniacki, Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka. “Sometimes it just doesn’t go the way you want it to. Everybody gets their shot at the pie. Right now I’m certainly getting mine. I’m doing very well. I’m just kind of focused on that.”","In her on-court interview after the victory, Collins made it clear that she was confident of further slices of sweet Slam success.","“I may not have won a Grand Slam match before this,” she said. “But I’ve got to tell you: I think it’s going to keep happening.”"
"Reintroducing Frances Tiafoe, the New Mr. Upset of the Australian Open - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Sometimes Grand Slam breakthroughs, even for the most hyped and promising tennis players, come when least expected. Consider the case of Frances Tiafoe, the 21-year-old American hopeful who limped into this year’s Australian Open with little to suggest his first week would unfold in the stirring way that it has.","An electric talent who has been talked about since his midteens because of his potential and hardscrabble history, Tiafoe, ranked 39th, staggered through the end of last season. Then he went winless in a string of early January exhibition matches in Perth. Six days before this tournament began, he was outgunned at a warm-up tournament in Sydney by the Australian journeyman John Millman.","“Perth was terrible,” Tiafoe said. “Sydney was bad.”","Buzz? The kind of stirring expectations that surrounded the Federer slayer Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 14th-seeded Greek player, going into Melbourne?","Around Tiafoe, there was no buzz.","But all that changed over the first week of this tournament, a stretch that Tiafoe, a 6-foot-2 power hitter, capped on a hot Sunday afternoon with a round-of-16 win over Grigor Dimitrov, who was seeded No. 20. The score was 7-5, 7-6 (6), 6-7 (1), 7-5.","It was a third straight upset for a player who, entering this tournament, had never won a match at the Australian Open and had been in the draw only once, in 2018. Now, with a surprise win on his 21st birthday, Tiafoe has launched into the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time.","“It means the world,” said Tiafoe, known for his unvarnished candor, speaking to a packed crowd at Melbourne Arena after the match.","For all the hard work in a match that lasted nearly four hours, he next faces Rafael Nadal, the second seed, who has won the Australian Open once, in 2009. Nadal, of course, will be an overwhelming favorite. But Tiafoe will have a confidence he has never had before, and strong backing from fans.","Tiafoe, one of the few black male players in pro tennis, has become a crowd favorite in Melbourne, captivating crowds with his personality, flair-filled game and bare-chested celebrations that have followed each of his three big upsets. (He has made a habit of ripping his shirt off after a win, pounding his chest and his right biceps, and punching the air, a nod to moves made by LeBron James, one of his idols.)","“This is crazy man, this is crazy,” Tiafoe said a few hours after the match. His eyes sparkled. He looked as if he were in awe of his accomplishment. He recalled his past. Tiafoe’s parents fled a civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s and settled outside Washington. His father had been a custodian at a public tennis center in College Park, Md., and young Frances and his twin brother learned the game there.","In his early teens, Tiafoe promised his family that he would one day become a star tennis player, and take care of everyone.","“I obviously wasn’t a normal tennis story,” he said.","In the beginning of his career, he said, he had been playing for his family. Not long ago, he bought his mother a house and he is indeed providing his family with a comfortable life. “Now,” he said, “I’m trying to do it for me.”","Dimitrov, 27, is a tour stalwart known for his immense talent, long among the world’s top-20 men’s players, and the winner of eight tour titles. But from the start of this match, Tiafoe, who has won just a single title, gave as good as he got.","The match turned in the second set tiebreaker. Facing a trio of set points, Tiafoe responded as he has all week — first in his win against Kevin Anderson, one of the tournament favorites, and then over the 35th-ranked Italian veteran Andreas Seppi. He buckled down, kept his chin up and a spring in his step, and scorched a series of winners and error-inducing groundstrokes. Not long afterward, aided by a Dimitrov double fault, the set was his, and soon the match.","“In that tiebreak, as much as I was playing better and better, he just kept coming back with good answers,” said Dimitrov, whose own Grand Slam coming out came in 2014, when he lost in the Wimbledon semifinals to the eventual champion, Novak Djokovic.","On Sunday, after a match point in which a Dimitrov groundstroke fell into the net, Tiafoe bent over in the moment, hands on his knees, stunned. Who could blame him? He had struggled at the end of last year, losing matches a player of his talent is expected to win.","His traveling coach, Zack Evenden, explained that a turn came following the painful defeat two weeks ago to Millman, ranked No. 37, at the Sydney International.","“Millman wanted it more,” Evenden said. He recalled Tiafoe realizing that he could learn from the Australian journeyman, who is deeply admired on tour for his doggedness. “Talent is not enough to get you where you want to be. You’ve got to turn up for every single point. You have got to want it, and want it bad.”",Tiafoe now goes up against a player who has 17 Gand Slam titles and is perhaps the greatest competitor in tennis history.,"Nadal “is going to run me like crazy,” Tiafoe said after the match. Then he flashed the self-assurance that comes with a first major tournament breakthrough: “He better get ready.”"
The Osakas’ Brief Sister Act at the Miami Open - The New York Times,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — It’s a familiar sight to have a top player’s sister in the draw of the Miami Open, where this year Venus and Serena Williams are both competing for a 17th time.","But this tournament is the first time at a WTA-level event that top-ranked Naomi Osaka was joined in the singles main draw by her older sister, Mari.","Everyone else in women’s tennis is ranked below Naomi Osaka right now, including Mari, 22, who is ranked 338th, and normally plays lower-level events.","She received a wild card for this tournament and played her first WTA main draw match on Thursday against another wild card, 205th-ranked Whitney Osuigwe. Osaka acquitted herself well in a 6-2, 6-4 loss.","Naomi Osaka, who is 18 months younger than her sister, said that it was “really enjoyable” to have her Mari with her at a tournament, and that she hoped it would be an experience they shared far more in the future.","“For me it would be a dream,” Osaka said. “Because I don’t really talk to that many people, and she’s the nicer one in this relationship. It would definitely mean a lot.”","Though siblings like the Williamses or Marat Safin and Dinara Safina have risen to the peaks of the sport, siblings with far different career altitudes are more common.","Naomi Osaka’s opposite number in the men’s tour, top-ranked Novak Djokovic, had two younger brothers who struggled in the large shadow he cast. Despite receiving many wild cards, Marko Djokovic reached a career-high ranking of No. 571; Djordje Djokovic reached No. 1,463. Marko, 27, now coaches and competes only occasionally, while Djordje, 23, stopped competing in 2015.","Novak Djokovic, 31, said that his brothers’ decisions to step back from tennis had come as a relief to him.","“I’m glad they’ve decided themselves what they want to do, because in the end of the day it’s something that gives me satisfaction and peace, knowing that they made the decision, not myself or my parents or anybody else,” Djokovic said. “Because in this kind of circumstance, they feel obliged, or they feel pressure that they have to meet the expectations of the other brother or sister. Because if you’re part of the same sport, naturally, everyone will compare you to your other siblings. It’s not ideal, especially if your other sibling is the best in the world.”","Siblings of top players have often drafted off that familial fame to get started in their career, but the main draw wild card for Mari Osaka raised many eyebrows around the tournament, considering she was ranked more than 200 spots below the cut for the qualifying draw for this elite event. James Blake, the Miami Open tournament director, said the decision to double the number of Osakas in the draw had been an easy one.","“Obviously Naomi is someone that’s accomplished so much, and you want to encourage her sister as well,” Blake said. “You wonder if there’s a lot of talent and she hasn’t had the same opportunities. We know she’ll also be a draw. Naomi has so many fans; Mari is going to hopefully gain some of those fans by association.”","Blake, who reached a career-best of No. 4, had a brother, Thomas, who reached 264th — a parallel that he admitted tinted his view.","“He got some wild cards, definitely with the Blake name,” James Blake said. “He really appreciated them. Mari has thanked me, her parents have thanked me. They realize that this is a big opportunity for her.”","It is rarer for the younger sibling to make a splash on tour first. For most of their childhoods, Mari had dominated her younger sister in practice matches.","“Up until I was 15 she was 6-0-ing me, ridiculous,” Naomi said. “I don’t know what happened, maybe finally something clicked in my head, but for sure she was beating me. In the win-loss record, she’s up by like a million or something.”","Both entered the qualifying draw of the WTA tournament in Stanford, Calif., in 2014. Naomi, then 16, reached the main draw and then stunned the 2011 United States Open champion, Samantha Stosur, in the first round.","“It’s probably the second-best win of my life,” Osaka said after that victory, “the first being when I first beat my sister.”","As Naomi continued to soar upward, Mari’s trajectory stalled; her career-best ranking was 280th last May. Before Thursday she had not competed for more than a month because of a right shoulder injury. Her first match this season was a 6-0, 6-0 loss to 471st-ranked Katie Volynets, a far cry from the competitive level she showed on Thursday.","Mari Osaka said she was determined to play this tournament, knowing for the past six months that she would be awarded a wild card.","“It was just super exciting and new for me,” Mari said of the experience. “I’m super thankful that I actually got it.”","She smiled at the mention of her sister’s rise from 70th to first in the rankings since the beginning of last year. “I’m really proud of her,” Mari said.","Asked if she was able to focus on her own path or felt she had “big shoes to fill,” Mari said: “My own journey is separate, but of course I tend to compare a little bit, so it’s frustrating. But, you know, not much I can do about that.”","Osaka then abruptly broke into tears. She apologized, accepted a moderator’s offer to leave the room to regain her composure, and returned several minutes later.","When she returned, she was able to focus on the positives she took from the match.","“I played this match with no pain, which I haven’t done in such a long time,” she said. “It feels really good, like I can keep moving forward from here.”"
"Back From Tennis Purgatory, Lucas Pouille Defies Even His Own Expectations - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — At the start of this year’s Australian Open, the French tennis player Lucas Pouille was a man severely overlooked.","He had come to Melbourne, after all, on the heels of a 2018 season that dripped with disappointing losses, trying more than anything else to simply recapture a sense of joy on the court.","Expectations? Any that existed were extremely slim, Pouille said, as he looked back Wednesday on a tournament that now stands as the most thrilling of his seven-year career. Slim, from those on the outside looking in, he said, and “even from myself.”","But in the world of professional tennis, slim expectations can grow Grand Slam fat with remarkable speed. They certainly have this week for Pouille. On Wednesday afternoon at Melbourne Park, the Frenchman moved into his first Grand Slam semifinal with a sharp 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 victory over Milos Raonic of Canada, the lumbering former Wimbledon finalist with the massive serve who was seeded 16th.","Pouille, who had never won an Australian Open match before last week, now faces a nearly impossible task. The final is within his reach. But to get there he must beat Novak Djokovic, who currently rules men’s tennis with an iron grip.","Not long after Pouille and Raonic left Rod Laver Arena, Djokovic breezed into the final four, his quarterfinal match done in just 52 minutes when the eighth-seeded Kei Nishikori, of Japan, retired with a leg injury. Djokovic led by 6-1, 4-1 at the time, and had never been pushed. It was a gift. A match that short and stress free will help Djokovic, seeking his seventh Australian Open title, keep his body fresh at the stage in this tournament when he most needs it, especially since he had struggled through a bruising, four-set win over Daniil Medvedev earlier this week.","Pouille, 24 years old and seeded 28th, burst onto the scene in 2016, with quarterfinal showings at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, where he beat Nadal.","Last season, however, was tennis purgatory. True, his ranking did rise briefly to a career-high No. 10 in March. But he also failed to get past the third round of any of the major championships. He lost to players ranked outside the top 100. And as the year ended, he suffered through a string of early tournament defeats.","“I lost that joy being on the court,” he said, reflecting on last year after his quarterfinal match, which he won behind strong serving and a steady dose of returns that left the 6-5 Raonic off balance. “For some reason, I don’t know really know why it happened. I t did. You lose one match, two matches, three matches, then you lose confidence.”","Searching for a solution, he last month replaced his old coach with Amélie Mauresmo, the 39-year-old former pro who is a hero in France because of her pair of Grand Slam singles titles and because she is the last French player, male of female, to reach world No. 1.","Other top male players are coached by a woman, but those female coaches are relatives. Pouille’s arrangement with Mauresmo continues to be a story line, even though Mauresmo has coached men before, notably Britain’s Andy Murray, whom she guided to the Melbourne final in 2015.","“Men are coaching women, so why not the contrary?” Pouille said at his news conference. “It’s not about being a man or a woman, it’s about knowing tennis, about having the good state of mind.”","He summed up the ways that Mauresmo has helped him turn a corner. She creates “a cool atmosphere,” he explained. “We’re not too serious. We can laugh. We can make jokes. Once we go and hit the balls, we are really into it.”","In other words, balance.",And more: “I think she’s bringing a lot of confidence to my game.”,"Pouille will need every ounce of cool confidence, and likely the best tennis of his life, if he is to beat Djokovic on a packed center court stadium Friday.",Will Pouille be overlooked once again?,"Not a chance, said Djokovic. “I always thought he’s a great player,” the Serb told the assembled reporters in the wake of his own quarterfinal win.","Pouille “deserves to be definitely at the top 15, maybe top 10 of the world,” Djokovic added. “He’s got that quality and potential, no question about it. Here we go. It’s the semifinals. We both want to get to the finals. Hopefully we can both be fresh and fit and put on the great show.”"
"At the Miami Open, It’s Ashleigh Barty’s Turn for a Title - The New York Times","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion.","April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season.","“That’s amazing, isn’t it?” Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final.","But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke.","Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.","She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia’s 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup.","Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women’s season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami.","There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men’s doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas.","The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday’s victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.","“If you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,” Bob Bryan said.","Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova.","Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak.","But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women’s tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.","Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980.","Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors “we” and “team” more than “I” when discussing her rise.)","Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.","Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday’s final.","But it is Barty’s tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed.","Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova’s six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova’s 66 percent.","Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace.","Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women’s tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm.","“I have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,” Barty said. “It’s always about trying to neutralize what your opponent’s doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women’s tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women’s side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points.”","She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova’s flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).","It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential.","“I think I was an average cricketer, and I’m becoming a better tennis player,” she said. “It was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling.”","So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige.","Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well."
Novak Djokovic Falls to Veteran German at Indian Wells - The New York Times,"INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Back on the march as the best player in men’s tennis, Novak Djokovic stumbled in the desert sunlight on Tuesday on his favorite surface.","Djokovic flubbed some forehands and returns he normally makes in his third-round match at the BNP Paribas Open and cracked a racket in frustration. But he also ran into an inspired opponent in Philipp Kohlschreiber, a 35-year-old German who had lost seven straight matches to Djokovic but has long savored the memory of surprising Djokovic in the fourth round of the 2009 French Open.","Now, nearly a decade later, Kohlschreiber has another upset tale to tell.","No, Djokovic was not at his precise and predatory best, but Kohlschreiber still had to summon plenty of quality shot making and decision-making under pressure to finish him off, 6-4, 6-4.","“Of course you always need the No. 1 not playing his best tennis to beat him, but I’m very happy with my performance,” Kohlschreiber said.","It was a rough day all around for No. 1s. Naomi Osaka, the top player in the women’s game, was more soundly beaten. She lost, 6-3, 6-1, in the fourth round to Belinda Bencic in just 66 minutes. Osaka has won the last two Grand Slam singles titles, yet Tuesday’s result was no shock. Bencic, who just turned 22, is yet another great talent from Switzerland, land of Roger Federer and Martina Hingis. Bencic broke into the top 10 as a teenager in 2016 before left wrist surgery stopped her ascent.","She broke Osaka’s powerful serve five times in this brief encounter and proved more steady from the baseline, as well. She is now on a 11-match winning streak after winning the title in Dubai and has five victories over top 10 players in the last month.","“My injury just changed my perspective,” said Bencic, the No. 23 seed. “I learned so much from this time, and I’m really enjoying to be on the court.”",Hardcourts remain Djokovic’s happiest hunting ground. Ten of his 15 Grand Slam singles titles have come on the surface that suits his elastic athleticism best.,"He also has won five singles titles at Indian Wells, but after winning three straight times here in 2015, 2016 and 2017, he has run into early-round trouble.","Last year, in the midst of a deep funk and still recovering from elbow surgery, he made 58 unforced errors in an opening-match defeat to Taro Daniel, a Japanese qualifier. But this year, Djokovic arrived on an undeniable roll after sweeping to victory at the Australian Open, manhandling Rafael Nadal in the final.",Djokovic has won three straight Grand Slam singles titles and will hold all four for the second time if he can prevail at the French Open in June and complete another so-called “Djoker Slam.”,"He is still in the doubles here after reaching the semifinals with partner Fabio Fognini later on Tuesday, but only the tournaments ahead will show if Djokovic’s singles performance was a blip or a harbinger of more struggles.","“I had to get over it in an hour, because I played doubles,” Djokovic said. “I must admit I was thinking about it. When I hit a good return, I was wondering why this didn’t happen in singles. But it is, I guess, part of the world that we are, the world of tennis. It’s part of our world, and we just have to bounce back very quickly.”","Djokovic said competing in the doubles gave him “a chance to rectify the wrongs,” but that his singles performance would not affect him in the long run.","“I know what I’m capable of,” he said. “I know the quality of my tennis. It’s just one of those days. You just have to congratulate your opponent and move on.”","The timing was intriguing, coming after a week replete with tennis politicking. Djokovic, as president of the ATP Player Council, spent the days before the tournament in meetings and debate, and the ATP’s board of directors ultimately voted last Thursday not to renew the contract of Chris Kermode, the tour’s chairman and chief executive.","There has been plenty of pushback on the decision, with Nadal and Federer both pointing out that they were not consulted by Djokovic or council members in the run-up to the Kermode decision. Federer said he had reached out directly to Djokovic who had been unable to find time on his schedule for a discussion.","But then neither Nadal nor Federer are on the council at this stage, although both have served in the past. Federer, a former president, has acknowledged that the role can be draining, particularly in fraught times, and Djokovic spoke about that challenge on Sunday after defeating American Bjorn Fratangelo in his opening match.","“I care about the current generation and also the future generation and future of this sport,” Djokovic said. “I think that the sport is doing well, but it can also do better and better, you know, as we go along. And if I, with my status and with my position in the world of sport and tennis, can influence that positively, then why not? Yes, it takes away in energy and time, but I know I do it from the right place in my heart and with the right intent, and then I also receive a lot of energy for that.”","He has received some criticism, too, but appears intent on trying to push for structural reforms on the ATP Tour, which could include dividing Kermode’s role into two separate positions, or changing the size or composition of the board.",Success is far from guaranteed considering the internal tensions that exist in the ATP: an organization that is a long-running and often uneasy partnership between the players and those who own and operate the tournaments.,It would be all too easy to get distracted.,"But some rejected any such speculation on Tuesday and emphasized Kohlschreiber’s performance. Among them: Nick Kyrgios, the unpredictable and intermittently committed Australian who won a hardcourt title in Mexico last week in style but was beaten, 6-4, 6-4, by Kohlschreiber in the second round here.","“Something has to be wrong with him right?” Kyrgios tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Djokovic. “I lose to Kholi and get absolutely shredded ‘same old kyrgios’ how about the guy is just good? And he knows how to win matches? Hate this, why we always gotta kiss these guys when they lose?”","Kohlschreiber was unseeded here but not by much with a world ranking of 39. Quick and powerful, he has one of the prettiest one-handed backhands in the game yet does his most consistent damage with his forehand.","But in truth, he needed all his tennis tools to win on Tuesday after rain suspended play on Monday night after just one game. He also needed to put 71 percent of his first serves in play and save three of four break points against the game’s premier returner.","“I think I was not unhappy with the rain delay,” he said. “I think the warmer conditions suited my game more today. I was fresh. I had two good wins. So everything came together.”","Such moments have been hard to come by in the game’s biggest events during Kohlschreiber’s career, which has coincided with one of the greatest generations of stars in tennis history. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have 52 Grand Slam singles titles between them.",Kohlschreiber said he appreciated their greatness but also appreciated the benefits of minor as opposed to major celebrity.,"“I’m still able to walk on the street or go to, I don’t know, McDonald’s and there is just a few guys saying, ‘Oh, that’s maybe Kohlschreiber,’” he said. “I don’t know if Roger or Rafa can do that.”"
Will Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal Be Ready for the Clay-Court Season? - The New York Times,"The main clay-court season is officially underway, and this time around it is particularly unclear how the dust might settle.","If Rafael Nadal is truly healthy after aggravating a right knee injury three weeks ago — he has been training at home to prepare for the Monte Carlo Open — he remains the man to beat on the game’s grittiest surface. No one else has won 11 French Open singles titles, and the rational assumption is that no one else ever will.","But the women’s game is in a wondrous state of flux, with 14 different champions in the season’s first 14 tournaments. And none of them was named Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova or Simona Halep.","“It’s by far the most wide-open field as far as I can remember,” Chris Evert, the former No. 1 and a seven-time French Open champion, said in an interview Tuesday. “No one seems to have obvious momentum above the other. It’s not only the closeness in talent and skills. Attitudes, emotions and fitness and injuries enter into it as well. I have no clue.”","Serena Williams has not won a title since returning to the tour in March 2018 after giving birth to her daughter. She has played only three tournaments this season and has not finished any of them feeling healthy. She twisted an ankle while on the brink of victory in an Australian Open quarterfinal against Karolina Pliskova and lost a 5-1 third-set lead, unable to convert on four match points.","In Indian Wells, Calif., Williams retired in the third round against Garbiñe Muguruza, citing a viral illness. In Miami, she withdrew after winning her opening match, citing a left knee injury. Williams is 37, and her knees have long been a concern, restricting her training through the years. She does not plan to compete again until the Italian Open in Rome in mid-May, shortly before the French Open.","That will leave her short of matches against an increasingly deep and confident field, which is full of young, exciting talents with all-court games who have grown up dealing with big pace. Williams’s quest for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, which once looked like only a matter of time, is now a more complicated matter.","But discounting Williams is rarely a winning proposition. She has managed to play some sparkling tennis in 2019, striking the ball very cleanly in some of the early rounds in Australia and again in her victory over Victoria Azarenka in Indian Wells.","“A healthy Serena is a dangerous Serena; she hasn’t been healthy all year,” Evert said. “She still has an edge in power and experience.”","Williams also has the most impressive career record on clay of any active player: 170-34. Her career winning percentage of 83.3 puts her ahead of Sharapova, who is at 81.5 percent with plenty of doubt swirling about her form and her tennis future at age 31.","Happy off the court but vulnerable on it, she has not competed since January because of injuries and has not reached a tour final since winning the Tianjin Open in October 2017.","Halep has the best clay-court numbers over the last few seasons and leads the WTA Tour’s clay-court power rankings, which give more weight to recent results.","But even as she again closes in on being No. 1, Halep, 27, has hardly been dominant. Oui, she won last year’s French Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. But she has not won another clay-court title since Madrid in May 2017 and has not won a tournament on any surface since the Rogers Cup in Canada in August.","Without Darren Cahill as her coach this season, Halep has not looked like the same resolute and selectively aggressive force, although her run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last week was encouraging.","The biggest prizes in 2019 have gone to younger women, all under age 23.","Naomi Osaka, 21, won the year’s first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and remains No. 1 by a whisker. Belinda Bencic, 22, won the Premier 5 event in Dubai. Most surprisingly, Bianca Andreescu, 18, won the Premier Mandatory event in Indian Wells, and then Ashleigh Barty, 22, confirmed her steady rise by winning in Miami.","Andreescu and Barty have the skills to thrive on clay — their strong topspin forehands, quick feet and ability to hit sliced backhands, well-disguised drop shots and heavy first and second serves.",But the big-hitting Osaka has a losing record on clay (9-11) and likes to call herself “a hardcourt player.”,"She also has lost momentum since her surprising split with her coach, Sascha Bajin, after the Australian Open. She has hired Venus Williams’s former hitting partner, Jermaine Jenkins, a college star with a reassuring courtside demeanor. But for now, Osaka is only 3-3 since winning in Melbourne, with losses to Kristina Mladenovic in Dubai, to Bencic in Indian Wells and to the changeup artist Hsieh Su-wei in Miami.","Novak Djokovic, the men’s No. 1, also has the wind in his face after losing early in Indian Wells and Miami. But he has won three Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and it is difficult to disregard the memory of Djokovic having his way from the baseline against Nadal in the Australian Open final.","Nadal, 32, continues to battle his body. A recurrence of tendinitis in his right knee caused him to withdraw before his semifinal against Roger Federer in Indian Wells. At this stage, he knows too well the price of pushing through pain, although pain has been a constant. How much longer can he do it?","“Who knows? Perhaps two or three years more,” Toni Nadal, his uncle and former coach, said at a recent appearance in Majorca. “What I say is that Rafael is not a person who plays tennis. He is an injured person who plays tennis, and that is very difficult.”","Nadal is back training hard in Majorca on a surface that is more forgiving to his joints than hardcourts. He is on schedule to defend his title in Monte Carlo this month. Djokovic and No. 5 Dominic Thiem, Nadal’s two most obvious rivals for the biggest men’s clay-court titles, are expected to challenge him there. So is third-ranked Alexander Zverev, who has a fine clay-court record and the talent to win multiple majors but has been slumping.","Federer, back on a roll at age 37 after winning in Miami and intent on returning to clay after a three-year break, plans to come back in Madrid in early May after training in Switzerland.","“I still think Rafa is in a great place on clay,” said David Macpherson, the coach of John Isner, the top-ranked American, who may miss much of the clay-court season with a stress fracture in his foot. “The only one who has shown the ability to break up Rafa’s game at times is Novak, with his ability to smother that topspin forehand early with his pure two-handed backhand and negate Rafa’s strengths on clay. So that’s always a fascinating matchup.”","But based on all the plot twists and ankle twists in 2019 so far, there are no guarantees that it will be the decisive matchup.",Time to watch the dust try to settle.
"At 40, Ivo Karlovic Remains a Towering and Punishing Force - The New York Times","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — It was 2011. Ivo Karlovic was already an ATP Tour veteran with graying temples, and his close friend and former coach Tarik Benhabiles was talking about Karlovic’s serve, and his future.","“He has a huge weapon,” Benhabiles told me. “He can play until he’s 40 years old, no problem.”","Kudos to Benhabiles, who once helped Andy Roddick become a force, for knowing his tennis. But, above all, kudos to Karlovic, the 6-foot-11 Croatian, for finding a way to fight and serve through everything life has thrown at him.","It has hardly been “no problem,” but Karlovic turned 40 on Feb. 28, and he is definitely still playing.","He has won three rounds at the BNP Paribas Open this year and is now the oldest man to win a singles match at a Masters 1000 event. On Wednesday, with plenty of gray in his beard now as well as in his temples, Karlovic will deploy his fearsome weapon against Dominic Thiem, the No. 7 seed, for a place in the quarterfinals.","At 25, Thiem is 15 years younger than Karlovic — but then just about everybody on tour is younger than Karlovic, including some of his former rivals who are now coaches.","“He’s older than me!” said Ivan Ljubicic, the 39-year-old co-coach of Roger Federer, who remains the most prominent graybeard in men’s tennis but is still Karlovic’s junior at 37.","Karlovic has remained a factor by overcoming a major Achilles’ tendon injury in 2010 and encephalitis in 2013, which caused debilitating headaches and left him temporarily without feeling in his right arm.","He has remained a force by focusing on fitness and dropping weight to take the pressure off his knees and other joints. He is down to 225 pounds, from 245 in 2011.","On court, Karlovic has learned to maximize his strengths and accept his weaknesses. He will never have a drive backhand, but his one-handed slice is crisp enough. And though his lateral mobility remains limited compared to his competitors, his forehand is huge and his serve-and-volley style is even more unusual and disorienting in this baseline-focused era.","In truth, his style is often serve-and-no-volley. He has slammed an ATP record 13,235 aces. Along the way, he has definitively proven, like it or not, that there is a place in a movement-based game for players of towering height like the 6-10 John Isner, the 33-year-old American star, and the 6-11 Reilly Opelka, a 21-year-old from the U.S. who is hitting aces at a rapid clip of his own.","“If you look at any sport, everywhere there are taller guys, so I know that is the future in tennis,” Karlovic said, as he has said for years.","Ljubicic, who had a huge serve of his own and will turn 40 this month, grew up playing junior tournaments with Karlovic in Croatia and elsewhere. It was a time of war in the former Yugoslavia, and tennis was often the least of the youngsters’ concerns.","Fearing for their lives, Ljubicic’s family fled Bosnia and ended up briefly in a refugee camp in Croatia. Ljubicic eventually ended up honing his game in an Italian tennis club and reaching No. 3 in the world in 2006 before retiring in 2012.","Karlovic stayed in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. He was the son of well-educated professionals: his father a meteorologist; his mother an agronomist.","“In Zagreb, there were not a lot of airstrikes, but I spent a lot of time in the bomb shelters,” Karlovic said of his early teens. “It was always airstrike warnings.”","Funds were short, and so was quality coaching and court time. Karlovic had already decided he preferred tennis to basketball despite attempts to recruit him. He would wait until the evening when the tennis courts in Zagreb were empty and then use the balls he could find and hit serves on his own, sometimes after dark.","“It was the only way I could practice,” he said. “I would like people to know that my serve is not only that good because of my height. I worked on it a lot.”","He did not find a regular coach until his early 20s, and despite his imposing presence he managed to fly far below the radar until the first round of Wimbledon in 2003, where, as an all-but-unknown qualifier in an age before social media, he upset the defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in four sets on Centre Court.","“It was not easy: I was looking around at all these huge courts I never had a chance to play on before,” Karlovic said. “I lost the first set 6-1, but after that I just kind of calmed down and started playing my game, and then after the match, it was not easy because everybody wanted to know, who am I?”","What made it harder was the pronounced stammer that Karlovic has had since boyhood, which made public speaking excruciating.","“I was just thinking to myself, this is what you have to do if you want to become a good player,” he said of post-match news conferences. “You’re going to have to do it.”","Nearly 16 years later, the stammer is much less pronounced, and Karlovic has become not only an excellent player but an enduring one. He peaked in the rankings at No. 14 in 2008 but was still in the top 20 last year before injuries contributed to him dropping to No. 138 in September.","Instead of calling it a career, Karlovic chose to head back to tennis’s minor leagues with the goal of making the main draw of the Australian Open. If he didn’t achieve that goal, he would retire. He played in a series of ATP Challenger events in the final months of 2018, winning one in Calgary.","Australia beckoned. But Karlovic, now based in Plantation, Fla., said one of the biggest challenges has been leaving his family behind. He and his wife, Alsi, have two children: a 7-year-old daughter, Jada, and an 18-month-old son, Noah.","“I had to leave on Christmas Day to get to a tournament in India,” he said. “So everybody was home. We had friends over, family, and then after lunch I was on the way to the airport. It was really difficult. My kids were crying and stuff, so it wasn’t easy, but on the other hand, I am doing this also because of them, you know? So they don’t have it as hard as I had it. So maybe that evens out the pain for me.”",He wanted Jada to have a memory of him as a professional tennis player.,"“But now I also have a little one who is one-and-a-half years old,” said Karlovic, now ranked No. 89. “So I guess for him to remember me I’m going to have to play at least another eight more years.”",Presumably not even Benhabiles is ready to predict that.
"At the Miami Open, Latin American Players Feel at Home - The New York Times","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — This year’s Miami Open is about 20 miles north of its previous home on Key Biscayne, but the tournament’s cultural epicenter is unmoved. It’s still somewhere thousands of miles to the south.","Because there is no tournament of its caliber in Mexico, the Caribbean, or Central and South America, the Miami Open has developed into the de facto Latin American Slam, drawing fans from the region and its diasporas, transforming this Florida fixture into a virtual homecoming for Latino players.","“It’s really nice to have the support,” said Leonardo Mayer, an Argentine. “It’s almost like playing in Buenos Aires.”","The top South American player, Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, missed this year’s tournament because of a knee injury, but fans had to change only one letter in their customary cheer for him in order to root for his compatriot Federico Delbonis, who took a set off top-ranked Novak Djokovic on Sunday. Instead of “Olé, olé, olé, olé! Delpo, Delpo!” they chanted, “Delbo, Delbo!”","Even away from the court, the Miami area’s large Latino population affects the experience of playing in the tournament. Delbonis said he appreciated being able to buy yerba mate leaves in Miami to make his favorite beverage; for most events, he has to travel with his own supply.","“Every time I come here I feel like I want to be here, I want to live here,” he said. “When I got to the court today, I heard a lot of Argentinians speaking Spanish, cheering in Spanish, and you feel that energy they give you. They give you confidence, and you feel it inside. It’s good for your game to be more happy on court.”","Monica Puig, who in 2016 won Puerto Rico’s first Olympic gold medal, had vocal support from many Puerto Rican fans in her first-round match on Wednesday, when she lost to Wang Xiyu. She said regretted not being able to play more matches throughout the season in front of that crowd, which included her father.","“Having that Latin American feel here, just buzzing all over the place, it’s really special,” said Puig, the only Latin American woman ranked in the top 100 in singles.","Even fans from Latin American countries that are not represented among the players make their presence felt. After Fabio Fognini of Italy defeated Guido Andreozzi of Argentina on Friday, a woman unfurled a large Paraguayan flag.","Latin American reporters travel to the Miami Open in droves, with 24 representatives of Argentine news media leading this year’s international contingent, according to the tournament.","Though Latin American fans initially embraced the tournament organically, the event has begun marketing to them directly, including digital advertising in South America in both Spanish and Portuguese, as well as on Spanish-language websites in South Florida. (While Latin food and music can be found on the grounds, all the signs at the Miami Open are in English.)","Players from the United States have to adjust to this rare home tournament where the crowds may not tip in their favor. Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay recalled being stunned in 2011 when fans chanted his country’s name as he upset Andy Roddick, the defending champion and American star, on the stadium court of Key Biscayne.","In one of the last matches played at the old venue in 2018, the American John Isner, the eventual champion, had little support when he met del Potro in the semifinals.","“The fans were great, but it was not 50-50,” Isner said, smiling. “There were a lot of Argentinian flags, that country loves their sport, loves their soccer and their tennis. To see all the flags in the crowd, it was a very, very cool atmosphere.”",Many other non-Latin American players similarly relish the passionate crowds.,"“I’ve always played the best in countries and in places where I felt that energy,” Alexander Zverev of Germany said. “In Rome I always felt great. Italians are very energetic, powerful people. Madrid, Mexico, Miami: It’s always those kind of places I’ve played well in. For me, I enjoy when the crowd is loud, energetic, and it’s nice when this happens.”",Dominic Thiem of Austria has won four of his 12 career titles in Latin America — two in Argentina and one each in Mexico and Brazil.,"“The energy in these countries and from these people is nice,” Thiem said. “It feels like they are always in a good mood. They are happy to live, I feel. It’s sometimes different in Europe — maybe it’s the weather, I don’t know.”","James Blake, a former player from the United States who is now the tournament director of the Miami Open, said he had savored his two matches against Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil at the tournament, where American supporters could not match the Brazilians’ boisterousness.","“Those are a lot of fun, because you’re on the edge of your seat,” Blake said. “Every big point, every shot, is exacerbated by the fact that the crowd’s going crazy, and you’re angry at yourself because their crowd is going crazy.”",Players are not always comfortable with the din.,"“There are some players who don’t love it,” Blake said, “and they’ve voiced that to me, plenty.”","After she lost to Puig last year, Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark threatened to boycott the tournament, saying her supporters felt threatened by people in the profusely pro-Puig crowd.","Wozniacki did return this year and said she had not discussed the incident with tournament organizers since. Last week she focused on the positives of the partisanship — like hearing the chants for Delbonis as she played on a nearby court, and being able to quell the noise.","“I could hear it was like a soccer-like atmosphere,” Wozniacki said. “It’s cool. It’s obviously more fun when they cheer for you. At the same time it’s also fun to quiet the fans. It’s fun when all of a sudden it goes dead quiet.”","Jérémy Chardy enjoyed silencing the cacophony of Chileans who were raucously supporting his opponent, Nicolàs Jarry, in their first-round match. After he won, he blew kisses toward the Chilean contingent.","“You always know when you play a South American here it will be difficult,” Chardy said. “The crowd was difficult all the match, and I didn’t say a word. Just at the end when I won, I wanted to send them kisses, and they replied with some fingers.”","Chardy said he appreciated the animated crowd, despite the animus.","“Even if it was not always respectful,” he said, “I prefer when there’s atmosphere to no atmosphere.”"
"Roger Federer Is the Defending Australian Open Champion, but Not the Favorite - The New York Times","PERTH, Australia — Amélie Mauresmo won her two Grand Slam singles titles in 2006 and retired three years later. She had no idea that Roger Federer, the man who won Grand Slam singles titles on those same weekends as her in 2006, would still be on top of his sport more than a decade later.","“I don’t know how he does it,” Mauresmo said. “What it puts on your body is huge. The training, the matches, the travel, the jet lag, anything.”","Mauresmo and Federer won the Australian Open and Wimbledon singles titles in 2006. Two years older than Federer, Mauresmo, 39, retired from the sport in 2009, at 30, and is at the Australian Open as coach of the French player Lucas Pouille.",Federer is at the Australian Open as the two-time defending champion. His bid for a 21st Grand Slam singles championship begins Monday in Melbourne.,"“Winning back-to-back Australian Opens like this, in my mid-30s, it’s one of my favorite things I will look back on in my career,” he said. “I didn’t think it was going to happen, and I had such a great time here in Australia the last couple of years and always enjoyed playing here.”","Federer acknowledges his age readily, quipping at the Hopman Cup recently that his 20-year-old opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, “could be my son.” And he marvels at his own ability to run up the score in the record books — 99 titles and counting — at an age when many would count him out.","But after an auspicious start to last season, when he won his first 17 matches, Federer seemed to trail off. After winning the title in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in February and briefly reclaiming the No. 1 ranking, Federer went without another tournament championship until October. After skipping the clay-court season for the second year in a row, he lost in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon after holding a match point against Kevin Anderson, and in the fourth round of the United States Open to John Millman.",Federer played down the doomsday talk that accompanied his stagnation in the second half of the year.,"“I wasn’t too disappointed,” he said. “I was more surprised to hear that there was sort of concern, or people were saying, ‘What a bad second half to the year.’ ”","Federer conceded disappointing finishes at the Grand Slam events but thought he otherwise played well, including a loss in a third-set tiebreaker to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals of the Paris Masters in November.",He said what he needed to do better this year “is really play well when it really comes down to the crunch.”,"Federer said he trusted his own evaluations of his play as well as input from his coaches, Ivan Ljubicic and Severin Lüthi.","“I can analyze — with my age, very well — my own matches and my own feelings,” he said. “I have two great coaches, two of the best in the game, who give me their fair assessment, and I have a fitness coach who tells me if I’m moving good or not. They’re all open and honest towards me. I don’t want any sugarcoating; I want it real, and straight. That’s it. I know, always, where I’m at.","“It’s very clear in my team where I stand. And from that standpoint, I’m happy where I am right now. I’m in a great position.”",Mauresmo longs to learn more about what Federer does in his off-seasons.,"“I hope one day he will explain to everyone everything,” she said. “The little details, everything that he’s put together to be able to play this well at his age, to move this well.”","Federer is not exactly clandestine about his routines. He prefers, for example, to do his off-season movement drills on a tennis court, rather than indoors as many players do, to better simulate the footing and friction of match conditions.","“I do a bit of weights, too,” he said, grinning and gesturing toward his lithe frame. “I know we don’t see it, but I do.”","Federer started his season auspiciously, winning all eight sets he played at the Hopman Cup last week, never dropping serve in any of the matches.","But he considers the top-ranked Djokovic the clear favorite at the Australian Open. Djokovic, a six-time champion in Melbourne, has won the last two Grand Slam tournaments.","“We know who the usual are,” said Federer, who is seeded third, “and I’m part of that bunch.”","The longevity of that oligarchy, which also includes Rafael Nadal, has blocked several younger players from breaking through on tennis’s biggest stages. No player currently younger than 30 has won even a set in a Grand Slam final.","“We’re all tired of you guys already, but what can we do?” fourth-ranked Alexander Zverev, 21, said during the trophy ceremony of the Hopman Cup on Saturday, when he lost to Federer in singles and mixed doubles.","“Especially you,” he added, turning around and looking at Federer, who laughed. “I mean, you’re 30-whatever! Why? Just, why? Let us have one.”"
"During the Lunar Eclipse, Something Slammed Into the Moon - The New York Times","On Sunday and Monday, those in the Western Hemisphere with clear skies were fortunate enough to see the last total lunar eclipse of the decade. As the moon took on a distinctly redder shade just before midnight Eastern Time, livestreams of the phenomenon showed a flash of light suddenly and briefly emanating from the lunar surface.","Anthony Cook, an astronomical observer at Los Angeles’ Griffith Observatory which streamed the eclipse, thought it could have just been the camera’s random electronic noise. Then astronomers and citizen scientists started to share their detection of the flash on Reddit and Twitter.",The only explanation was that something slammed into the lunar surface and obliterated itself.,[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.],"The moon is a multi-billion-year-old library of impact events, with fresh collisions still taking place frequently today. Capturing a lunar impact on video is rare enough, but this event — a collision during a total lunar eclipse — may be a first.","“I have not heard of anyone seeing an impact like this during a lunar eclipse before,” said Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum in London.","Dr. Russell said that flashes can only be seen from Earth when the lunar surface is in shadow, which is normally just a few days before and after the new moon. A luminous full moon is anathema to such detections, but a total lunar eclipse, painting our pale celestial companion in darkness, changed that.","Justin Cowart, a graduate student in geosciences at Stony Brook University in New York who spotted the flash, managed to narrow down the impact location. Using images from an amateur astronomer, Christian Fröschlin, Mr. Cowart determined that the flash took place somewhere in the lunar highlands, south of Byrgius crater.","NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which studies the moon’s surface, may soon spot the fresh crater. But the impact flash itself can be used to roughly estimate the size of the object that crashed on the moon, and its momentum. Based on NASA and European Space Agency databases of impact flashes, Mr. Cowart guesses that “it was probably somewhere between the size of an acorn and tennis ball.”","Detection data from the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System, or MIDAS, found that the space rock was a pipsqueak of a meteoroid, only weighing something like 22 pounds, and measuring no more than 12 inches across.","The provenance of the meteoroid remains an open question. According to Jose Maria Madiedo, an astrophysicist at the University of Huelva in Spain who is a co-director of the MIDAS system, most objects that hit Earth come from comets and not asteroids, and the same applies to the moon","With that in mind, he said, “the most likely situation is that the impactor was a rock from a comet.” ","Considering its tiny dimensions, it must have been moving at an incredible speed to create a flash of light visible from Earth. Indeed, Dr. Madiedo said that the impact velocity would be in the range of 38,000 miles per hour. That is just over twice the speed that NASA’s old space shuttle had to move after launch to achieve orbit of Earth.","A total lunar eclipse is always something to marvel at, but one being gate-crashed by a hypersonic cometary shard is something else entirely."
Andy Murray Gave His All. Which Is Why This Ending Hurts. - The New York Times,Andy Murray is not the youngest of the tennis supergroup known as the Big Four. Novak Djokovic was born a week later than Murray was.,"But it is still quite an unpleasant surprise to realize that Murray, 31, very likely will be the first of the remarkable quartet to retire.",Roger Federer is somehow still gliding at 37. Rafael Nadal is somehow still persevering at 32.,"But Murray has been in too much pain for too long with no relief in view, and on Friday in Melbourne, Australia, all of those who have followed his career from up close or a great distance could share some of his pain, too.",It was not what he said. It was what he couldn’t say.,"Murray, like all tennis stars of his stature, has spent as much time in news conferences as most of us have spent at the coffee shop. They are an artificial construct that has become a natural habitat for Murray, a droll, strong-minded Scotsman with the voice that sounds like a low-flying drone — a voice he once called “my least favorite thing about me.”","But as he sat down behind the table on Friday, his cap pulled low and his lips pursed, reporters placed digital recorders on the table in front him to capture the words. There was soon nothing to capture.","Asked how he and his ailing hip were feeling, he answered, “Yeah, not, not great.”","He then sighed, averted his glance, dropped his chin, touched the bill of his cap and his face, fought for composure and was unable to utter another word for nearly a minute before finally grabbing his credential off the desk and leaving the room.","Though he soon returned, nothing he explained then was nearly as eloquent as those 45 seconds of silence.","What mattered most was all in there: the sensitivity, the humanity, the competitive fire reduced to anguish at not being able to solve his hip problem despite all the medical expertise, financial resources and iron will at his disposal.","Murray plans to play on, hopefully until Wimbledon this summer, although there are no guarantees. He acknowledged that this Australian Open, which begins Monday, could be the finish line, and surely the poignancy of making such an announcement in Melbourne was not lost on him.",[Update: Andy Murray loses in his first-round match at the Australian Open.],"Sir Andrew Barron Murray has had many triumphs in his 31 years: back-to-back Olympic gold medals and three Grand Slam titles, none more resonant than his winning Wimbledon in 2013 to end a 77-year drought for British men in singles. Many other worthies, including Bunny Austin and Tim Henman, had embarked on the same quest and faltered.",But Australia is where Murray has had to face his own tennis limitations.,"He broke down in tears during the awards ceremony after losing the final to Federer in 2010, but though he has, in his own words, “kept it together” since then in Melbourne, 2010 was only the beginning of the disappointment. He lost the final again in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016.","No other man has gone 0-5 in singles finals at the same major tournament, and he shares the blame with Djokovic, his one-time doubles partner, who has beaten Murray in the last four of those finals.","So close in age and skill sets, they first played as 13-year-olds at Les Petits As junior tournament in France. Murray won in a hurry, but they have played 36 times as professionals, more than enough to make it clear that Djokovic is the greater player.","He leads their series by 25-11 and has 14 Grand Slam singles titles (and counting). For many, the Big Four has become the Big Three. And doesn’t Stan Wawrinka have — like Murray — three major titles of his own?","Such arguments have merit: Federer and Nadal also have winning records against Murray, and there is no doubt now that in the final analysis of this golden tennis era, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic will be the central figures and the statistical leaders.","But Murray earned his place in tennis’s great modern foursome, with his week-to-week consistency, his resilience, his all-surface brilliance and his ability to excel at Wimbledon with the equivalent of the Centre Court roof on his shoulders.","“Never motivated by money, only by his rivals; he didn’t need people’s respect, but he earned it,” Mark Petchey, Murray’s former coach, said in the wake of Murray’s announcement.","Murray might not have been here at all. He and his older brother, Jamie, were young students at Dunblane Primary School in their Scottish town in 1996 when a local resident entered the grounds and murdered 16 of their schoolmates and a teacher before shooting himself.","The Murray brothers survived, though not without invisible scars, and they both grew up to become No. 1 in the world: Andy in singles, Jamie in doubles.","That is a tribute to their childhood sibling rivalry, their talent and their work ethic, and also to their formidable tennis mother, Judy, a former Scottish professional player who has been a driving force with her intuition, her ambition, her sharp wit and her informed passion for the game.","Jamie, 32 and still in the top 10 in doubles, plans to play beyond 2019. Andy, at this stage, does not.","“He was a kaleidoscope of talent, of emotion, of movement, spirit and authenticity,” said Petchey, a former British player who introduced Murray to Kim Sears, who would become Murray’s wife. “He was a winner, but he became a champion. A champion not just on the court but a champion of causes off it. He leaves as he arrived. Tennis never changed him, but he changed tennis.”","Murray, in part (but only in part) because of his mother’s impact on his career, has been the rare men’s No. 1 to speak out frequently in support of gender equality and women’s tennis, whose results he actually seems to follow. He has also walked the walk, hiring a woman as a coach: Amélie Mauresmo.","That has endeared him to a wider audience and only underscored the gulf between on-court Murray and off-court Murray. Under pressure and between the lines, he has often been far from endearing: barking at his entourage, using language better suited to the Glasgow docks, and muttering, muttering, muttering as he chased perfection in a sport that refused to cooperate.","Watching him at work, it all has often seemed more a burden than a pleasure. His service motion resembles heavy lifting, and long before his hip problems became career threatening, his walk between points looked closer to a hobble.","But that was before he sensed an opportunity and sprang into action: a short ball he could pounce on for a winner, a wide ball he could chase down that hardly anyone else in the game could have reached.","Murray in his prime was above all a supreme athlete, possessed of quickness, coordination, feathery touch and selective striking power.","As recently as 2016, he had his finest season, winning nine titles and reaching No. 1 for the first time. It still seems premature to believe that he is just about done. After all, retirement in tennis has long been a euphemism for a sabbatical, and one of Murray’s peers who has dealt with pain offered words of encouragement on Friday.","“Please don’t stop trying,” Juan Martín del Potro wrote on Twitter. “Keep fighting. I can imagine your pain and sadness. I hope you can overcome this. You deserve to retire on your own terms, whenever that happens.”","Del Potro speaks from experience; multiple wrist operations nearly snuffed out his career. His is a voice to be heeded. But unfortunately so is Murray’s, especially when the emotions are so powerful that the words just won’t come."
"Belinda Bencic Is Bouncing Back, Forcefully - The New York Times","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Belinda Bencic is making a tricky game look easy at the moment, redirecting her big-swinging opponents’ best shots into the corners, conjuring defensive lobs and flicking reflex returns from inside the baseline.","“I’m trying not to think who is on the other side of the court,” she said.","But there is no ignoring the quality of her recent tennis victims. From Dubai to Indian Wells, Bencic has been taking on the best in the women’s game and emerging again and again with a broad smile on her face.","On Thursday, she ran her winning streak to 12 matches by defeating her sixth top-10 opponent in less than a month. On Tuesday she had routed Naomi Osaka, the new world No. 1, in little more than an hour at the BNP Paribas Open, but in Thursday’s quarterfinal, Bencic met with a great deal more resistance from No. 5 seed Karolina Pliskova before prevailing, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, in 2 hours 16 minutes.","It was a match of fluctuating quality but no shortage of bravura shotmaking in the breeze, Pliskova’s flat power against Bencic’s fast-twitch counterpunching.","“I think Belinda’s the best in the world at redirecting power, I really do,” said Mary Joe Fernandez, the ESPN analyst and a former champion at Indian Wells.","That is quite a statement, considering that women’s tennis is full of talented counterpunchers, including the reigning French Open champion, Simona Halep, and the reigning Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, who will face Bencic in the semifinals after defeating Venus Williams, 7-6 (3), 6-3, on Thursday.","But Bencic, a Swiss extrovert who turned 22 on Sunday and is returning to the fore after injury, has long been considered one of the game’s most sparkling talents. She was taught to see the game in full by her father, Ivan, and also by Melanie Molitor, the mother and coach of Martina Hingis, the Swiss wunderkind who rose to No. 1 by treating a tennis court like a chessboard.","Switzerland’s tennis star-in-chief, Roger Federer, has played a supportive role in Bencic’s career of late, partnering with her in the Hopman Cup team event and sending encouraging messages.","“She’s worked a lot for this moment, and the big reward is coming now,” Federer said. “I got to know her at the Hopman Cup and tried to give her as much advice as I could. She’s got a different game and is in a different stage of her career. Hopefully I helped. But the credit is hers and her team’s.”","When Ivan Bencic first became interested in having his daughter play the game, Federer had not yet broken through to the elite level. Hingis was the Swiss player he watched and admired, and their families had more in common than an attraction to tennis. Molitor and Hingis had immigrated to Switzerland from the Slovakian side of the former Czechoslovakia. So had Ivan Bencic, whose family fled the country in 1968 after the Soviet invasion.","Ivan Bencic telephoned Molitor when Belinda was 5 years old and asked her to take a look at his daughter’s nascent game. Molitor was impressed enough to offer to help from time to time. It became a much more profound connection after Molitor started her own academy, and Hingis later added her own counsel to the mix.","Though Bencic has more natural power and a more potent serve than her mentor did in her prime, she shares the ability to read tennis tea leaves even in the midst of a fast-paced rally.","“She was helping me a lot,” Bencic said of Hingis, who retired in October 2017 as the world’s No. 1 doubles player.","At that stage, Bencic was still coming back from an operation on her left wrist. Though she is right handed, the pain had kept her from hitting her two-handed backhand effectively.","She had appeared to be on a fast train to the top after defeating Caroline Wozniacki, Ana Ivanovic, Serena Williams and Halep in 2015 at age 18, on her way to the Rogers Cup title in Toronto and to later reaching the top 10.","But her wrist injury changed that career arc, causing her to miss five months in 2017 and fall outside the top 300. She returned at low-level professional tournaments in Europe rather than use a protected ranking and return at the highest level.","Less than two years later, that looks like the right move. There have been some stumbles, but she has found her footing and is guaranteed to re-enter the top 20 on Monday.","“I played those small events and built my confidence back up with my ranking,” she said of 2017. “Because with the wrist, you never know if it’s going to be good or going to hold. You hear so many stories of someone needing a second wrist surgery and then another one, and it wasn’t great. So definitely the first tournaments, it’s always a test to see if you can keep up. I didn’t want to play a big tournament with all the people right away and have the comeback in the public eye. I definitely needed matches and confidence.”","She is getting both in large quantities now. She beat four top-10 players on her way to the title in Dubai last month: Aryna Sabalenka, Halep, Elina Svitolina and Petra Kvitova. She has now beaten Osaka and Pliskova in Indian Wells and, based on level of play, can be considered the favorite for the title.","This is a fascinating, power-shifting phase in women’s tennis. Osaka, 21, has been the player of the moment for the last six months, winning the singles titles at the 2018 United States Open and this year’s Australian Open.","But fresh threats to the new and fragile order continue to surface. Bianca Andreescu, an 18-year-old Canadian wild card, has reached the semifinals here and has a 25-3 record in tour-level matches this year.","Bencic is not emerging, of course. She is re-emerging, and though it could not have been easy to see players near her age — such as Osaka and Jelena Ostapenko, the surprise 2017 French Open champion — claim the biggest trophies, Bencic said that envy was not a driving force.","“It’s great that we have so many great players in our age group,” she said. “But it’s not like I’m thinking, ‘Ah, I’m much better than her, and she’s winning Grand Slams, and I’m not.’ I definitely don’t have this mind-set, because I feel like that person who wins a Grand Slam definitely deserves it. They must be doing something right. It’s only inspiring for me.”","To get her game right this year, Bencic decided to have her father return as her full-time coach for the first time since 2016.","“It’s definitely not a coincidence I’m playing the way I’m playing now,” she said.","She wanted her freedom in 2016, but believes that they are both on the same wavelength now. And when she was getting edgy against Halep in Dubai, she called her father onto the court for a coaching visit, and he told her to take a moment, look around and appreciate how far she had come.","Her fitness has also improved significantly, something she attributes to maturity and to her Slovakian fitness coach, Martin Hromkovic, a former soccer player who is also her boyfriend.","“For me, it works right now very well,” she said. “When we are doing the work, Martin is my coach, and I’m respecting that. But as well I am feeling the support so much, like he’s doing everything he can for me and sacrificing really a lot. So I’m super happy to have him by my side.”"

Ad Showing Naomi Osaka With Light Skin Prompts Backlash and an Apology - The New York Times,"Naomi Osaka, the half-Haitian, half-Japanese tennis champion, is the star of a new Japanese anime-style advertisement.","The problem? The cartoon Ms. Osaka bears little resemblance to her real, biracial self.","Her skin was unmistakably lightened, and her hair style changed — a depiction that has prompted criticism in Japan, where she has challenged a longstanding sense of cultural and racial homogeneity.","The ad — unveiled this month by Nissin, one of the world’s largest instant-noodle brands — features Ms. Osaka and Kei Nishikori, Japan’s top-ranked male tennis player, in a cartoon drawn by a team commissioned by Nissin. The cartoon was based on the work of Takeshi Konomi, a well-known manga artist whose series “The Prince of Tennis” is popular in Japan.","Ms. Osaka, who faces Elina Svitolina in an Australian Open quarterfinal match on Wednesday, and Mr. Konomi have not publicly commented on the reactions to the ad.",But a Nissin spokesman apologized in an email on Tuesday for “the confusion and discomfort.”,"The spokesman, Daisuke Okabayashi, said that the characters had been developed in line with Mr. Konomi’s anime series and that the company had communicated with Ms. Osaka’s representatives.","“There is no intention of whitewashing,” he said. “We accept that we are not sensitive enough and will pay more attention to diversity issue in the future.”","After the ad was first published online, people on social media, including many fans of Ms. Osaka’s, said they were deeply disappointed.","Baye McNeil, an author who has lived in Japan for 15 years, said he didn’t understand why the ad would “erase her black features and project this image of pretty much the prototypical anime girl-next-door character.”","Ms. Osaka’s rise into a beloved national figure has been particularly exciting for biracial people in Japan, known as hafus, who have long battled for acceptance, he said.","“Making her look white just tells these people that what they are isn’t good enough,” Mr. McNeil said.","Ms. Osaka was born in Japan to a Haitian-American father and a Japanese mother, and moved to the United States when she was 3. Although she isn’t fluent in Japanese, often responding to questions from Japanese reporters in English, she has tweeted about her love of manga and Japanese movies.","Ranked fourth in the world at just 21, she’s already among Japan’s most accomplished tennis players ever. She became the first Japanese-born tennis player to win a Grand Slam singles championship in September when she defeated Serena Williams in the U.S. Open, a victory that supercharged her celebrity ascent.","That win prompted a cartoon in an Australian newspaper that was criticized for its depiction of Ms. Williams, which many saw as a racist caricature. While most of the condemnation focused on how the Australian cartoonist drew Ms. Williams, critics also noted that Ms. Osaka was depicted with blond hair and light skin.","Black characters aren’t frequently found in anime, but artists in the medium have successfully depicted their skin tones before.","“When there is a black character, it’s clearly a black character,” Mr. McNeil said.","The discussion of biracial identity in Japan got a boost in 2015 when Ariana Miyamoto, who is half-Japanese, half-African-American, won the Miss Universe Japan pageant. She used her fame to discuss the plight of “hafus,” but some in Japan were unwilling to accept her as a model of Japanese beauty. ","In interviews, Ms. Osaka has embraced her multicultural background.","“Maybe it’s because they can’t really pinpoint what I am,” she said in 2016, “so it’s like anybody can cheer for me.”"

"At 17, Amanda Anisimova Bucks the Odds and Knocks Off a Seed - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Amanda Anisimova is seen by many as the future of American tennis, but she sometimes yearns for a second opinion from a third eye.","She drives by so many psychic readers around her home in South Florida. “I always want to go in,” Anisimova, 17, said.","“I’m kind of scared, because I don’t want to know what my future is going to look like: I want it to be a surprise,” she added. “But I want to hear what they have to say.”","No clairvoyance was necessary to see Anisimova’s potential as she dominated 11th-seeded Aryna Sabalenka, 6-3, 6-2, on Friday to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. That victory made Anisimova the first player born this century to reach the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, and the youngest American to do so since Serena Williams at the 1998 French Open.","Not all forecasts were accurate, however: Before the match began, a Tennis Australia “Win Predictor” graphic gave Anisimova only a 9 percent chance of beating Sabalenka, who was a popular pick to win the tournament among many pundits and the oddsmakers’ third favorite behind only Williams and Angelique Kerber.","“That’s a pretty rough number — I’m surprised by that,” Anisimova said. “But she’s a top player; she’s had such a great year. I was just playing really well, and she was playing really well, too. We had a great match, and it just ended up going my way today.”","Anisimova, ranked 87th, is likely to be undaunted by her next opponent: sixth-seeded Petra Kvitova, whom she beat last year in Indian Wells, Calif.","“Every player here is going to be great, and every round is going to be tough,” she said. “I just focus on myself, and I’m not really scared of anyone. I don’t fear anyone. I just have a lot of confidence in myself, and I’m ready for tough matches.”","Although Anisimova’s ability to dictate play against the ultra-aggressive Sabalenka gained more attention, one of her hardest matches came in her first round against the tricky veteran Monica Niculescu, who plays a game chock-full of funky slices that have driven many more established players crazy.","“There isn’t a teenager who would have won the first round against Niculescu besides Amanda,” said her agent, Max Eisenbud. “That match, until today’s match, was her most impressive win. The way Niculescu slices and throws everything at you, it was getting tight, and she was able to perform. A crafty, experienced girl who threw everything at her, and she still won in straight sets.”","Eisenbud also represents the player to whom Anisimova is most often compared: Maria Sharapova. While he said that comparisons between the two — blondes with Russian roots who stormed the tennis stage at a young age — were unfair to both, he observed that Anisimova and Sharapova did share a diligent work ethic and an ability not to be fazed in the biggest moments.","Frances Tiafoe, who also reached the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time on Friday, gushed over Anisimova, in his own way.","“It’s like she’s been a veteran,” Tiafoe said. “She’s going out here, and Sabalenka is playing great tennis — she routined her like it was nothing. It was barbecue chicken for her. It’s unbelievable.”","In her news conference Friday, Anisimova said that her confidence was growing.","“I believe in myself so much more than I ever did in this tournament,” she said. “It’s just trusting myself. That’s why I have been also playing really well.”","That confidence leads her to hope she can follow in Sharapova’s footsteps in another way: by becoming a Grand Slam champion as a teenager. Asked what her dream was for her career, Anisimova expressed a desire for instant gratification.","“I want to win this tournament — right now,” she said, smiling.","Anisimova, who broke through at the junior level by winning the 2017 United States Open girls’ title, complements her desire for immediacy with an uncommon curiosity about the past, expressing her admiration for Billie Jean King, the pioneer who played a formative role in getting women’s professional tennis off the ground.","“Back then it was so different and so difficult,” Anisimova said. “How much she worked, it was just crazy. Everything that she was doing just really surprised me. And that’s something also I remember: I tell myself I’m tired after an easy day — then seeing how much stuff she was doing? It was amazing how much she’s done for the WTA and women’s tennis.”","Modern issues are also a concern for Anisimova. She was particularly affected by the shooting last February that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., near where she trains.","“I’m not in a little tennis bubble,” she said. “The gun thing, it was so close to home. I know a girl who goes to that school, so it was just very scary. I just thought at the time — and I still think to this day — that guns are very dangerous and we shouldn’t be having them, using them.”","Anisimova was born in Freehold, N.J., but drew a blank when asked about the town’s most famous export. “Wait — Bruce who?” she asked. “Is he, like, old?”","After a few bars of “Born in the U.S.A.” were hummed and a brief description was provided, Anisimova acknowledged some faint recognition of Bruce Springsteen’s work but said it was unfair to expect more from someone born in 2001.","“Yeah,” she said, “how am I supposed to know that?”"
2019 Australian Open: Players to Watch - The New York Times,"Khachanov, a 22-year-old Russian, began 2018 ranked 45th in the world and enters the Australian Open as the No. 10 seed. He gave Rafael Nadal all he could handle in a hugely entertaining four-set match in the third round of the United States Open, and then won the Paris Masters  by defeating four straight top-10 opponents: John Isner, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and top-ranked Novak Djokovic. Khachanov, who is 6-foot-5, has a huge serve and a Western forehand with a long, flowing backswing that suddenly accelerates at the ball, giving the impression that he is a cracking whip. It makes the shot nearly impossible to read. ","Coric, 22, has not won a match in four previous trips to the Australian Open, but he had an extraordinary 2018: reaching a career-high ranking of 12th,  defeating Roger Federer twice and, with Marin Cilic, leading Croatia to its second Davis Cup title. A left-hander by nature who plays right-handed, Coric is 6-2 with a game that has evolved from a defensive, counterpunching style to a more aggressive, opportunistic brand of tennis. He has developed a superb serve, and his return of serve puts enormous pressure on his opponent. His two-handed backhand is considered one of the best in the game. His forehand, once a liability, is much improved. ","Medvedev, a 22-year-old Russian,  rose from No. 65 to No. 16 in the world in 2018 and attributes his ascent to a better serve and more control of his temper. He won in Tokyo in October with dominant serving, dropping just one set as he captured his third tour title. Last week, he reached the final in Brisbane with wins over Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, then lost in three sets to a resurgent Kei Nishikori. A lanky 6-6, Medvedev does not look powerful, but he hits the ball cleanly with perfect timing and with great disguise. He can serve bombs and also hit wide serves with a spin that opens up the court for his second shot. ","Sabalenka, a 20-year-old from Belarus, opened her 2019 season with a stirring three-set victory over Alison Riske to win the Shenzhen Open. Sabalenka began 2018 ranked 73rd, but under the tutelage of Dmitry Tursunov, a former tour player, she has risen to No. 11 by harnessing her prodigious power game and staying in points longer with improved shot selection. Her breakthrough came in the Cincinnati event in August, when she reached the semifinals with wins over Johanna Konta, Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Garcia and Madison Keys. She followed that by winning the Connecticut Open in New Haven, and then upsetting Petra Kvitova to reach the fourth round at the United States Open. The 6-foot Sabalenka serves with power and heavy spin, backing that up with a fearsome Western forehand. But what really makes her a threat is the way she plays fearlessly in the big moments of a close match.","Barty, a 22-year-old Australian, had a breakout season in 2018, winning her first Grand Slam doubles title at the United States Open (with CoCo Vandeweghe), and reaching a career-high singles ranking of 15th. In Sydney last week, she upset world No. 1 Simona Halep in straight sets. Barty has an exceptional all-court game, using her athleticism and wide array of shots to confound opponents. Although she is only 5-5, Barty leads the WTA Tour in second serve points won, using her heavy kick serve to pull the returner out of position and then attacking the first ball with her powerful forehand. With her superb volleys and overhead, Barty looks to attack the net, often approaching behind her one-handed slice backhand, which is considered the best in the game. Expect the Australian fans to turn Barty’s matches into rollicking events.","Keys, a 23-year-old American who was the runner-up to Sloane Stephens in singles at the 2017 United States Open, last year reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, as well as the semifinals of the French Open and the United States Open. But her other results were somewhat lackluster, and she enters this week ranked 17th. Keys struggled to find a coach to replace Lindsay Davenport, who stopped traveling to spend more time with her family. In December, Keys hired Jim Madrigal, who guided Tennys Sandgren on his run to the quarterfinals in Melbourne a year ago. At 5-10, Keys has one of the game’s best first serves, and she generates astonishing pace with her ground strokes. But she ranks only 27th on tour in second serve points won, at just over 47 percent. An improvement in this area could pay off for Keys. "
"A Wiser Naomi Osaka Adjusts to Stardom, Even as She Briefly Stumbles - The New York Times","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Deservedly No. 1 in the world at age 21, Naomi Osaka has not made it past the round of 16 in her first two tournaments wearing the crown.","After stumbling at the first hurdle in Dubai last month, she won two matches here in Indian Wells before running into Belinda Bencic.","Though it is too early to start scurrying around the halls and sounding the alarms, it is not too early to observe that Osaka is in the midst of an adjustment process that could take more time to work through than she imagined.","In a little more than six months, the Japanese-American with Haitian roots has become a multicultural star with global reach, fired the coach who helped her zoom to No. 1 by winning two Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and hired a new coach who had yet to be a head coach at this level.","It is a lot to handle, a lot to digest, particularly with people like me poised to parse every performance for signs of trouble.","Bencic gave her plenty to digest, beating Osaka at her own game on Tuesday by taking time and the initiative away as she ended Osaka’s title defense in just 66 minutes in the round of 16 by the no-argument score of 6-3, 6-1.","“Naomi was rushed and didn’t have time to dictate,” said Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion. “I don’t think Naomi had come across a player like that. All these big hitters like Aryna Sabalenka, and even Serena, are not that close to the baseline. They are two or three feet back. But Bencic plays an entirely different game, and she played a flawless match. She’s back, very back.”","The proof is in her 11-match winning streak, which includes a title in Dubai and five victories over top-10 players. Born in 1997, the same year as Osaka, Bencic has the skills to challenge her often in the seasons to come if she can keep her head and health together. Bencic will play fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova in the quarterfinals on Thursday.","“I think at a time like this with that score line, I would usually feel very depressed and sad,” Osaka said at her surprisingly upbeat post-match news conference. “But I feel pretty good right now, because I think given the circumstances I tried my best, and I don’t really have any regrets. I tried to be positive throughout the entire match. Honestly, she was just playing so well.”","It was not Osaka’s first look at Bencic, who turned 22 this month. They first played in a small-money event in Alabama on clay in 2013, and Osaka beat Bencic, 6-3, 6-3, which came as a shock considering that Bencic already was a highly regarded junior player from Switzerland and that Osaka had barely played junior tennis at all.","But there was no catching Bencic by surprise on Tuesday. She already had beaten Osaka in straight sets at the 2018 Hopman Cup team event, which is technically an exhibition. And after reaching the top 10 in 2016 and then dropping back because of wrist surgery, she is playing with the point-by-point focus of someone who knows that tennis success, with all its trappings, is not a given.","“I know how frustrating it was when I wasn’t able to play at all,” Bencic said, sounding sage beyond her years.","Osaka sounds a bit wiser herself. The meandering, sometimes cryptic interviews of 2018 have given way to something more considered and open with occasional dashes of her trademark whimsy.","This is not a coincidence. She watched clips of her past news conferences and did not like some of what she saw: the “ums,” the “likes.” At this new stage, she greets questions, of which there are many, with respect, giving the impression that she is weighing each one before answering.","Asked to compare herself now with when she won Indian Wells as an unseeded player in 2018, she gave another measured response, even in defeat.","“I guess one of the biggest things is I wanted to be more mature,” she said. “I feel like this is something I’m still working on — on and off the court. It’s one of the biggest goals that I have had in my entire life.”","“I might have thrown a few tantrums last year,” she added. “And this year it’s something that I’m working on improving, and I feel like it’s going well. I think I’m just more confident in myself.”","Dismissing Sascha Bajin, her silken-voiced German coach, was certainly a bold move. Under his guidance, she defeated Serena Williams, Bajin’s former employer, twice in 2018: once in the first round in Miami and once under much more duress in the United States Open final. With Bajin still by her side, but apparently no longer in her confidence, Osaka fought through another rough-and-tumble draw to win the Australian Open in January.","Neither has explained their split in detail, although Osaka has said it was not a matter of money. She or some members of her team were looking for a lower-profile coach, but there were clearly personal issues at work, too.","“Something happened that must not have been good, although that’s just speculation,” said Evert, who often watched Osaka and Bajin train in Boca Raton, Fla. “They were laughing and having fun practices and teasing each other, and it was great, and then just before the Australian and after the Australian, it was tense.”","Bajin is gone now, replaced by Jermaine Jenkins, a former standout at Clemson University who spent several years as the main hitting partner for Venus Williams, who dismissed her coach, David Witt, and Jenkins in the off-season.","Jenkins was quickly hired as a national coach by the United States Tennis Association to work out of its national campus in Orlando. He was just settling in when he got a text message from Osaka’s agent, Stuart Duguid, inquiring about his availability.","“I had a great new gig at the U.S.T.A., and I was doing my expense report and I get that text message,” Jenkins said with a chuckle this week. “When a great adventure is offered to you, you cannot refuse it.”","Jenkins, 34, knows full well that job security at this level is fragile, which is one of the big reasons he was drawn to the U.S.T.A. post.","“My wife and I live there in Lake Nona,” he said. “Plus, with the coaching carousel, I didn’t want to go back out with another player and then they wake up on the wrong side of the bed and say, ‘Hey I’m not feeling this.’ I was thinking more about security because there are only a few, I feel like, out there that are worth being out here for.”","Osaka, with her talent and star power, is certainly on that short list, and she and Jenkins are now 2-1 after their first tournament together, which included one on-court coaching visit that Osaka jokingly began by suggesting she was having a midlife crisis.","“I just wanted to break the ice,” she said.","Keeping the mood light and keeping tennis in perspective seem like the right idea when there are all sorts of new and powerful forces at work, including celebrity and megamillions.",This also seems a good time for Osaka to remember that the controlled power and controlled emotion that she displayed to win in New York and again in Australia were anything but a fluke.

Roger Federer’s 101 Titles: By the Numbers - The New York Times,"On March 2 in Dubai, Roger Federer joined Jimmy Connors as the only male tennis players in the open era with 100 career titles. With a victory on Sunday over John Isner in the final of the Miami Open, Federer, 37, is now eight titles behind Connors’s record of 109. ",Here’s a look at Federer’s 101 titles.,"The date Federer won his first career title, at age 19, in Milan, defeating Julien Boutter of France, 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-4. Federer was ranked 27th at the time, Boutter 67th. Boutter reached only two finals on the ATP Tour, winning one, and reached a career-high ranking of 46th. His last tour event was Wimbledon in 2004, a tournament Federer won. (The Milan tournament no longer exists.)","Number of Grand Slam titles — eight at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the United States Open and one at the French Open. His most recent came at the 2018 Australian Open.","The number of times he has won the tournaments in Halle, Germany, and his hometown, Basel, Switzerland — his most of any events. ","Number of titles on hard courts, most of any surface. (Hard courts are the most common surface on tour.) He has won 18 tournaments on grass and 11 on clay. His first title, in Milan, is one of only two on indoor carpet.","Most titles in one year, in 2006. The first came against Gaël Monfils in Doha, Qatar, in January; the last against James Blake at the Masters Cup, the former name of the year-end finals, in Shanghai in November.",The only year since 2001 in which Federer has not won a tournament. He sustained a knee injury in January and shut down his season in late July in order to fully recover. ,"Number of countries in which Federer has won a title, including Japan, Qatar, Sweden, Canada, Portugal, Turkey and the Netherlands.

Djokovic and Nadal Are Set for Another Epic Duel Down Under - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see that these past two weeks at the Australian Open have been nothing more than a warm-up for Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.","Maybe we should have kept from wasting time on the men’s side and gone straight to the showcase, the final on Sunday, when two titans will revive their rivalry and battle once again for the Australian Open crown.","The question of who would meet in the final became clear on Friday evening, as Djokovic cruised past the French underdog Lucas Pouille, winning, 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.","It was a demolition both thorough and brief, and it mirrored what Nadal had done in his final four clash the night before, when he dismantled fast-rising Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece.","Nadal took 106 minutes, lightning fast for a match at that stage of a Grand Slam. Djokovic versus Pouille lasted only 83 minutes, with Djokovic riding his precision groundstrokes and feline quickness to the win.","“A perfect match for me,” Djokovic described it. “From the first to the last point.”","He looked calmly self-assured as he said this — nothing like the doubtful athlete who struggled through a nasty elbow injury and upset losses in Melbourne in 2017 and 2018, during the one confounding low period in his career. His performance on Friday had a transcendent quality, he said, and he called such a feeling “divine” and “in the zone, where everything flows so effortlessly and you are executing everything you are intending to execute.”",He added that the semifinal was one of the best matches he had played on the sea blue center court at Rod Laver Arena.,That’s saying a lot.,"He was speaking, after all, of the court on which he will soon be aiming for a record seventh Australian Open title; of the court on which he won the first of his 14 major titles, when he beat another French player, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, in 2008.","It is also the court where he played one of the most stirring, and still the longest, Grand Slam finals in tennis history: the 5-hour-53-minute war of wills he won against Nadal in 2012, one of the greatest matches ever played, after which both players struggled to stay upright at the trophy ceremony.","“Hopefully,” Djokovic cracked, “we don’t go that long this time.”",You never know.,"Djokovic brawling against Nadal for the 53rd time — Djokovic leads, 27-25 — is expected to scintillate. It may awaken memories of when the two were younger, fresher, but not necessarily better, versions of what they are today, when they seem far and away the two best on the planet, their old rivals diminished or injured or close to retirement, their new rivals not ready yet.","For sports fans in the United States, this is one of those events worth setting the clock for, a match scheduled to start at the very uncivilized time of 3:30 a.m. Eastern on Sunday.","Just as in the run-up to the 2012 final, the Serb, Djokovic, is ranked No. 1 in the world, and the Spaniard, Nadal, is No. 2 and nipping at his heels.","But seven years on, they are also very different. The Nadal of Melbourne 2019 is riding a game he has clearly modified for this event — a change made, he has acknowledged, as an adaptation to being 32.","Here, at a tournament in which he has not lost a single set, he is looking to keep his legs spry, his troublesome knees healthy. He is hitting more balls on the short hop, sticking closer to the baseline, volleying more. He has also streamlined his service motion, cutting fat from his windup in a search for more accuracy and greater pop.","Djokovic can see the difference. Speaking of the man he described as his primary rival (take that, Roger Federer), Djokovic noted that the changes were working for Nadal.","“I think he’s backing his first shot up with that great serve, saving energy, and then he can go for more in the return game,” Djokovic said. “With everything he possesses, all the qualities in his game, adding a lot of free points on the serve makes him much tougher to play against.”","Both players have had to adapt, had to overcome recent difficulty, to get to this point. Nadal arrived in Melbourne with low expectations, having taken a hiatus from the tour after last fall’s United States Open, where he withdrew in the semifinals, citing a leg injury. In November, he had ankle surgery.","Dogged by his injured elbow at last year’s Australian Open, Djokovic was routed in the quarterfinals by Hyeon Chung, a South Korean ranked No. 58 at the time. That loss was one of a batch of stunning upsets he suffered in major championships after winning the French Open in 2016. Plenty of questions were swirling around him at the time. He often wore a hangdog, puzzled look on his face during matches, where once there had been nothing but ice-cold surety.",Would he ever return to form?,"But then, last summer, after elbow surgery and a remodeling of his priorities and his coaching team, the old Djokovic emerged. His health returned. So, too, did his steel-trap resolve. He won Wimbledon, beating Nadal in a five-set marathon that Djokovic credited here with giving “a different, more confident self.”","Later in the summer, he won his 14th Grand Slam at a sweltering U.S. Open, tightening his grip on the top of the men’s rankings.","Now he finds himself again in a Melbourne final, with a chance to repeat the glory of 2012, a chance for a 15th Grand Slam, just two behind the Spaniard’s haul of 17, within striking distance of Federer, who sits at 20 for most in a career.","At his postmatch news conference, I asked Djokovic to imagine a future conversation with his two children, who were not yet born seven years ago, and how he would describe that last epic Melbourne night against Nadal.","“How would I describe it?” he said, pausing before adding a touch of humor. “I’ll probably not have them sit down and watch it because I don’t like my children to watch TV that long.”",Then he grew serious.,“I would probably present it in more a general concept of our rivalry. That match would be icing on the cake.”,"On Sunday, seeking a seventh Australian Open title, he will have the chance to add more icing, indeed a whole extra layer, to that cake, to the legacy of a glorious career."
"At Australian Open, Osaka Holds Off Hsieh, a Big-Seed Slayer With a Bedeviling Slice - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — The reigning United States Open champion, Naomi Osaka, was serving to extend her third-round match against Hsieh Su-Wei when she rolled her right foot while running for a ball and tumbled to the ground, prompting the chair umpire to ask if she was O.K.","“No,” Osaka replied, but she was laughing.","Osaka, 21, who was born in Japan and is based in Florida, had already squared herself once, picking her game up after dropping the first set and falling behind 2-4, 0-40 in the second against Taiwan’s Hsieh, a big-seed slayer with a bedeviling slice.","By rising to hold off Hsieh 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, Osaka showed that she is more than O.K. She proved that she is maturing in front of everybody’s eyes like a Polaroid picture.","Osaka’s round of 16 opponent is Anastasija Sevastova, whom she defeated in three sets — after dropping the first — in the quarterfinals of a tuneup event in Brisbane two weeks ago. Osaka struggled with her composure early on against Sevastova in what turned out to be a prelude to a hissy fit.","In a straight-sets semifinal loss to Lesia Tsurenko, Osaka came unstrung. She committed 26 unforced errors, was broken three times and sulked between shots in a display that she apologized for later on her Twitter account.","“Had the worst attitude on the court today,” Osaka wrote. “Sorry to everyone that watched. I keep telling myself to be more mature but seems it’ll take a while.”","Fast forward to Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne two weeks later. In the first set against Hsieh, Osaka produced 20 unforced errors and was broken three times. So upset was Osaka by her start that she kicked her racket on the changeover before the second set, an act of petulance that resulted in her receiving a code violation.","“Of course I would have preferred not to do that, and I’m really sorry that I did,” Osaka said. “But hopefully I’ll learn from that moment.”","It seemed that Osaka had learned nothing from Brisbane when she stood five points from defeat. But a funny thing happened on her way to another dispiriting result. Osaka laughed at her plight, and that moment of mirth acted like a release valve, letting out all the pressure that had been building since she dispatched Serena Williams in straight sets in New York to win her first major title.","Instead of feeling, as she put it, “that either I win the match or I die,” Osaka relaxed and started playing calmer, smarter points, blasting her way into the tournament’s second week.","“She was just playing so well,” Osaka said, referring to Hsieh, “and I think I got overwhelmed. And then early in the second set I tried doing things that I know isn’t necessarily my game, like I was trying to hit higher balls and I don’t even practice doing that.”","She added, “Then after a while, I just started thinking that I’m in a Grand Slam. I shouldn’t be sad; I’m playing against a really great player so I should just enjoy my time and try and put all my energy into doing the best that I can on every point.”","In both her title runs in 2018, at Indian Wells and Flushing Meadows, Osaka won every first set. Her overall record last year when she lost the first set was 2-19. So she is pleased to have already posted two victories, against Sevastova and Hsieh, this month after slow starts.","“I think the more matches that I play like this, the tougher ones, then maybe as I go on it won’t seem as hard,” Osaka said, adding: “I’m happy with how I fought. For me, that’s one of the biggest things I always thought I could improve, because it sort of seems like before I would accept defeat in a way.”","Hsieh presented a stout test because the bigger the stage, the better she seems to play. At last year’s tournament, Hsieh upset the third-seeded Garbiñe Muguruza and the former women’s world No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska before taking the former champion and ex-women’s world No. 1 Angelique Kerber to three sets.","But as Osaka showed against Serena Williams in their U.S. Open final, she too embraces the big stage. “There is the most attention during Grand Slams, and more people come out than anywhere else,” Osaka said. “So definitely it makes me really happy, and I try to sort of channel that in my tennis.”","When Osaka is home, she trains at the academy in Boca Raton, Fla., run by the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Chris Evert and her brother, John.","“She’s very nice,” Osaka said, referring to Evert. “Whenever I do see her, she always comes up and says a lot of encouraging words, so I’m really grateful for her.”","Osaka’s eyebrows danced as she divulged a secret. Whatever advice Evert offers, Osaka absorbs it without question. For some reason, she added slyly, her coach, Sascha Bajin, and Evert can say the exact same thing, but it really resonates when Evert says it.","“Not that I’m, like, ragging on Sascha,” Osaka said, grinning, “but it feels like I should listen to her more in a way because — oh, I’m going to get so much hate — I have seen what she did and she’s also played. So it’s a little bit more believable.”","Before the tournament began, Evert described Osaka as “reliable.” And here Osaka is, right on schedule, two victories from a potential rematch with Williams in the semifinals.","Reliable? Yeah, that’s believable."
WTA Brings Coaches to the Forefront (Except During Matches) - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — To show a fuller picture of the sport, women’s tennis is shining the spotlight on the coaches who travel the tour with its players.","For 10 years, the WTA has allowed on-court coaching at regular tour events. At this year’s Australian Open, coaches have given news conferences of their own, following their players to the podium after matches. Last season, for the first time, the WTA awarded a Coach of the Year Award, which went to Naomi Osaka’s coach, Sascha Bajin.","But nothing drew more attention to tennis coaches than one getting in trouble. Coaching during a match is not allowed at Grand Slam tournaments, and Serena Williams was assessed a code violation in the women’s final at the United States Open in September when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, spotted her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gesturing toward her from his seat. His hand movements were replayed as much as any shot from the tournament.","Williams’s ire over the penalty, which she felt was akin to calling her a cheater, set off a series of penalties that overshadowed the match, which was won by Osaka.","Afterward, Mouratoglou admitted to making the signals, but added, “Everyone is doing it, 100 percent of the time.”","Four months later, at the Australian Open, he continued to insist that the rules should change because coaching from the stands is already “completely tolerated — except for one or two people who think they’re different.”","Ramos is officiating matches at this tournament, but he was not assigned to one featuring Williams, who lost in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. At least one prominent player — the men’s semifinalist Stefanos Tsitsipas — has been cited for illegal coaching in Melbourne.","“I think it should become legal because we stop hypocrisy, first of all,” Mouratoglou said. “Second, because it’s great for the show, and we want to have viewers who are not 50 years old. We want to attract the young generation, and we’re not. Tennis is not attracting the young people. And third, I think it’s good for the players.”","Despite the WTA’s calling for coaching to be allowed across the sport after the incident at the U.S. Open, neither the men’s tour nor the Grand Slam tournaments have moved in that direction.","Steve Simon, the WTA chief executive, said that coaches “contribute an integral element to the on-court and off-court WTA story.”",Simon’s predecessors have seen coaches as resources for enriching its product before. Allowing on-court coaching 10 years ago was motivated more by entertainment considerations than any desire for improving tactics.,"Larry Scott, then the tour’s chief executive, said the rule change came from a desire for “being as fan-friendly as possible and being as responsive to television as possible without altering the fundamentals of the sport.”","Holding news conferences with coaches is part of an initiative spearheaded by the tour’s communications manager, Chase Altieri, who came to the WTA in 2017 after working in the N.F.L., where coaches’ briefings have long been a feature of news media coverage.","WTA coaches have embraced the program, both for the chance to articulate their views and to ease the burden on their players. Bajin has made television appearances in lieu of Osaka to lighten her schedule of obligations during tournaments.","A new section of the WTA website includes profiles of the coaches, with details like their current and previous partnerships and off-court interests. Simon said the goal was to “bring our fans inside our sport.”","In recent years, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open have begun with allowing coaching during the qualifying rounds, with players able to walk to the side of the court where their coach is sitting during changeovers if they desire a consultation.","Mouratoglou is one of the strongest advocates for on-court coaching, even though his player never uses it. He said Williams’s sense of self-reliance was a weapon he would not dare muzzle.","“I think that her No. 1 quality is to be the best competitor ever, and I don’t want her to think that suddenly she needs someone to be a better competitor; that would make her weaker,” he said. “So, for me, it doesn’t make sense for someone like her.”","Mouratoglou, who has worked with Williams since 2012, owns a tennis academy that bears his name in France and has been a television analyst for ESPN and Eurosport. He said tennis had many untapped areas that could be mined for entertainment purposes.","“Coaching is part of the game,” he said. “If you show it, it’s an incredible adventure for the people to see.”","Before the Australian Open began, Mouratoglou even released a mobile game, Tennis Manager, which offers users the chance to simulate recruiting, training and strategizing with tennis players. Its slogan: “Shape a Champion; Become a Legend.”","Bajin, who worked alongside Mouratoglou for years when he was Williams’s hitting partner, comes down on the opposite side of the coaching debate, saying the rule should not be changed “to make it more interesting” to watch tennis.","“I think it takes away the purity that tennis was,” Bajin said. “My father put me out there on the court in order to become more independent, to learn how to handle problems, to learn how to be by myself, so that nobody can help me — and I think that still parents do that for their kids. That’s why they want them to start this sport, because it’s something special, and I wish we would keep it that way.”","But Bajin admitted that he, too, had occasionally tried to send illicit advice from the stands.","“Sometimes you try to sneak something by,” he said. “I’m guilty of that.”"
The Most Famous Man at the Australian Open Is Not Who You Think - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — It can take a long time for Dylan Alcott, a paraplegic 28-year-old from a nearby suburb, to maneuver his wheelchair from one place to another around the Australian Open.",He’s not slow; he’s just popular.,"“People used to stare at me when I was growing up because I was in a wheelchair, and I hated it,” Alcott said. “Now they’re staring at me because they know me. How amazing is that? It’s ‘Oh, that’s Dylan!’ Not, ‘Oh, there’s a guy in a wheelchair.’”","After first gaining recognition for winning a 2008 Paralympic gold medal in wheelchair basketball at 17, Alcott has come to dominate the quad division of wheelchair tennis, winning seven Grand Slam singles titles, including five at the Australian Open. He won his fifth in a row here on Saturday at Rod Laver Arena, which seats 15,000.","Quad tennis is a small and obscure world, often featuring only four players at major tournaments. But Alcott’s visibility extends far beyond the reach of a tennis stadium. He is the face of ANZ, a bank that is one of the Open’s major sponsors, and appears in advertisements around the grounds and on television. Alcott also served as a courtside analyst for Nine, the Australian network that broadcasts the tournament. During the rest of the year, he works as a radio host for national music stations.","When the broadcaster Gerard Whateley introduced Alcott at a meet-and-greet event on Monday, he made it clear Alcott needed no introduction: “You, sir, are inescapable!”",Being seen and heard as much as possible is a mission in itself for Alcott.,"“When I was a kid and I was getting bullied at school and I was really upset, I’d say, ‘I don’t know anyone like me, I don’t see anyone like me on the TV or on the radio or the newspaper, and that sucks! That’s not fair,’” he said. ",Alcott said he did not grasp the power of his celebrity until his commercials began to air last year.,"“We got videos of a little kid in a wheelchair, and every time the ad comes on, he rolls over to the TV and hugs it, because he saw someone like him on TV,” Alcott said. “We get hundreds like that, and that’s so cool.”","The attention can be exhausting, especially in the midst of competing in a Grand Slam event. Everywhere he goes around Melbourne, people stop, turn and smile in recognition. Though it can eat up hours of his day, Alcott swerves toward those people, rather than away from them, introducing himself and offering to take a photograph.","Alcott also has savored the acceptance of his fellow athletes with whom he has shared the locker room, especially the Australian ones who he sees year-round at Melbourne Park. Last Saturday, Alcott chatted with the 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer at the net when their sessions overlapped on a practice court.","“It’s like you’re just one of them,” Alcott said. “They treat me so well, it’s amazing. It’s cool, and I don’t think any other wheelchair athletes have that. They say, ‘Hi,’ and it’s like they don’t even know you’re in a wheelchair.”","They do notice Alcott’s popularity. Even Stefanos Tsitsipas, who became the Open’s breakthrough star when he beat Federer in the fourth round, deferred to Alcott’s celebrity.","“I introduced myself to Tsitsipas,” Alcott said, “and he said, ‘Mate, you’re the most famous guy here, of course I know who you are!’ I’ll take that. That’s surreal.”","Kris Dent, an executive with the International Tennis Federation, said Alcott’s appeal transcended sports."," “You can't fail to notice that when you come to Australia,” Dent said. “He's become much more than just an athlete. It's a phenomenal story that he has.” ","The top-ranked man in able-bodied tennis, Novak Djokovic, has tried his skills in a wheelchair across the net from Alcott, which he said made him appreciate the challenge and the craft of the discipline.","“Dylan deserves the popularity,” Djokovic said. “He’s a very great guy, very charismatic. I’ve said it before, these guys are heroes to me, they really are. They make the game of tennis more beautiful and more unique because of what they do and how they do it.”","After winning Paralympic gold medals in singles and doubles in 2016, Alcott was presented Tennis Australia’s Newcombe Medal, which goes annually to the country’s top player. Alcott said winning an award in a general category rather than one designated for disabled athletes “felt like breaking through.”","Alcott was born with lipomeningocele, which caused a large tumor against his spinal cord. He underwent his first of many surgeries at five weeks old. Health struggles continued throughout his childhood, with his ability to use his extremities worsening at times, both gradually and suddenly.","In 2012, an inebriated acquaintance tried to pick up his chair and dumped him onto the floor, which was covered in broken glass; Alcott severed an artery in his hand in the fall, damaging his ability to use his right hand fully, which is one of the reasons he competes in the quad division. That spelled the end of his wheelchair basketball career and led him to focus on tennis, which he had started playing around age 9 or 10.","“The biggest thing is being really proud of my disability, which is kind of different,” Alcott said. “Most people don’t want to talk about it. I always say, ‘Nah, let’s talk about it, openly and all the time.’ People buy into that.”","Though frank and candid about his challenges, Alcott also has tried to share the fullness of his life. ","“People that have a car accident think their life is over, because road safety ads say, ‘If you drink and drive and end up in a wheelchair, your life’s over,’ as a deterrence,” Alcott said. “People look at me and think it’s the same.”","That’s why in his autobiography, “Able,” a best seller published last fall, he said, “I talk about the first time I had sex, when I travel, everything. To be given the platform to do that, that’s so cool.”","The platform for Alcott’s tennis also is growing. His second round-robin match, a 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-5 victory over David Wagner, was broadcast live on national television. In his on-court interview, Alcott seemed more ecstatic about the viewership than the victory, hoping that disabled people around Australia had watched and drawn inspiration. (By contrast, he won the United States Open in September on an indoor practice facility rather than a main stadium because of rain.) ","Alcott, a hip-hop fan who has rapped on stage with Ghostface Killah, started his own music festival, Ability Fest, which catered to the needs of disabled people often left out of such events. The event featured interpreters for the deaf and elevated platforms for seated viewers.","Alcott also founded Get Skilled Access, a consulting group that works to improve how governments and corporations interact with disabled people. His foundation finances opportunities for disabled people because, he noted, he needs $8,000 for a wheelchair while his brother needed only $100 pair of shoes to play Australian Rules Football.","“It might not be Paralympics; it might be a cello, it might be a scholarship to go to university and become a lawyer,” Alcott said. “Why don’t we see people with disabilities in boardroom, in the mainstream? It’s because they haven’t been given the opportunities, and we want to provide that.”","Alcott had a 28-3 record last year on quad tennis circuit, which is for players with at least three extremities affected by a permanent physical disability. He hopes he, too, can grow into something bigger and more powerful than just a tennis player.","“I could win 20 Grand Slams and I’d be happy,” he said, “but I’d regret not doing what I love the most, which is changing perceptions of disability, which broadcasting helps.”",Alcott said he would like to move to New York or London to reach a wider audience.,"“Why couldn’t a guy in a wheelchair be the next Jimmy Fallon, or whatever it is?” he said.","As he started to expand on his vision for success in America, Alcott stopped and gestured to something much closer: a girl standing a few meters away, staring at him with a huge smile and tears in her eyes.","“Hello! I’m Dylan,” he said. “How are you, what’s your name? Jessica, what’s going on? Want to get a photo?”"
Novak Djokovic Leaves No Doubt in Winning His 7th Australian Open - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — The first point of the Australian Open men’s final on Sunday told the story of all that was to come.","With his opening serve, Novak Djokovic stretched Rafael Nadal wide, sending the Spaniard sprawling. Djokovic quickly had his longtime rival exactly where he wanted: off balance and unglued.","In a flash, as Nadal spun 360 degrees and scrambled to recover, Djokovic took a half-dozen confident steps forward. He lined up a backhand and then unleashed a buzzing winner that Nadal did not even try for.",Point won. Point made. Rafael Nadal: toast.,"The match, held at Rod Laver Arena on a warm and slightly breezy evening, finished just 2 hours 4 minutes later, Djokovic winning in a full-blown knockout, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.","This was a win that tightened the 31-year-old Serb’s hold on the top spot in men’s tennis. It also elevated his name once again in the annals of tennis history. He now has a record seven Australian Open titles and has moved to sole possession of third place for major titles, with 15, breaking a tie with Pete Sampras.",The three powerhouse sets were as fine and dominating as Djokovic — or anyone — has ever played in a major tournament final.,"“It ranks right at the top,” Djokovic said, assessing his performance at a news conference. “At this level, under these circumstances, it was truly a perfect match.”",He could not have seen this coming. Nobody could.,"Djokovic versus Nadal, No. 1 vs. No. 2, was arguably the most anticipated match of the tournament. It was the first occasion in which these two tense rivals — who have now played 53 times on tour, with Djokovic winning 28 — had met in the finals of a Grand Slam event since 2014, when Nadal slipped by Djokovic in four sets at Roland Garros in Paris.","Given the scintillating way both had performed throughout the tournament, with Nadal winning every set he played in his first six matches and with Djokovic winning all but two, it seemed certain that they would duel once again deep into the Melbourne night.","It was a match that was expected to dust off hallowed memories of what might have been their greatest combined moment of glory. In 2012, the two played one of the most epic finals in Grand Slam history, right on Laver’s sea-blue center court: a 5-hour-53-minute marathon won by Djokovic, the longest major final ever.",But a reprise was not to be. What unfolded was not even a reasonable facsimile.,"Still, the night had its own way of being unforgettable. The final failed to offer drama, but it did present beauty — that of a top-flight athlete, among tennis’s greatest champions, operating at the very peak of his powers.","“Things started so quick,” Nadal said, snapping his fingers twice to emphasize the point. “He was pushing me to every ball. He played so well. He hit so long. His return was fantastic. He was super quick.”","Nadal, 32, did not appear particularly downcast after the match. Instead, it seemed as if he had simply resigned himself to the result. He noted that he had been injured and had not been able to prepare for the tournament as he had wished. Indeed, after pulling out of his semifinal match at the United States Open last September and then having ankle surgery, he had not played a match on tour until this tournament began.","But he also allowed that there had been nothing he could really do on Sunday against Djokovic, saying it “was unbelievable, the way that he played, no doubt about that.”","Djokovic made only nine unforced errors. He lost just one point on his serve in the first set. He aggressively shortened every rally he could, keeping them to an average of five shots, a stunningly low number considering the long-distance finals he and Nadal have slugged out in the past. Riding pinpoint accuracy and depth, he so flummoxed Nadal that the Spaniard once swung and whiffed on a forehand.","Nadal, whose tally for major titles remains at 17, three behind Roger Federer’s record, threw all he could muster at the match, especially as it drained from his grip. He worked in as many drop shots as he could. He altered positioning on his returns. He moved early, trying to guess which way Djokovic was serving.",Nothing worked.,"Djokovic led early in every stanza and never looked back. There was no tension. The match was shorter by 23 minutes than Saturday’s stirring women’s final between Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova, which also unfolded in three sets but was blessed by tension at every turn.","“For me, one of the most important objectives for the match was to start off well and bring the intensity and make sure that he also feels my presence,” said Djokovic, who looked remarkably calm and centered, both during the match and afterward. “He always makes sure that the opponent across the net feels his presence. That is how he plays. That’s how he behaves. He brings so much energy, jumping around, sprinting.","“It was crucial for me to start off with an early break. Having a set under my belt just made me relax a bit more, not really worry too much. After that, it was smooth.”",Smooth. Perfect summary.,"It was a rare lopsided Grand Slam final between men’s tennis greats, reminiscent of Nadal’s wipeout of Federer at the 2008 French Open and John McEnroe’s rout of Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in 1984.","But it should not be forgotten how far the two came to get to the finals, the hurdles overcome. There is Nadal with his injuries, which have piled up over the years, especially on hard courts. There is Djokovic with the way he struggled with his confidence and his health after winning the French Open in 2016. For two full tennis seasons, it felt as if he was lost in the wilderness, in matches including a fourth-round loss at Melbourne Park last year to the unseeded South Korean Hyeon Chung.","Djokovic underwent elbow surgery not long after that match. At first, the operation did not help his on-court results. He appeared to be a doubting and unhappy shadow of his self. Improbably, he found his game on the Wimbledon grass, winning the title there and then following that up with another championship at the U.S. Open in September.","According to the International Tennis Federation, Djokovic is the first man to record three streaks of three or more Grand Slam titles in a row. He won four straight from Wimbledon in 2015 to the 2016 French Open, and three in a row from Wimbledon in 2011 to the 2012 Australian Open.","His chance to hold all four major titles at the same time will come in four months at the French Open, which he has won only once (Nadal has been the champion at Roland Garros 11 times).","Sustain this level through the United States Open, and it is not impossible to imagine him winning a calendar-year Grand Slam. No man has done that since Rod Laver in 1969.",And what about reaching Federer’s record 20 Grand Slam titles?,"Asked about those milestones on Sunday, Djokovic was his typically reflective self.","“I am aware that making history of the sport that I truly love is something special,” he said.","He then gave a nod to the kind of uncertainty that he knows very well, firsthand: the way injuries and loss of confidence can shake the very best of foundations. There are no sure bets.","“How many seasons are to come? I don’t know,” he added, noting that he was trying hard not to get too far ahead of himself. “I do want to definitely focus myself on continuing to improve so I would be able to compete at such a high level for the years to come — and have a shot at eventually getting closer to Roger’s record.",“It’s still far.”,"True, but if he keeps playing in the fluid, focused way he did on this Sunday evening in Melbourne, 20 Grand Slams will come into focus soon enough."
"At the Australian Open, Young American Men Seize the Moment - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Could the 2019 Australian Open be the Grand Slam tournament in which a budding cast of young American men breaks through?","The odds remain against that happening — thanks in part to a guy named Roger Federer — and there remains much tennis to be played. But after a pair of second-round upsets by Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz on Wednesday, the stage just might be set.","The first surprise came when Tiafoe, who turns 21 on Sunday, finished off fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson behind powerful forehands and serves. It was the biggest win of Tiafoe’s young career and the biggest shock of the tournament so far.","“C’mon!” he shouted, rolling up his right shirt sleeve, then thumping his right biceps repeatedly with his left hand, a move that seemed freighted with both bravado and relief. Tiafoe, the son of immigrants from Sierra Leone who learned the game at the Maryland tennis club where his father was a custodian, has long been touted as a prodigious talent. But he has also seemed burdened by the weight of expectations.","“It means the world to me,” Tiafoe told a crowd he had clearly won over during the tense three-hour match.","The arena scoreboard flashed with the final score, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5, telling a story of its own. Early on, Anderson had pushed ahead, leading by 3-0 in the second set after winning the first. Then Tiafoe turned the tide.","“I lost to Kevin three times last year,” Tiafoe, ranked No. 39, explained in an on-court interview. “I was down a set and break today. I went to a different place. I dug deep. It’s just how bad you want it, and I wanted it bad.”","Indeed, in the beginning, it looked as if Tiafoe might soon be flying home for more practice at the United States Tennis Association’s campus in Orlando, Fla., where many young American hopefuls train. But then he altered his approach — and flashed the kind of game that he will have to employ if he is to get past Andreas Seppi of Italy, a tour veteran ranked No. 35, in the third round.","He had decided to “kind of just mix it up,” he explained. “Play smarter. Don’t try to go for cannons. Be unpredictable.” Once he settled on a game plan, Tiafoe was particularly effective mixing a slew of low-bouncing slices into his powerful repertoire, forcing Anderson out of his comfort zone, making Anderson bend and contort his 6-foot-8 frame.","How far can Tiafoe go at this tournament? When I posed that question to him, he was succinct. “To the third round, man,” he said, before laughing slyly.","Should Tiafoe beat Seppi on Friday, he would find himself deeper in a Grand Slam tournament than he has ever been. Maybe because he’s keenly aware of that fact, he leaned on a tried-and-true sports cliché — but one that might show he has enough locked-in maturity to do real damage right now. He said he couldn’t afford to consider anything more than the next match.","“Look at today, I mean, he is five in the world,” Tiafoe said, referring to Anderson, who is actually ranked No. 6. “I was able to beat him. It’s so tight now. Anybody plays a good match, you can beat anybody on a given day.”","Fritz, 21, a Californian ranked 50th, can only hope those last words ring true. Shortly after Tiafoe’s win, Fritz upset 30th-seeded Gaël Monfils of France, 6-3, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5). The match featured some of the most exquisite shotmaking of the tournament’s opening days.","Like Tiafoe, Fritz has never advanced past the third round of a major. But Fritz’s next opponent is Federer, the two-time defending champion and No. 3 seed. The two have played only once: Federer won a tight three-setter on grass in 2016, as Fritz was just starting out on the tour.","“I learned my lesson last time we played,” Fritz said. “I won the second set, and it was one of the most amazing feelings I have ever had playing tennis, winning a set off Roger Federer! And then we were deep in the third and I had a chance to break his serve, and I started thinking: Oh my God, I am about to beat Federer. I might beat Federer.",“And then that thinking definitely lost me the match pretty quick. I didn’t win another game after that. I have definitely learned I just have to treat it like any other match.”,"Playing Federer in Melbourne will not be any other match, of course. Same for Tiafoe, when he battles Seppi. But both matches present a real opportunity.","“Between Frances and Taylor today, we saw something different, something better, an intensity and composure I have never seen before,” said Martin Blackman, the U.S.T.A.’s general manager for player development. “All of our players can learn from this.”","Blackman oversees a group that includes the 7-footer Reilly Opelka, 21, who upset ninth-seeded John Isner on Monday before losing a five-setter on Wednesday, and Mackenzie McDonald, 23, the former N.C.A.A. champion who fell in four tight sets to sixth-seeded Marin Cilic.","If any of the young American men are to begin making a bona fide dent in pro tennis, there is no better time to start than now."
"Serena Williams Defeats Simona Halep, Ranked No. 1. Anyone Surprised? - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Simona Halep of Romania is ranked No. 1 in the world in women’s tennis. Last season, she won her first Grand Slam title, on the red clay of Roland Garros.","On Monday night at Melbourne Park, she faced an opponent who, if judged by the numerical listing spit out by the pro tour’s computer, should have been handled by Halep with relative ease. Except that player, currently ranked 16th in the world, is no slouch. That player, in fact, is Serena Williams, pure greatness in fishnet tights.","Halep versus Williams in the round of 16 was a rare moment in tennis. It was a match in which the top-ranked player was also the decided underdog. Not only was Halep facing a formidable opponent with 23 major titles, seven of them in Melbourne alone, but she was also confronting someone who had dominated their career head-to-head matchups, winning eight times and losing just once.","So it was hardly a shock that Williams ended up improving that record on Monday, rolling past the 27-year-old Halep by a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 score.","In the quarterfinals, Williams will now face seventh-seeded Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, who easily defeated Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain, 6-3, 6-1, to advance. Williams has beaten Pliskova twice in three matches, but the one loss came in the United States Open semifinals in 2016. Pliskova, meanwhile, has won all nine matches she has played this season. Williams will be the lower-ranked player when they meet but is again the actual favorite.","“I have to return better, but I will be ready,” Williams vowed as she looked ahead to Pliskova. “She’s ready, I’m ready, let’s do it.”","It was vintage Serena confidence. And it also stood in contrast to her demeanor at the very beginning of her match against Halep. In those opening moments, Williams actually seemed shaky. She lost her first service game, the product of uncharacteristically poor shot-making and a clunky double fault.","But in a flash, Williams got going. Playing with great precision, she continuously sent balls deep and into corners, often for winners.","Game after game flew by, six straight in all decided in Williams’s favor. At the age of 37, she simply did not allow her younger opponent to find her rhythm. Total time for the opening set: 20 minutes.","“I felt like I’d been hit by a train,” Halep would say later.","“I played really good,” Williams said when asked about that first set. She spoke in a plain, matter-of-fact tone.",A question came: “Were those six straight games the best you had played since coming back last year after the baby was born?”,"“I don’t know,” she replied, “but probably.”","Still, Halep is among the most tenacious fighters in tennis, and as the match progressed, she began extending the rallies, which is more to her liking and style. She began serving better, fending off Williams’s attacks.","“I felt that my level is growing,” Halep said afterward. “And I had more confidence.”","And after capturing the second set, there was a brief period in the third when Halep appeared to have Williams on the ropes. Williams looked fatigued, her movements slower and less sure. But midway through that final set, Williams fended off three crucial break points. In the last, she pinned Halep into a corner and blasted a backhand winner down the line.","As happens so often in tennis, Halep had trouble bouncing back from missing such an important opening. And as happens so often when Williams seems to be in trouble, she broke serve in the next game, seizing control with a string of strong baseline replies.","When the last game of the match arrived, Halep offered meager resistance. Williams had prevailed again. Total time: 1 hour 47 minutes.","Afterward, Halep was asked about the dynamics of taking on Williams, and whose confidence should have been higher when the match began.","“You are ranked No. 1, and she is Serena Williams,” the questioner began before Halep politely cut him off.","“Exactly,” she said.","That one word response said it all, for Halep and for all of the women not named Serena who end up at the top of the computer rankings so long as she is playing.","Williams now seems to be closing in on her old form after taking time off following the 2017 birth of her daughter. Even with that layoff, Williams still made the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year. At the U.S. Open, she lost the final to Naomi Osaka in a swirl of controversy and accusations of sexism.","Williams is on a collision course with Osaka again. Seeded fourth in Melbourne, Osaka advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Anastasija Sevastova on Monday. Osaka next plays sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina and could face Williams in the semifinals.","Williams’s goal is clear and right there for the taking. If she wins her next three matches, she wins her 24th Grand Slam title, at last equaling the Australian great Margaret Court’s total of major singles championships.",Will she?,"Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, offered the strongest assessment.","“I believe she will,” he said. “She is ready physically, I think emotionally, too.”","“She is back,” he added, “to being Serena.”"
"Simona Halep Manages to Beat Kaia Kanepi, This Time - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — For Simona Halep, it was better to think that the United States Open wasn’t held last year.","“Never happened,” Halep said, grinning. “That tournament didn’t exist.”","Top-seeded Halep was ousted from that tournament within its opening hours, blasted off the court by Kaia Kanepi in a 6-2, 6-4 demolition that sent shock waves through the newly built Louis Armstrong Stadium.","Five months and 10,000 miles removed from that scene on Tuesday evening at the Australian Open, Halep was able to build back her sturdy defenses, digging into a gritty first-round rematch and defeating Kanepi, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-4, in 2 hours 11 minutes.","Halep, who has had a tendency to give into negativity when being outplayed, did not relent this time. She expressed frustration, exasperation and disbelief after Kanepi struck many of her 40 winners, but remained dialed in throughout.",Halep said all she could control was her effort.,"“I think it’s the best match I played in the last period, not giving up for one ball,” she said. “I think I improved in that direction.”","Halep’s consistent, rugged defense eventually outlasted Kanepi’s attacking; Halep hit only eight unforced errors in the final two sets, compared with 36 by Kanepi.","Though a first-round win against a player ranked 71st would not normally be a milestone for a top seed, it was a steep test for Halep. Not only had she been clobbered by Kanepi in their previous meeting, Halep had not won a match since, losing three times and pulling out of the year-end championships with a back injury.","Halep, who has maintained her No. 1 ranking despite not winning a match since August in Cincinnati, projected no precariousness. “If I’m thinking of all these things,” she said, “I cannot play tennis anymore.”","A No. 1 ranked player whose ranking merits a Wheaties box but whose dominance belongs on the side of a milk carton is hardly a rare phenomenon in women’s tennis. Dinara Safina, Ana Ivanovic and Angelique Kerber are among those went through crises of confidence when they reached the top of the ladder. Halep preached contentment, particularly after winning a long-awaited first Grand Slam title at last year’s French Open.","“I’m not putting pressure on myself anymore with the results, but I’m still motivated,” she said. “What comes now, it’s a bonus.”","Halep split with her longtime coach Darren Cahill at the end of last season, but she projected much of the clarity he instilled in her game — perhaps because the two are still in close contact. Cahill, also an analyst for ESPN, the American rights holder for the tournament, was on her court during pretournament practices.","“It’s great to have him around,” she said. “Also it’s tough that he’s not in my team anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. For sure, I need a coach, because at this level you cannot do it alone. I’m just chilling for the moment, and we will see after this tournament.”","Because of Halep’s slide, and the even distribution of titles around the top tier of the tour, nine women can leave Melbourne with the No. 1 ranking at the tournament’s end. Halep, who finished the last two seasons at the top, said retaining the spot was not in the front of her mind.","“The ranking doesn’t matter anymore,” she said. “I play tennis because I like it. Now my challenge is to win every match I play. I know it’s probably impossible, but I’m trying just to stay with this thought, and give it my best.”"
The Coaches Connected to the College Admissions Fraud Case - The New York Times,"The coaches led soccer teams and sailing teams, guided water polo champions and budding volleyball stars. At least two had won N.C.A.A. championships. A third gave Michelle Obama and her daughters tennis lessons from his post at Georgetown. ",The coaches charged Tuesday in a massive federal college admissions fraud scandal were some of the most prominent in their fields. But it was their apparent willingness to exploit their access to the admissions process at several exclusive universities that has them facing federal charges. ,"Who are they? Several had deep associations with the University of Southern California, where Donna Heinel, a senior athletic department administrator, is accused of playing a central role in the scandal. For nearly a decade, Heinel had overseen the admissions of athletes into U.S.C., working closely with several of the current and former Trojans coaches who have been indicted. She was fired Tuesday.",Here is a brief look at the current and former coaches identified by a federal complaint.,U.S.C. water polo coach,"Vavic won 16 national titles at U.S.C., more than any coach in university history (10 in men’s water polo, the most recent coming in December, and six in women’s water polo). He was fired Tuesday after he was arrested in connection with the admissions scheme. He had coached the women’s team, currently ranked No. 1 and the defending national champion, since 1995 and had been the sole head coach of the men’s team since 1999. A 15-time national coach of the year, Vavic was named the Pac-12 Conference’s “coach of the century” for water polo in 2015. ","According to the indictment, the co-conspirators in the admissions fraud paid $250,000 to an account that financed the U.S.C. water polo program, and in return Vavic recommended two students as recruits to the water polo team. The ringleader of the scheme, William Singer, known as Rick, is said to have paid the private school tuition for Vavic’s children through one of his company’s charitable accounts “under the guise of a fabricated scholarship.”",Former Georgetown tennis coach,"According to the indictment, Ernst, known as Gordie, earned more than $2.7 million between 2012 and 2018 in payments that were falsely labeled “consulting” fees. He “designated at least 12 applicants as recruits” for Georgetown’s tennis teams, court papers said, “including some who did not play competitively.” One such player, listed in the complaint, was encouraged to make playing tennis part of her application essay and claimed to be a top-50-ranking player in the U.S.T.A. for junior girls, which was not true. She was accepted at Georgetown in 2016. ","A spokeswoman for Georgetown said Tuesday that the university had fired Ernst in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. Ernst, a native of Rhode Island who is in the New England Sports Hall of Fame, was named the women’s tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last August. The university placed him on administrative leave on Tuesday. ",Wake Forest volleyball coach,"Ferguson has been the women’s volleyball coach at Wake Forest since 2016.

He was the American Volleyball Coaches Association coach of the year in 2009 and 2012. His success has not continued at Wake Forest, where he was 22-41 in his first two seasons. After Tuesday’s charges were unsealed, Wake Forest announced that he has been placed on administrative leave. Ferguson is accused of accepting $100,000 from Singer in 2017 to help Singer’s client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance to Wake Forest as a volleyball recruit.", U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach,"Salcedo has been U.C.L.A.’s men’s soccer coach since 2004. The Bruins are one of the nation’s top programs annually, and Salcedo has produced dozens of players who have gone on to play professional soccer. A former All-American at U.C.L.A. who had a brief career in Major League Soccer and other leagues, he has been a member of the Bruins’ soccer program as either a player, assistant coach or head coach for two decades.

Meredith was also a participant in the scheme, according to court filings. Meredith resigned as Yale’s coach in November after a disappointing season, but also after, the authorities said Tuesday, he had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of payments to facilitate the admission of a non-soccer-playing soccer recruit to Yale. When he stepped down after last season, Meredith told the university that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.” A month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. ",Stanford sailing coach,"Vandemoer is accused of taking financial contributions to his championship-winning sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission. “Neither student came to Stanford,” Stanford said in a statement Tuesday. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.” Stanford said Vandemoer had been fired.",Texas men’s tennis coach,"The Longhorns have one of the top programs in the country, having reached the N.C.A.A. tournament every season since Center took over in 2000.

According to court papers, the student’s application to Texas said he played one year of tennis as a freshman, but his other activities included being manager of his high school basketball and football teams. The student withdrew from the tennis team shortly after beginning classes at Texas. "
Roger Federer Outruns Time (and John Isner) Once Again to Win Miami Open - The New York Times,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — No matter how smooth and imperious Roger Federer looked in the Miami Open final, whipping winners seemingly on demand and breaking big John Isner’s serve on four occasions, Federer knows all too well how fragile this all is as the shadows lengthen.","There can be no doubt that Federer is back near top gear at 37. He is moving like a man 10 years younger and has a sparkling 18-2 record this season. After his 6-1, 6-4 victory on Sunday, he is the first man or woman to win more than one singles title in 2019.","“Kind of fitting,” Isner said of Federer ending that unprecedented streak of 33 different singles champions. “One of our game’s greats.”","Perhaps the greatest, though it remains so tough to compare apples to apples and Federers to Lavers. Comparing eras is seemingly as foolish an errand as writing definitive lists until Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are all done winning, too.","But Federer’s enduring excellence is an evermore elegant and persuasive argument, even if the reminders of how challenging it is for tennis champions to endure and prosper were right there in front of him again on Sunday.","There was his opponent, the defending champion Isner, 33, suddenly hobbling between points in the second set with a left foot injury that Isner fears could be a stress fracture.","“I have never had anything like this before,” said Isner, who began feeling the pain late in the first set.","And when it very soon came time for Federer to accept his fourth Miami Open singles trophy, one of the officials whose hands he shook was the tournament director James Blake, one of his former tour rivals who is now 39 and long retired.","“Roger, I don’t know what else to say,” Blake said after Federer’s 101st tour singles title. “It just makes me feel like such an underachiever.”","Nearly all the stars of Federer’s tennis generation have moved on to other roles: Tommy Haas, one of Federer’s closer friends, is now the tournament director at Indian Wells.",Federer made his debut in Miami in 1999 and is the only man who participated that year who is still playing singles.,"“It’s been a superlong journey for me here,” Federer said. “I got a wild card here in ’99 and made my first final here in 2002 against Andre Agassi.”","He went on to win the title in 2005, 2006 and again in 2017, the year when he roared back to the top after recovering from knee surgery.","That could have been his last hurrah, but the hurrahs keep coming with titles at Dubai and Miami in 2019 and a very close call at Indian Wells, where he was beaten in three tight sets by Dominic Thiem in the final.","But Federer bounced back convincingly in a familiar tournament in an unfamiliar place: Hard Rock Stadium, the Open’s new, much more capacious home after 31 years in the more intimate, boutique setting of Key Biscayne.","In 2018, when the event was still on an island instead of in an N.F.L. stadium, Federer lost in his opening round to Thanasi Kokkinakis. Though Federer had another scare in the same round this year against the qualifier Radu Albot, he rallied to win in three sets and then gathered nothing but momentum, winning five straight matches in straight sets.","“It’s easy just to say, ‘Well last year didn’t work out, so I won’t come back this year, and as I’m playing the clay, maybe add rather another clay-court event,’ ” Federer said. “But I felt like let’s extend the hardcourt season. Let’s see the new venue. To be honest, I think that was something also I was excited to see. I did feel like the game was there last year, and I thought also the game was definitely here this year even after the Australian Open. So I’m happy with the team, we took the right decision.”","The team has also agreed that Federer will play on clay for the first time since brief, unfulfilling visits to Monte Carlo and Rome in 2016. His next tournament: Madrid in early May, which will give him time to reboot and reacquaint himself with the game’s grittiest surface.",How confident is he?,"“Not very confident,” he said. “I don’t even remember how to slide anymore. You know, I’m taking baby steps at this point.”","It is smart, as ever, to try to underpromise and overdeliver, particularly when you are entering the kingdom of Nadal, the 11-time French Open champion and most successful men’s clay-court player in history.","But Federer, despite his fourth-round loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Australian Open, has certainly had another hardcourt run to savor in 2019.","He looked thoroughly in his element on Sunday, just as Isner feared and expected he would.","“I knew he was going to play well today; I knew he was seeing the ball very big,” Isner said. “Certainly that was the case. I wasn’t up to the task in the first set, that’s for sure.”","Before the final, Federer compared the experience of facing Isner’s serve to that of a soccer goalkeeper facing a penalty kick.","If you embrace that metaphor, he made a very quick save, breaking Isner in the opening game, blunting the power with sliced returns on the stretch and then hooking passing shots that even the 6-foot-10 Isner struggled to reach.",Federer rolled through his own service games in a hurry. He won all 20 of his first-serve points in the match and dropped only three points on his second serve.,"Isner, who had not faced Federer in an official match since 2015, would have needed to be very near the top of his game to stop this train or even get into one of his beloved tiebreakers.","But he was far from his peak and eventually in great discomfort, limping down the stretch after an injury timeout late in the second set and later wincing and limping off the dais in the interview room.","“You hope it’s nothing serious, and I hope he’s fine,” said Federer, who said experience helped him remain focused as Isner struggled. “But it’s tricky, no doubt.”",Tricky indeed to remain hale and hearty year after year in a Darwinian individual sport; even trickier to keep holding up trophies year after year with younger men swinging full force across the net.
Andy Murray Announces Retirement This Year - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Still struggling with a hip injury that has limited him since June 2016, Andy Murray announced Friday that he would retire after this year’s Wimbledon — if not sooner.",Murray said that his decision to end his playing career this year had come during his off-season training in December.,"“I spoke to my team, and I told them, ‘I cannot keep doing this,’” Murray said in an emotional news conference in Melbourne. “I needed to have an end point because I was sort of playing with no idea when the pain was going to stop. I felt like making that decision.","“I said to my team, ‘Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon.’ That’s where I would like to stop playing. But I am also not certain I am able to do that.”","Murray, 31, became the first British male singles champion at a Grand Slam tournament in 76 years when he won the United States Open in 2012. He won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016 and won Olympic gold medals in singles in 2012 and 2016. Murray reached the ATP’s No. 1 ranking for the first time at the end of the 2016 season, holding on to it through Wimbledon the next year.","A counterpuncher who wears down opponents through his elite physicality and guile, Murray earned a reputation as one of the hardest-working players of his generation. He is popular among his peers for an off-court affability that provided a striking contrast from his often ornery on-court demeanor. Murray was particularly admired by many in women’s tennis for his vocal support of their tour and his decision to hire Amélie Mauresmo as his coach in 2014.",Andrea Petkovic said that she had been an admirer of Murray “even before he kind of became WTA’s darling.”,"“He was always my favorite, and I think it will be a huge loss for tennis in general, but also for the WTA,” Petkovic added. “Because even nowadays, when you think everything is equal, you still need men, especially successful men, to speak up for women.”","Though often in the shadow of the others in the Big Four of men’s tennis — Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal — Murray is considered by many the greatest sportsman in Scottish history. He was knighted at 29.","Just two years later, with a ranking of 230 after the injury layoff, Murray accepted his mortality in the sport. The weight of the decision was obvious in his news conference on Friday, when he broke down after the opening question: “How are you feeling, and how is the hip injury?”","“Yeah, not great,” Murray said, his voice quavering. He then sighed and let his emotions flood in, and left the interview room for about three minutes to compose himself.","“Yeah, not feeling good,” he said when he returned. “Obviously, I’ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain. Well, it’s been probably about 20 months now.","“I have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better, and it hasn’t helped loads. I’m in a better place than I was six months ago but still in a lot of pain. Yeah, it has been tough.”","Murray said he still planned to play at the Australian Open, where he is a five-time runner-up. His first match will be Monday against 22nd-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut.","Murray’s outlook in Melbourne looked bleak even before his announcement. In a practice match Thursday, Murray was thrashed by his longtime rival Djokovic, who led 6-1, 4-1, before their time slot on the court ended.","“I can still play to a level — not a level that I’m happy playing at,” Murray said on Friday. “It’s not just that: The pain is too much, really. I don’t want to continue playing that way. I think I have tried pretty much everything I could to get it right, and that hasn’t worked.”","Murray had hip surgery last January, and he said he had seen his Melbourne-based surgeon on Thursday. He said that although the operation had helped, it had not alleviated his pain, which he said had been the “driving factor” in his decision.","“I can play with limitations, that’s not an issue,” Murray said. “It’s having the limitations, and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis.”","Asked if the Australian Open could be his last tournament, Murray paused and wiped away tears again.","“There’s a chance of that, for sure,” he said. “Yeah, like I said, I am not sure I am able to play through the pain for another four or five months.”",Murray said that his injury had also taken an emotional toll.,"“I have talked a lot, way too much, about my hip for 18 months,” Murray said. “It’s a daily thing. It isn’t just people I work with that ask me; it’s everyone. So everyone I bump into, that is all I talk about it. It’s pretty draining.”","Murray said that he had spoken “not loads, but a number of times” with psychologists about his injury.","“But nothing helps because you are in lots, lots and lots of pain,” he added. “You cannot do what it is that you want to do, and you love doing. Or I can do it, but it’s not fun or enjoyable doing it anymore.","“That is what I have done. I have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately. I wish it did, because if it did, it would be feeling brilliant right now. But it doesn’t.”"
"Against John Isner, Reilly Opelka Stands Taller - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — It started as a curiosity, believed to be the tallest match in tennis’s Grand Slam history.","And yet by the end of a nearly three-hour slugfest on the Australian Open’s opening day on Monday, fans left less impressed by all of the long-limbed height than by the guts of the surprising victor: the virtually unknown Reilly Opelka — 21, American, 7 feet tall in socks — who doled out an eye-popping upset by defeating his ninth-seeded compatriot John Isner, 33, who stands a looming 6 feet 10 inches.","Tennis players in the modern era trend taller than the players of yesteryear, even compared to those of 15 and 20 years ago. But not this much taller. In a sport where the best male players still typically hover around 6 feet (top-ranked Novak Djokovic is listed at 6-2), not only do Isner and Opelka seem like human skyscrapers, they come to the court for each match with the simplest game plan possible: Crush serves, slam forehands and hide their considerable deficiencies in movement by keeping every point whiplash short.","Staring across the net at Isner, Opelka said after the match, was like looking in the mirror, and not just because of his opponent’s height.","“There’s just a lot of things that are out of your control,” he said, speaking of the distress that comes from playing one of the few who can hit just as hard as he can, and from such high, imposing angles. “I was expecting that today I probably wouldn’t touch too many balls. I was hoping the same for him.”","Official match statistics back Opelka up. He did not touch many balls. The average rally lasted two shots. On only four points were at least nine balls struck. Isner slammed 47 aces. Opelka slammed 40, the last a 141-mile-per-hour fastball that Isner barely moved for.","The final score underscored how little separated the pair. Opelka, ranked No. 97, won, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5).","When it was over, Isner could barely hide the disappointment. He rarely made eye contact during the postmatch news conference. At times, his hands shook with tension.","He has long been ranked in the top 20 on the ATP Tour. Last season was his best. He won his first World Tour Masters 1000 at the Miami Open, made the semifinals at Wimbledon and, as one of the top players of the year, appeared in the elite tour finals in London.","But last season also started poorly, punctuated with a loss that was in some ways similar to the one against Opelka: a first-round defeat at the Australian Open at the hands of a little known, albeit much smaller opponent, Matthew Ebden, an Australian who stands a tour-typical 6-2.",Isner vowed to lean on the fact that he had begun last season in such bad shape — not only being upset in Melbourne but posting an early record of two wins and six losses — before breaking through and winning Miami.,"“I was off and running from there,” he said. “Just got to get one under my belt and see what happens.”","Though hardly one for long answers, Opelka appeared relaxed and casual as he spoke in the wake of the most significant victory of his young career. He spoke of the main difference between him and Isner. In the early stages of his career, Opelka, who is listed as 6-11 but has acknowledged that he is even taller, does not have a deeply successful professional past to hark back to.","Hence, even after Monday, his primary motive remains clear: Keep playing well enough that he never again has to compete in tennis’s often brutal minor leagues, where he won two titles at the end of last season to break into the top 100.","“That,” he said, “is the immediate goal.”",More than making a long run in Melbourne?,"Yes, he replied, saying he could only allow himself to think of his next match, against Thomas Fabbiano, an Italian who is ranked No. 102 and, compared to Isner, is a relative munchkin.","“One guy is 5-10,” Opelka said, referring to Fabbiano. “The other guy,” he added, referring to Isner not by name but with a pregnant pause, “is not.”"
Serena Williams’s Absence Gave Her Foes the Chance to Improve - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Time did not freeze, like a televised sporting event placed on pause, during the 13 months Serena Williams spent away from tennis. The absence of Williams, who has averaged one title in every three majors played, allowed younger players to wade deeper into the draws and grow their games and their confidence.","Karolina Pliskova, 26, was already on the rise when a pregnant Williams took her leave from tennis after winning the 2017 Australian Open. The previous year, Pliskova had graced the final of the United States Open, beating Williams on the way. But it was the only Grand Slam event where she advanced past the third round in 2016.","With Williams out of the picture from February 2017 to March 2018, the ascent of Pliskova continued apace. Advancing to the quarterfinals or better in 15 of 20 tournaments in 2017, Pliskova assumed the women’s world No. 1 ranking that July, two months after Williams’s last stay there.","In the eight majors contested since Williams’s last Grand Slam title, at the 2017 Australian Open, Pliskova has made it to the quarterfinals or better in five. With her 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 defeat of Williams on Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open on Wednesday, Pliskova avenged a two-set quarterfinal loss to Williams at last year’s U.S. Open.","The way Pliskova pulled out the victory was telling; she played the big points as fearlessly as Williams, 37, once did. Down by 1-5 in the third set, Pliskova won six consecutive games and staved off four match points by swinging for the lines and serving to dime-sized spots. She did to Williams what Williams did to Kim Clijsters in the 2003 semifinals here. In that match, Williams staved off two match points while climbing back from a 1-5 deficit, then beat her sister, Venus, in the final to hold all four major titles concurrently.","That Williams had an aura that sometimes all but overshadowed her. The Williams standing across the net from Pliskova hasn’t appreciably changed. In spotting the rest of the women’s game a full year, she simply gave everybody else a chance to catch up to her level of intensity and fight.","“This time I just feel somehow different and more confident,” Pliskova said. “I’m not doubting myself.”",Williams held her first match point while serving at 5-1 in the third. She was called a foot fault on her first serve. Then at the end of the point she turned her left ankle after Pliskova wrong-footed her. Williams never called for a trainer to treat her ankle.,"“At that point I didn’t feel like I needed it or I didn’t feel like it would be a big deal,” Williams explained.","There was a good reason she felt that way. Many times over the years, less than Williams’s best was good enough.",But that no longer is the case.,"Williams’s serve has always been the weapon she can lean on when all else fails. On Wednesday, Williams didn’t win another point on her serve after turning her ankle.","Williams said of Pliskova: “I think she just kind of started playing really, really good. I don’t think it had anything to do with my ankle per se.”","Williams was right. Did her level of play drop in the last six games? Yes. But to focus on that is to miss the bigger picture. Williams lost because during the year that she spent growing a child instead of a game, Pliskova and the other top players got better.","If Williams is to resume her winning ways, she will have to play better than she did in 2017, when she vanquished Venus here for her 23rd major title.","It is not impossible. Williams’s mission, if she chooses to accept it, is to forget the past and resolutely move forward, one honest day’s work at a time. The good news for tennis is that she seems committed to the chase of Margaret Court and her record 24 major singles titles.","This was Williams’s eighth official tournament since her return from a difficult pregnancy. The golfer Tiger Woods, with whom Williams is friendly, won the Tour Championship in his 18th official start after his return from back surgery. As long as Williams is patient, she can once again prosper.","Speaking earlier in the week, Williams’s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said it was unrealistic to expect Williams to hit the tour winning after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. She won no titles last year, but reached the final at Wimbledon and the United States Open, losing to opponents whose masterly performances kept her off balance.","“You cannot buy time,” he said. “Things take time. To get back to shape, back in shape after a baby, a few months are not enough. I mean, still she could have won because she’s doing things other people don’t, but it was — I mean, the story said it was too early. That’s it.”","Williams didn’t win six majors before her 22nd birthday because she was a patient person. But motherhood is a daily practice in living in the moment, and Williams is nothing if not a diligent student. Earlier in the tournament, she said her year off “gave me a new fire, a new purpose, a new meaning.”","It did the same for her opponents, which is why the women’s game is infinitely more interesting now that Williams is back."
Novak Djokovic Passes His Idol and Sets a New Target: Roger Federer - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — The first tennis player to capture Novak Djokovic’s imagination was a big-serving American with a beautiful one-handed backhand. A grade-school-aged Djokovic, living in the Serbian mountain resort town of Kopaonik, watched on television as Pete Sampras won one of his seven Wimbledon titles, and he fell madly in love with tennis.","“I did not have a tennis tradition in my family,” Djokovic said, adding, “To me it was definitely a sign of destiny to start playing tennis, to aspire to be as good as Pete.”","Djokovic tried to emulate Sampras’s game, right down to the one-handed backhand, before his first coach, Jelena Gencic, encouraged him to switch to both hands because that was his natural stroke. But on other things, Djokovic refused to budge.","Most significantly, Djokovic never abandoned the belief that he would grow up to be the best men’s player in the world, like Sampras, who held the year-end No. 1 ranking for a men’s record six years beginning in 1993, when a 6-year-old Djokovic began playing tennis in earnest.","On Sunday at the Australian Open, Djokovic finally and decisively slipped the surly bonds of Sampras. With his 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 defeat of Rafael Nadal, Djokovic secured his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking his tie with Sampras. Djokovic took sole possession of third on the list, behind his contemporaries Roger Federer (20) and Nadal (17).","When Sampras retired in 2002, he held the record for men’s Grand Slam titles. Unlike Djokovic, who has peers to push him, Sampras spent his career in a mostly lonely pursuit of a long-retired player, Roy Emerson, who collected 12 major championships, including a men’s record six Australian Open titles.","Emerson, 82, attended Sunday’s final at Rod Laver Arena, and, like the 47-year-old Sampras, he had a target on his back. Djokovic’s title was his seventh at Melbourne Park. When he met up with Emerson after the trophy presentation, Djokovic said, smiling, that “Mr. Emerson” was mad at him for breaking his record.",The careers of Djokovic and Sampras never intersected — Djokovic turned pro the year after Sampras retired — but their paths crossed in Los Angeles in 2013 when they played together (and lost) in an exhibition doubles match at U.C.L.A. against Bob and Mike Bryan.,"At the time, Djokovic described it as “a blast” to share the court with Sampras and said he had always hoped to play a match with or against him. Two months before the exhibition, Djokovic had collected his sixth Grand Slam title with his fourth Australian Open crown. But it wasn’t considered a given that he would one day share a piece of Grand Slam history with Sampras, much less move past him.","“To surpass him with Grand Slam titles, I’m speechless,” Djokovic said Sunday. “I haven’t had too much time to contemplate on everything that has happened, but I’m planning to do that.”","In 2014, Sampras returned to the Australian Open as a spectator, and while there, he sat for a news conference in which he fielded a question about the aging process for champion athletes.","Sampras was 31, the same age that Djokovic is now, when he retired. The grind of the tour, especially the extensive travel, eroded his motivation, Sampras said.","“As you get older, it just gets tougher,” Sampras said then. “It gets tougher to play. It gets tougher to travel. Sometimes it gets a little stale.”","He added: “I just know from my perspective, I was fatigued the last couple years. I was enjoying my tennis, but it was a tough job.”","Djokovic understands what Sampras meant. He traveled here without his wife and two small children. During the trophy presentation, Djokovic thanked his loved ones in absentia for their forbearance. He expressed gratitude for all the sacrifices they made so that he could maintain what he described as a selfish existence. He said that it was hard to be apart from his family for weeks on end.","“Hunger is always there,” Djokovic said, “but nowadays it’s just more relevant for me to organize myself in life better, to manage to be very concise and concrete with what I do and what I plan to do, because I am a father and a husband. Right now it’s not only about tennis.”","After his fourth-round exit here last year, Djokovic had surgery on his elbow, and that was tough, too, he said. He acknowledged having doubts about whether he could regain his championship form.","That sounds ludicrous now, with Djokovic in current possession of three of the four major trophies and needing only a French Open victory to complete a Novak Slam.","After passing Sampras, Djokovic has no plans to slow down. Many players, Djokovic was told, believe that he can surpass Federer on the major victory list.",“How do you live with that?” a reporter asked.,Djokovic laughed. “How do I live with that?” he replied. “Just fine.”
Kvitova and Osaka Will Play for Australian Open Title and No. 1 Ranking - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — What better way to kick off Australia Day weekend than with a win-one, get-No. 1-free special at Melbourne Park?",That will be the holiday bargain on offer inside Rod Laver Arena on Saturday when Petra Kvitova and Naomi Osaka square off in the Australian Open women’s final for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup and the top spot in the women’s world rankings.,"Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon titlist from the Czech Republic, advanced with a 7-6 (2), 6-0 defeat of the American Danielle Collins in the first of Thursday’s semifinals. Osaka, the reigning United States Open champion, engineered a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Kvitova’s compatriot Karolina Pliskova, who described Osaka’s play as “unbelievable” and said, “There was not much that I could do.”","Osaka, 21, can become the first Japanese singles player, male or female, to hold the No. 1 ranking, a piece of history that seemed well beyond her grasp last year at this time when she entered the tournament ranked No. 72.","“Of course that’s a very big deal for me,” Osaka said, adding, “I’m just really happy that I’m in the position that I am now, and I’m not going to take it for granted.”","Kvitova, who rose as high as No. 2 in 2011, didn’t know that No. 1 was within her reach here. “I don’t really care, to be honest,” she said.","Pointing to her head, she added, “I don’t think there’s any room here to think about it.”","She feels especially blessed to be playing for another major title. This is her first Grand Slam final since she fought off a knife-wielding burglar in her Czech Republic apartment in 2016. She sustained nerve and tendon damage in all five fingers of her dominant left hand in the attack, requiring hours of surgery to repair and sidelining her from competition for five months.","“I didn’t know even if I was going to play tennis again,” Kvitova said, adding, “It wasn’t only physically but mentally was very tough, as well. It took me really long while to believe.”","Since returning for her self-described “second career” at the 2017 French Open, the 28-year-old Kvitova has won seven tournaments, including five last year.","She started 2019 on a high note, prevailing in the tuneup event in Sydney. But for all her success, she had struggled in the majors; after winning Wimbledon for the second time in 2014, Kvitova didn’t advance to the semifinals in her next 16 Grand Slams. Her best showing was two quarterfinal appearances at the U.S. Open.","“For the mental side, it wasn’t really easy to kind of deal with that every time, coming to the Grand Slam and losing,” Kvitova said. “Maybe that’s why it’s probably more sweet.”","Osaka may be in her second consecutive major final, but she can remember when making it to the second week was a major victory. Before her breakthrough against Serena Williams last year in Flushing Meadows, Osaka lost in the third round of Grand Slams seven times and got as far as the fourth round only once.","“Man, for me it feels like it took awhile,” Osaka said. Laughing, she added, “Maybe my time goes slower than your time. But definitely I remember all the matches that I lost in the third round.”","Osaka used to become easily frustrated. The biggest change that her coach, Sascha Bajin, has noticed in this tournament is that she is controlling her emotions better when points don’t go her way.","“I just have to tell her grass is green, water flows and everything is all right sometimes,” Bajin said. “Over all, she’s very hard on herself. She has very high expectations. She wants to do well. She wants to get better.”","Kvitova was the same age that Osaka is now when she claimed her maiden Wimbledon crown, in 2011. Back then, her career stretched before her like a clear ribbon of highway. Sure, there were a few potholes, but nothing she couldn’t get past. Then came the attack in her apartment.","Kvitova said she found out only recently that in the early months of her recovery, her doctor wasn’t optimistic about her returning to competitive tennis.","“Luckily he didn’t tell me, like, during that period,” Kvitova said.","Last summer, Kvitova met Monica Seles, who arranged the introduction. “It was such a nice feeling to meet someone who kind of went through same things and thoughts and everything,” Kvitova said of Seles, who was stabbed by a spectator during a match in 1993.","Seles returned to competition, and won the Australian Open in 1996 for her ninth major championship.","“I didn’t know that, actually,” Kvitova said. “It’s nice then.”","Whatever happens Saturday, Kvitova feels as if she has already won. “To be honest, I think not very many people believe that I can do that again, to stand on the court and play tennis and kind of play on this level.”"
Sam Querrey Advances to US Men's Clay Court Semifinals - The New York Times,"HOUSTON — Eighth-seeded Sam Querrey advanced to the semifinals in the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Friday, beating Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4).",The American saved two set points in the opening set and one in the second.,"""My first two matches were pretty clean, but this match was more about fighting your way through it,"" Querrey said.

Serena Williams’s Practices Add a Wrinkle: A Top Men’s Player - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — After 170th-ranked Christopher Eubanks made it through the qualifying draw of a Grand Slam event for the first time last week, many of his friends from back in Atlanta began to grasp how far his career had come.","It was not because of the three qualifying matches he had won, but rather because of who joined him for a practice before the Australian Open began: Serena Williams.","“Some of my friends who don’t really know tennis were saying, ‘If he’s hitting with Serena, he must be pretty good,’ ” Eubanks said.","His session with her was part of a new strategy for Williams, who is training with some of the best current players from the men’s tour to raise the intensity of her practices. In addition to Eubanks, Williams has practiced this month with No. 15 Stefanos Tsitsipas, No. 21 Grigor Dimitrov, No. 39 Frances Tiafoe and No. 88 Bernard Tomic.","Asked about her practices with such players, Williams said simply, “It was fun,” but her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, was more loquacious.","“If she lifts her level on a daily basis that much, she’s going to improve incredibly,” he said.","The early returns from the strategy have been positive: Williams beat Eugenie Bouchard, 6-2, 6-2, in the second round on Thursday night, thwarting the resurgent Canadian with sharp, focused aggression. Williams was particularly strong on her return, winning 61 percent of points on Bouchard’s serve.","Mouratoglou said the shift to finding the best male opposition available was “a long-term plan,” not a temporary trend.","“I think that it’s very important in your practice to be challenged, because I think that she can become much better than what she is already,” Mouratoglou said. “But in order to become better, if you’re not challenged, you have no chance. I thought that to be challenged at practice was a good idea, so we tried once and we really loved it.”","That first try, Mouratoglou said, was with the Australian player Thanasi Kokkinakis last year at Mouratoglou’s academy in France.","“She said: ‘Wow, it was great, great rhythm, and it’s tough. It pushes me,’ ” Mouratoglou said. “I thought she played incredible.”","Kokkinakis, who had beaten Roger Federer earlier that spring at the Miami Open, shared that assessment, marveling at his inability to push Williams back from her position on the baseline even with his hardest, heaviest shots.","“She’s so, so strong on the ball,” he said. “When I thought I hit some good shots that even some male players might even struggle with, she took it on the rise, handled it pretty well.”","Williams has practiced with men throughout her career, usually employing a man as a full-time hitting partner. Most have been years removed from their active days on tour and had achieved modest rankings. Her longtime hitting partner Sascha Bajin peaked at 1149th; his successor, Robbye Poole, reached 414th; her current hitting partner, Jarmere Jenkins, reached a high of 190th.","Mouratoglou said that Jenkins was “still hitting the ball really well,” but that it was important to shake Williams out of her routine with him when possible.","“She basically knows where he’s going to hit in advance, because she hits with him every day, so there is no surprise,” Mouratoglou said. “She doesn’t feel that she’s challenged because she knows him too well. I think that counts a lot. And she controls him, in a way, because he’s her employee. Even unconsciously, she makes him play the way she wants to, even if she doesn’t try to.","“So it’s completely different relationship with a professional player, because she has to give him good rhythm, to give a good ball to him, too, so she can’t lose focus.”","Other top men and women have shared practice courts in the first month of the tennis season. Andy Murray and Naomi Osaka, for example, hit together for 30 minutes at a tournament in Brisbane, Australia.",Mouratoglou said that he emphasized to the men that they should not treat Williams differently from any other practice partner.,"He said he told Eubanks, “Play for yourself — it’s your practice.”",Eubanks said the session with Williams helped him in his first-round loss Monday against 19th-seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili. Eubanks had set points to go up by two sets to one on a player ranked 150 spots ahead of him.,"“Serena hits, in my opinion, one of the cleanest balls in the history of tennis,” Eubanks said. “I was working on absorbing pace, because she puts enough pace on it that you’re really working the legs. I’m being as professional as I can, because you’re on the court with Serena Williams. You don’t want her to think you can’t play.”",Eubanks said he felt the effects of Williams’s intensity and skill the rest of the day.,"“I practiced again in the evening, and I told my coach I felt like I did a lift today, because my quads are so sore from just hitting with her for an hour,” he said.","After Williams’s victory over Bouchard, the on-court interviewer Jim Courier joked that she should charge the men she hits with for lessons. Indeed, many of Williams’s past practice partners have been thriving in Melbourne: Tsitsipas, Tiafoe and Alexei Popyrin have reached the third round at the Open for the first time.","“Just to hit with a legend, especially Serena, it really gave me a great, great experience,” Popyrin said after No. 7 Dominic Thiem retired from their second-round match Thursday. “She gave me some tips after the hit, so it was great.”","Tiafoe, whom Williams hit with several times while they were teammates at the Hopman Cup, had his best career victory on Wednesday when he beat fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson in the second round.","Tiafoe said he had difficulty handling Williams’s zipping shots, as he was more used to the spinning shots male players tend to use.","“I was struggling,” Tiafoe said of hitting with Williams. “She hits the ball so hard. The courts are fast; it was skidding. I mean, a little topspin, maybe? I’m not used to the ball coming in that flat. That was something I really had to adjust to.”",Mouratoglou said no man had turned down an offer to hit with Williams.,"“And I don’t think any will say no,” he said. “It’s a great experience for them, too, and I think they’re curious how Serena is hitting, for real.”","For Eubanks, Williams’s story had particular resonance. His father coached him in Atlanta following many of the tactics and philosophies of Serena’s father, Richard Williams.","“Being able to see somebody who comes from humble beginnings, somebody who has dealt with adversity her entire life, seeing someone who comes from an unconventional tennis background, it shows it can be done,” he said.","“I’ve gotten to the point now where I don’t really get star-struck when I see people,” he added. “I’ve practiced with Fed a couple times. I’ve seen Novak, seen Rafa. You see them and understand that they’re people. But Serena, there’s something about her that’s almost larger than life. So when I got out there and she said my name, it took me back to as if I was a little kid: ‘Man, Serena Williams knows my name!’ ”"
"Danielle Collins Upends the Australian Open, and Her Family’s Schedule - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Ann Chisholm contemplated traveling from her Minnesota home to watch the main-draw debut of her cousin Danielle Collins at the Australian Open, but it seemed like a flight of fancy. Collins had lost in the first round of the three majors she played last year, and it made little sense for a relative to travel 10,000 miles to see what might be only one match.","But Chisholm continued monitoring airfares after each of Collins’s first three matches in Melbourne, all victories. Then, in the fourth round, the unseeded Collins defeated Angelique Kerber, the 2016 champion and this year’s No. 2 seed.","It was just past 11 on Saturday night in Grand Rapids, Minn., when Collins sealed the upset, and Chisholm’s inner voice, which had been nagging her for a week to hop on a plane, grew so loud she could hardly sleep.","On Sunday morning, Chisholm reached out to Collins and said she was looking at flights to Australia. Chisholm didn’t want her arrival to surprise Collins in case, she said, it “messed up her mojo.”","After Collins reacted enthusiastically, Chisholm, who has four children, asked her husband and her mother if they would watch over things at home if she went away for a few days. Then she called a Delta Air Lines reservation agent, who pieced together a trip from Minneapolis to San Diego, then on to Los Angeles that would deliver her to Melbourne on Tuesday morning.","Chisholm had about five minutes to pack for her journey to the Southern Hemisphere, not enough time to retrieve summer clothes from storage. So she threw some shirts and pants into a suitcase, and when her family left for church, she left for Australia.","The trip went off without a hitch, and a few hours after landing here in Melbourne, Chisholm was in Collins’s player box at Rod Laver Arena, transmitting positive vibes down to the court during Collins’s 2-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.","With the victory, Collins, 25, earned a semifinal meeting against Petra Kvitova, the eighth seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion, who recently beat Collins in three sets in the first round of a tuneup event in Brisbane.","“I feel like I’m representing the whole family,” Chisholm said.","In St. Petersburg, Fla., Cathy Collins, a preschool teacher, managed a few hours’ sleep before her alarm went off a little after midnight, in time for her to watch television coverage of her daughter’s match. Collins’s father, Walter, a landscaper, waited until after the match to sleep, taking what amounted to a power nap before starting work.",The house where her parents live is the only place Collins has called home. Some of the neighbors have known her since she was born. A couple that lives across the street has been running over to celebrate every win with Collins’s parents.,"“When the doorbell rings in the middle of the night, we know who it is,” Cathy Collins said by telephone.","It was a quarter to 8 on Tuesday morning, and Collins’s mother would soon be corralling more than a dozen preschoolers. She had gone back to bed when her daughter’s match was over, and woke up wondering if the victory had been a Technicolor dream.","“It’s weird,” Cathy Collins said. “It’s like, ‘Is my daughter really in the semifinals?’”","On the other side of the world, Collins described her father as “the hardest worker I know” and marveled at her mother’s stamina.","“I don’t know how my mom is managing,” Collins said. “She’s not getting more than four or five hours of sleep on these match nights, and she’s dealing with 15 3-year-olds. She’s a trooper.”","So is Collins, who was ranked 35th in the world coming into this tournament with an 0-5 record in Grand Slam matches. She seems unfazed.","At Collins’s post-match news conference Tuesday, a longtime tennis journalist from Europe began a question by saying: “I hope you understand that we are used to meeting players when they’re kids. You are different from our point of view.”","He went on to compliment her maturity, which Collins attributes to a route less taken. Her family couldn’t afford the elite academies and junior circuits that mold small children into young professionals, so she went to college on an athletic scholarship to get her seasoning.","She started at the University of Florida, then transferred to the University of Virginia. Collins won two N.C.A.A. singles titles while earning a degree in media studies and making lifelong friends, many of them non-athletes.","“I think not being a child prodigy, not being a superstar at a young age, certainly humbled me, made me in a way work harder for things,” Collins said, adding, “I think it’s kind of made me hungrier in some ways, like not having that, ‘Oh, I’ve always been really amazing at tennis.’ It wasn’t always like that.”","Collins comes across as feisty — her mother said she’d had “a fighting spirit” since childhood. Collins also oozes confidence, regardless of circumstances.",One of her favorite courses at Virginia was Denise Stewart’s introduction to drama.,"“One of the things she taught us is sometimes you’ve got to go to your job and you’ve got to sit in that cubicle when you don’t want to for eight hours and fake it till you make it,” Collins said. “And so much of life is acting. You’ve got to always have a positive mind-set.”","Stewart said she was not surprised that Collins had found the big stage. Her success, she said, transcends tennis.","“She is such the right woman at this time to say, ‘Humble is not my jam,’” Stewart said."
Serena Williams Turns Back the Clock in Easy Victory - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams dressed for work on Tuesday as though she were intent on reminding people who she was before she became a wife and mother.","The last time Williams graced Rod Laver Arena, in 2017, she dispatched her older sister Venus in the Australian Open women’s final while in the early stages of her pregnancy. She was unable to defend her title last year because she wasn’t ready to return to the tour after a harrowing medical ordeal during and after childbirth.","In her return, 717 days later, Williams warmed up for her first-round match against Tatjana Maria wearing a short black trench coat. Once she got back to her chair, she peeled off the coat to reveal a muscle-hugging, bright green shorts-and-tank-top set that called to mind the black outfit that Williams wore 17 years ago in a first-round match at the United States Open.","It was a bold fashion statement for the 37-year-old Williams, resurrecting the “Serena-tard,” as she called it, which she first made famous in 2002 when she had one of her most sublime seasons, with victories in the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open, and a 56-5 match record.","Williams’s 6-0, 6-2 victory against Maria, her friend and fellow mother, felt like it took place in 2002. She breezed through the opening set in 18 minutes and won 54 points to Maria’s 24. Williams, the No. 16 seed, produced 22 winners.","“I knew that I’ve been working really, really hard in the off-season to be incredibly fit,” said Williams, who can equal Margaret Court’s record 24 Grand Slam singles titles with a victory here.","Maria said she hopes that Williams succeeds. “I have a lot of respect for her for what she’s done in the sport,” she said. “Maybe I was a little bit overwhelmed.”","Maria and Williams live near each other in Florida and occasionally get together for barbecues, Maria said, but she did not feel comfortable on the Australian Open’s main showcourt, which is like a second home to Williams, a seven-time champion. “At the beginning, I didn’t find my rhythm,” Maria said.","Williams eschewed interviews and kept a low profile in the lead-up to this tournament, her first since her unsettling defeat in the United States Open final last fall, where her outburst toward the chair umpire led to her being penalized a game and fined $17,000. While Williams and Maria warmed up before the match, the D.J. played snippets of songs that included Joan Jett’s “Bad Reputation.” If it was an attempt to get a rise out of Williams, she didn’t engage.","She spoke afterward about her dual focus — on tennis when she’s on the court and on her 16-month-old daughter, Alexis Olympia, when she’s not.","“Spending a lot of time with my daughter is a priority for me,” Williams said. “As a working mom I feel guilty. I understand that’s normal. These are years I’ll never get back.”","Williams can’t get the time back that she took off from tennis after having a child. The best she can do is win the Australian Open title that she couldn’t defend last year, and to that end, she got off to a fast start."
Christian Garin Wins US Men's Clay Court Championship - The New York Times,"HOUSTON — Christian Garin of Chile won the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Sunday for his first ATP World Tour title, beating Casper Ruud of Norway 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3 at River Oaks Country Club.","Nearly six years after winning the French Open Juniors title, the 22-year-old Garin finally broke through on the tour, spoiling Ruud's bid to become the first Norwegian winner.","""Casper's a really solid player,"" Garin said. ""His forehand is getting better every day. It was a really intense match. What I did well today was to keep playing my game, every game of the match. I think I am playing my best tennis right now.""","Garin got the decisive service break for a 4-2 third-set lead when, ripping a blistering forehand approach shot, he coaxed Ruud into popping up a backhand volley he easily put away. Garin then easily served out in cool and breezy, but sunny conditions.","""I'm disappointed because it was a very close match and one break in the last set went his way,"" Ruud said. ""I had some chances at 2-all. I tried to stay aggressive and play my game. I made a couple of unforced errors, but I can't be too disappointed because I went for winners and it was a great match overall.""",Garin will crack the top 50 in the world ranking for the first time.
"Rafael Nadal Exits, Giving Roger Federer a Day Off and a Final With Dominic Thiem - The New York Times","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — The undercard became the main event at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Saturday.","The crowd arrived eager to watch Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal renew their rivalry, a few fans having paid dearly to secure a final-hour ticket to Stadium 1.","But Nadal, having tendinitis in his right knee, soon announced his withdrawal after testing the knee in a morning training session.","The only men’s semifinal to be played on Saturday at the BNP Paribas Open was between Dominic Thiem and Milos Raonic, and Thiem prevailed, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (3), 6-4, in a match of contrasting styles in which there was only one break of serve.","That came at 2-2 in the third set when Thiem finally found a window of opportunity against Raonic’s huge serve (and improved volleying). Raonic struck a forehand into the net while facing break point, and Thiem took it from there despite playing a relatively shaky final game in which he had to save the only break point he faced all afternoon.","It will be Thiem versus Federer in Sunday’s final. It will be the ninth final here in the desert for the fourth-seeded Federer, who has won the title five times but lost last year’s final after squandering three match points against Juan Martín del Potro.","It will be the first final at Indian Wells for the seventh-seeded Thiem, and it could be quite an eye-catching duel given each man’s flashy style and their 2-2 head-to-head record.","But it will not generate the same sort of anticipation as a Federer-Nadal rematch. They have not faced each other in 17 months, and this would have been their 39th meeting in singles. But Nadal, who has had patellar tendinitis for years, felt fresh pain in the late stages of his quarterfinal victory over Karen Khachanov on Friday.","Late on Saturday morning, Nadal texted his friendly rival Federer to let him know that he would not be able to play.","“For me, it’s not about only today,” Nadal said. “It’s about what it means for me to have to pull out in a tournament that I love so much like this one, and in the semifinals after playing well during the whole tournament. You can imagine that I can’t be happy.”","Nadal also announced his withdrawal from the Miami Open, which begins next week and is one of the few significant events he has not won. His decision not to play on Saturday was also made with the goal of preserving his clay-court season. An 11-time French Open singles champion and the most successful clay-court player ever, Nadal said he fully expected to be ready to play on clay in Monte Carlo next month.","Federer, 37, appeared in the stadium after the Thiem-Raonic match to give an on-court interview for the fans. Nadal leads their rivalry, 23-15, but Federer has won five straight, most recently in the final of the Shanghai Masters in 2017.","“We’ve had so many epic battles, and yes, I know that everyone we have now could be our last,” Federer said. “So was this our chance for the last one? I really hope not, and I really believe at the level he’s playing and I’m still going, there are definitely going to be more.”"
"Far From Serbia, Novak Djokovic Delivers Some National Pride - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Novak Djokovic, the men’s world No. 1 from Serbia, has been lifting up people from his homeland for years, but not usually like this. At the end of a practice session during last year’s Australian Open, Djokovic walked over to a waist-high fence where fans were packed 10-deep to watch him and hoisted a boy from the front of the crowd over the barricade and onto the court.","That boy, 8-year-old Novak Pokrajac, then got to play a few points with the man for whom he was named, including a 29-shot rally that ended with him hitting an overhead smash past Djokovic for a winner.","Both Novaks are back at Melbourne Park this year — Djokovic, 31, is seeking his seventh Australian Open title and 15th Grand Slam trophy, and Pokrajac, 9, is hoping to entice Djokovic into a practice-court rematch.","For the tens of thousands of Australians of Serbian descent, Djokovic is the secular saint of sport, worshiped by Serbs who still feel an acute sense of persecution nearly two decades after the worst of the Balkans’ fractious ethnic violence. That was evident on Wednesday afternoon, when Djokovic hit with the Australian teenager Alexei Popyrin in front of a crowd that included about a dozen fans flying the red, blue and white colors of the Serbian flag. ","Even during the 50 weeks of the year when the Melbourne Park courts go quiet, Djokovic’s presence looms. In the office off the Serbian Voice, a weekly newspaper on the western edge of Melbourne, one wall serves as a shrine to celebrated Serbian figures from history: Serbian Orthodox Church figures; Vuk Karadzic, the creator of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet; Nikola Tesla, the Serbian-American inventor; and Djokovic. ","For Serbia, a nation of seven million people, it is “a big deal” to be able to claim the top-ranked player in men’s tennis — and one of the best ever — said Zeljko Prodanovic, the newspaper’s editor.","“After the war, it’s not so easy to say, ‘Here we are,’” he said. “You look at the movies, Serbs are always the bad guys. But now we can say we have the best tennis player in the world. That makes us proud.”","The newspaper’s owner, Zivana Jovanovic, has welcomed several Serbian luminaries to her office in her two decades at the helm, including the actor Dragan Nikolic and the retired N.B.A. player Vlade Divac. She has never met Djokovic but said she felt as if she knows him because of his high profile. For all his fame, Jovanovic said, Djokovic comes across as humble. ","“I like that about him,” she said. “He hasn’t let all his success go to his head.”","Djokovic’s celebrity status has made it hard for him to move freely in public in Melbourne, but in his younger days he had regular haunts: a church where he would ring in the Orthodox New Year, or the restaurants on Lygon Street, known for its outdoor cafes and European eateries. Now, though, when Djokovic ventures out into the city, as he did before the tournament for a photo opportunity for one of his sponsors, he is swarmed by admirers.","Still, Djokovic said he tries to meet and chat with Serbs wherever he goes and invite them to watch him play.","“I guess it nurtures the culture and tradition,” he said. “Me as one of the athletes from our country that is internationally successful, I feel there is also a responsibility to represent the country in a right way. For a lot of those people, especially who live here, they have not seen or been to Serbia for a long time. So for them it’s quite a treat to have me playing here and other tennis players from Serbia.”","Michael Popovic, a middle-aged Serb who emigrated from Belgrade to Melbourne in his 20s, was at Rod Laver Arena in 2008 when Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the semifinals to reach the final, where he would defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for his first major title. ","“The feeling I had at that moment was very hard to describe,” said Popovic, a restaurateur. “It was like I just won.”","Popovic owns Mediterraneo, a restaurant on a quiet street in an upscale neighborhood south of the city center that specializes in steak and seafood. The restaurant also offers vegan and gluten-free dishes — “Because of Novak,” Popovic said, referring to Djokovic’s decision several years ago to overhaul his diet.","“I serve Serbian burgers with no bread crumbs,” Popovic added. “That was Novak’s influence, also.”","But the only Djokovic whom Popovic has served is Novak’s uncle Goran. “Somehow I’ve never had the pleasure of having Novak here,” he said.","That nearly changed last weekend, when a large party of Serbs — including the pro Janko Tipsarevic, who every year distributes tournament tickets to the local Serbian community through one of his friends — stopped in for dinner. Djokovic was supposed to join them, but long after they had been seated, they received a text from him saying they should eat without him because he was stuck in meetings related to his responsibilities as the president of the ATP Player Council.","“It was a pity,” Popovic said. “I was really hoping he would come.”","On Monday, Pokrajac, the young fan, made sure he wouldn’t miss Djokovic, arriving at Melbourne Park with his mother, Snezana, more than an hour before the player was scheduled to practice. He wanted to claim a prime viewing spot, up against the fence again. The night before, Pokrajac said, he had imagined getting to hit again with Djokovic, borrowing a technique that has served him well in his matches.","“If I visualize something before,” Pokrajac said, “then it will happen.”","After Djokovic finished practicing, Pokrajac shouted, “Remember me, Novak? I’m here from Perth.”","Djokovic remembered. He came over, hoisted Pokrajac over the fence again, handed him a racket, and they began to hit. They played four “points.” The second rally was 34 shots; the fourth ended on the 16th, when Pokrajac hit a half-volley for a winner.","His prize was a hug and a signed T-shirt from Djokovic, who also offered a tip on how to return a slice.","“He told me to get lower,” Pokrajac said.","Two days later, Pokrajac staked out his same spot. He unfurled a Serbian flag that he had signed and which he intended to present to Djokovic as a parting gift. After his session, Djokovic came over and accepted the flag. He read what Pokrajac had written: “To Novak from Novak from Perth.” Under his signature Pokrajac had written, “It’s going to be worth gold money” and added a smiley face.","Djokovic hugged him. As Pokrajac turned to rejoin his mother, his smile was incandescent.","“I feel like I know him,” Pokrajac said. “I think we’re going to be friends now.”",Ben Rothenberg contributed reporting. 
"Acknowledging Distractions, Novak Djokovic Loses at Miami Open - The New York Times","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — In what is usually one of his most successful stretches of the season, top-ranked Novak Djokovic fell short of expectations for the second time this month, losing, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, to No. 22 Roberto Bautista Agut in the fourth round of the Miami Open on Tuesday afternoon.","After gaining a foothold in the match early in the second set, Bautista Agut endured a 40-minute rain delay before drawing level. After breaking for a 3-1 advantage, Bautista Agut dropped his serve but then broke Djokovic again immediately, extending his lead to 5-2 before the two traded holds to finish the match.","“The key of the match was at the beginning of the second set, no?” Bautista Agut said. “If I wanted to win the match, I had to be very close at the score. Otherwise Novak, when he gets an advantage, he plays really aggressive.”","Indeed, Djokovic had never previously lost a match at the Miami Open after winning the first set, a string of 41 matches.","His advantage looked even more secure when he broke Bautista Agut in the first game of the second set, but Djokovic could not hold in the next game.","“I lost the momentum,” Djokovic said. “I lost the rhythm in the second set. I gave him a little room to step in, and he did. A little hope that he can come back, and he made a great comeback. But fault is on me, for sure. I had way too many opportunities that I wasted.”","Djokovic, a six-time champion in Miami, came into the tournament with little momentum, having lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round at Indian Wells, a tournament where he is a five-time champion.","The stumbles have come unexpectedly for Djokovic, who had appeared untouchable as he finished his run to a seventh Australian Open title in January, finishing off the major with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over Rafael Nadal in the final.","Djokovic’s inability to dominate has been consistent with the parity on tour this season: The 19 ATP tournaments this season have each been won by a different man. While Djokovic is still a clear leader of the pack in the rankings, his leadership role off the court has perhaps hampered that status.","Djokovic, the president of the ATP player council, has spent these tournaments embroiled in a back room imbroglio over the ATP board’s contentious decision not to renew the contract of the chief executive, Chris Kermode.","Though Djokovic initially refuted a suggestion that those things had disrupted his play, he ultimately conceded that the distractions had been detrimental.","“I just had way too many things off the court,” Djokovic said. “I guess that affected me a little bit on the court.”","It was Bautista Agut’s third win over Djokovic in 10 matches. He also defeated him in their most recent meeting in January, in the semifinals of the ATP tournament in Doha, Qatar.","Bautista Agut converted 4 of 7 break point opportunities on Tuesday, compared with 4 of 13 for Djokovic.","“This kind of match I should not have lost,” Djokovic said. “So many opportunities. Just way too many wasted opportunities.”","ISNER ADVANCES; KYRGIOS LOSES The defending champion John Isner reached the Miami Open quarterfinals with a 7-6(5), 7-6(3) win over Britain’s Kyle Edmund on Tuesday, while Nick Kyrgios, in a loss to Brona Coric, was given a point penalty for an audible obscenity.","The obscenity by Kyrgios, who produced perhaps the shot of the tournament early in his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 loss to the 11th-seeded Coric, was apparently directed at a spectator. The penalty put him down a double break in the third set.","Up next for Coric will be a clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who beat No. 17 Nikoloz Basilashvili, 7-6(4) 6-4, to become the first qualifier to reach the last eight in Miami since Guillermo Canas in 2007. Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, also became the first player born in the 2000s to reach a Masters quarterfinal.","Isner, known for his serve, fired 17 aces and won 81 percent of his first-serve points to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set through three matches in Miami.

Naomi Osaka Splits With Coach After Rising to No. 1 Ranking - The New York Times,"Naomi Osaka, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, announced on Monday that she was splitting with her coach, Sascha Bajin, abruptly ending one of the most successful recent partnerships in women’s tennis at what seemed to be a high point.","The surprising announcement came just 16 days after Osaka won the Australian Open, her second major title under Bajin’s watch. The win vaulted her to the No. 1 ranking, a first for an Asian player on the men’s or women’s singles tours.","Bajin, who became a coach after serving as the longtime hitting partner of Serena Williams, was named the WTA’s Coach of the Year in 2018. He responded on Twitter to Osaka’s announcement.","Osaka, 21, was ranked 68th when she hired Bajin in the lead-up to the 2018 season, giving him his first head coaching role. She quickly surged under his guidance, reaching the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time at the 2018 Australian Open, and then winning her first professional singles title at Indian Wells, Calif., in March.","Osaka beat Williams, her idol, for the first time in her next match in the first round of the Miami Open, and then memorably beat her again six months later in the final of the U.S. Open, a victory which took her into the top-10 for the first time.","The reasons for the split were unclear. Bajin did not respond to messages seeking comment, and Osaka’s agent, Stuart Duguid, declined to comment.","Osaka’s split from Bajin is the latest on a coaches’ carousel in which success has not guaranteed longevity in player-coach partnerships. Last year’s French Open champion, Simona Halep, and the Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, parted with their coaches at the end of last season, meaning that the reigning champions of the past four Grand Slam events are no longer with the coaches who helped them to those titles.","Halep, ranked third, is now working with Thierry Van Cleemput, who split with his longtime charge David Goffin at the Australian Open.","Osaka, who has not yet named a successor to Bajin, will play her first match as WTA No. 1 next week in Dubai. It will be her first time as the No. 1 seed at any WTA event.","Asked after the Australian Open final what advice Bajin had given her before the match, Osaka smiled and said she hadn’t talked to him.","“Yeah, no, like we haven’t really been talking, to be honest, like before any of my matches here,” Osaka said. “He would tell me, like, one thing, then I would be, like, ‘O.K.’ That was it.”"
Miami Open: Osaka Stunned; Williams Withdraws; Federer Holds On - The New York Times,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — In a short stretch of Saturday afternoon, the Miami Open lost two of its biggest attractions — and just held on to a third. Top-ranked Naomi Osaka lost her third-round match, 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-3 to 27th-seeded Hsieh Su-wei. Midway through Osaka’s match, Serena Williams, an eight-time tournament champion, unexpectedly withdrew, citing a left knee injury.","Osaka, who had emerged as the sport’s best front-runner, had won 63 straight matches when winning the first set, dating to 2016. Osaka also led early in the third set, 2-0, before Hsieh leveled and then took a 4-3 lead she did not let go. Hsieh, a crafty 33-year-old veteran, closed out the victory on her first match point, hitting an overhead smash that Osaka blocked back, and then finishing off the point with an unreturnable slice volley.","Osaka had beaten Hsieh earlier this year in the third round of the Australian Open, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1. Hsieh has used her unorthodox game of jabs and feints to establish a reputation as a giant killer; she knocked then-No. 1 Simona Halep out of the third round of Wimbledon last year.","”It’s always great to pick up a better level during the match,” Hsieh said in her on-court interview. “Every time you’ve made it and you beat a good player, you feel, ‘Wow, this is everything. This is so amazing, and I’ve made it.’”","Osaka, in her typically introspective way, admitted that she had “overestimated” herself in several ways, like thinking she could afford to turn her intensity on and off during matches and judging how well she has been handing the pressure of holding the No. 1 ranking.","“I thought I was doing fine with that, but I guess I’m not,” said Osaka, who has a 3-3 record since assuming the top spot, which she may lose depending on the results of other top players in this event. “I think more about winning now.”","The 10th-seeded Williams, who last won the Miami Open in 2015, was to face 18th-seeded Wang Qiang in a third-round match Sunday. Wang receives a walkover into the fourth round, where she will await the winner between Wang Yafan and 25th-seeded Danielle Collins.","It was the third consecutive tournament in which Williams’s body let her down before her racket did. Williams, 37, was forced to retire midway through her second match in Indian Wells, Calif., earlier this month because of a viral illness. In the Australian Open quarterfinals in January, Williams was leading Karolina Pliskova, 5-1, in the third set when she twisted her ankle on match point. Though she had more match point opportunities, the injury particularly encumbered Williams’s serve, causing her to lose all 10 subsequent points in her service games.","After receiving a bye in the first round of the Miami Open, Williams survived an up-and-down second-round match against 63rd-ranked Rebecca Peterson on Friday afternoon. She had not appeared encumbered by her knee, though she did struggle with blinding glare that shone on her side of the court for part of the match, through gaps at Hard Rock Stadium which is hosting tennis for the first time. Williams survived with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 victory but was not happy with her performance.","“I need to just move on and really focus on playing better — or not be in the tournament much longer,” Williams said in her postmatch news conference.","Osaka will next play at the WTA tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, in April, but where Williams will play next is unclear. The next mandatory WTA event for top players is the Madrid Open in May, though Williams has not played there since 2015. Williams did not play any clay court tournaments before the French Open last year, as she focused on improving her conditioning and losing weight she had gained during and after her pregnancy.","That sort of selectivity in scheduling, long a staple of Williams’s career, has increased in recent years, when she has focused more and more on Grand Slam events.","In the men’s draw, Roger Federer avoided being a third high-profile casualty at the tournament on Saturday when he rallied to beat Radu Albot of Moldova, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. Federer, 37, acknowledged some fuzziness on his tactics against Albot, who won the nearby Delray Beach ATP tournament last month.","“He seemed very clear to me, and I wasn’t,” Federer said. “In the heat of the moment, I started forgetting stuff also that my coach told me.”"
"Rafael Nadal Holds Off One Young Challenger, and Prepares to Meet Another - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — Early in his quarterfinal match at the Australian Open on Tuesday, Frances Tiafoe, part of a new generation of male stars who have emerged for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament, faced a break point against his battle-tested opponent.","But Rafael Nadal, of course, is not just any opponent. He is the No. 2 seed, a champion in Melbourne in 2009, the owner of 17 Grand Slam titles and as punishing a player as ever at age 32.","Nadal’s return of serve came back powerfully, pushing the 21-year-old Tiafoe far to his backhand side for a meager reply. And with that, Nadal, as he did during the entire span of a vintage and coldly efficient victory, had put his opponent on an energy-sapping, confidence-draining string.","The exchange ended, mercifully, with a booming Nadal down-the-line forehand, which the powerfully built Tiafoe sent meekly into the net.","Two games into a much-anticipated fight, Tiafoe’s serve had been broken, his fighting spirit dealt a severe blow.","After winning that first break point, Nadal never looked back. Roughly 90 minutes later, the scoreboard flashed the result: 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.","Earlier, another rising star had done what Tiafoe could not, beating his elder to reach the semifinals. Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old from Greece, defeated the 30-year-old Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2), several hours before Nadal and Tiafoe took the court.","But with Nadal’s win at Rod Laver Arena, a measure of order was restored by a member of the old guard.","Buoyant on court after the match, Nadal told the crowd that he had recently joked that the tour’s young challengers could wait awhile before challenging for tennis supremacy.","“But looks that they don’t want to wait,” he said. “They are there, no?”","In this tournament, Nadal has also beaten Alex de Minaur, the 19-year-old new hope of Australia. In the semifinals on Thursday, he will play Tsitsipas.","Tsitsipas, seeded 14th and the first Greek player to make a serious dent in the pro game, is among the clutch of college-age players heralded by the ATP Tour as eventual successors to the four aging kings of the sport: Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray, who have won virtually every Grand Slam singles title since 2003.","They will not be able to defy time forever. Case in point: Murray, the three-time major champion, a former No. 1 and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, announced at the start of this tournament that his days as a player may end at this year’s Wimbledon, if not sooner.","“It feels like a fairytale,” Tsitsipas said in a post-match interview.","As he spoke, inside the stadium and out, rowdy fans, many from Melbourne’s large Greek population, chanted songs and danced — as they have all tournament long.","With his flowing locks and scythe-like, one-handed backhand, Tsitsipas had proved himself a legitimate threat to win here when he blunted Federer on center stage Sunday night.","The upset “got people’s attention,” he said. “My biggest challenge was to stay concentrated, stay focused” in order to prove the win over Federer was no fluke.","Tiafoe — known as “Big Foe,” and one of the few black players on tour — could not come close to duplicating Tsitsipas’s effort. Before playing Nadal, the young American seemed to be playing with the form and confidence that would give him a chance for a monumental upset of his own. He had scored three straight surprising wins against higher-ranked players, including one over the No. 5 seed, Kevin Anderson. He had also gained an avid following with his vivacious on-court persona and post-match celebrations — taking off his shirt and pounding his chest, mimicking his favorite N.B.A. players.",His hope against Nadal was that his young legs would push him past a champion who has won 80 tour titles in a career of nearly two decades.,"Add to that: Maybe, just maybe, Nadal would break down on the unforgiving hard court, a surface that has taken a toll on his body.","After all, Nadal completed just one hard court event last year. At the Australian Open, he retired during the fifth set of his quarterfinal against Marin Cilic, because of an upper leg injury. At the United States Open in September, he retired again, this time because of a knee injury during a semifinal against Juan Martín del Potro.","Nadal took the rest of the year off and had ankle surgery. Then, after he arrived in Australia, he withdrew from a warm-up event in Brisbane because of a left thigh injury.","But at Melbourne Park this year, he looks refreshed. His movement is fluid. His ball striking has looked as crisp and powerful as ever.","Tiafoe spoke to this, offering a view of what it’s like from the distressed other side of the court.","“I knew he was going to bring crazy intensity,” Tiafoe said. “I knew the ball was going to be jumping.","“I knew if he got hold of a forehand, it was going to be barbecue chicken,” he continued, resorting to a culinary metaphor to describe how he felt after just a few points: cooked.","Keenly aware of how small the margins between winning and losing are at this level, Nadal slightly altered his service motion during the off-season. He cut down on his backswing to gain more efficient power. He said after Tuesday’s match that he had also worked on finishing points earlier than usual, to reduce the wear on his body.","There is still much tennis to be played in this tournament. Novak Djokovic, the firmly entrenched No. 1 player, remains on the other side of the draw. He and Nadal could meet in the final here for the second time, a rematch of 2012, when Djokovic won in a nearly six-hour marathon.","But first things first, and for Nadal that means facing Tsitsipas, another chance for the old guard to keep a youthful challenger at bay."
It’s No. 1 vs. the One and Only as Halep Gets Set to Play Serena Williams - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Top-ranked Simona Halep expressed relief and satisfaction after her third-round victory over Venus Williams on Saturday night at the Australian Open. She also remained galvanized for the task ahead — a fourth-round match on Monday against Venus’s sister, Serena.","“It’s always a big challenge to play against the Williams sisters,” Halep said in her on-court interview after her 6-2, 6-3 victory over Venus. “So I was super-motivated today.” As she will have to be on Monday.","“Definitely is the toughest draw I’ve ever had,” Halep said.","Though Halep arrived at Melbourne without a victory since August, she has impressed in her first three matches here. “I think she played pretty flawless today,” was the assessment from Venus Williams after the match.","Serena Williams, meanwhile, easily won her third-round match — 6-2, 6-1 over Dayana Yastremska — and then expressed eagerness for the chance to test herself against the No. 1-ranked Halep.","“I honestly would love to face the world No. 1,” said Williams, adding that she hasn’t faced a No. 1 since her return from maternity leave last year. Actually, Williams has actually not faced a No. 1 player in nearly six years — largely because you can’t be across the net from the No. 1 when you are the No. 1.","Williams’s last match against a top-ranked player was against Victoria Azarenka in February 2013 in the Doha final. Though Williams lost that match, she secured the No. 1 ranking by reaching the semifinals of that tournament and she then held onto it for 186 weeks, through the 2016 U.S. Open, when she ceded it to Angelique Kerber.","Despite her two runs to Grand Slam finals last year, Williams has not beaten many high-profile opponents since her return. She is 1-3 against top-10 players in that span, with the lone victory coming last year against Karolina Pliskova in the United States Open quarterfinals.","Still, Williams is considered the player to beat at every tournament she enters. And according to the player who has spent the last 48 weeks atop the rankings, she’s still the best in the world.","“In my opinion, to be No. 1 in the world and to be the best player in the world, it’s a little bit different,” Halep said. “In this moment, I’m No. 1 in the world, so I will take that. I have been there many months, many weeks.","“But for sure she’s the best player in the world because she won so many Grand Slams,” Halep added in reference to Williams, who is a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. “She’s been a lot on No. 1. I cannot compare my results to her. But in this moment, I am confident that I am in this position, and I’m positive about it.”","Monday’s blockbuster match is a product of a draw that has been almost devoid of major upsets, with seven of the top eight women reaching the fourth round (No. 3 Caroline Wozniacki lost to five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova in the third round).","That steadiness by the favorites represents an abrupt arrival of order to women’s Grand Slam tennis: at Wimbledon last year, only one of the top eight reached the fourth round; at the United States Open, only three did.","Pliskova, the only player seeded in the top 8 to make the second week at the last three Grand Slams, could face the winner of the Halep-Williams match in the quarterfinals. She is looking forward to which of the two it might be.","“For sure, the best match now in the draw,” Pliskova said.","The men have also had a steady ride to the round of 16, with six of the top eight seeded players reaching the second week, including the top four.","But those four all have tough challenges directly ahead of them. The top-seeded player, Novak Djokovic, faces No. 15 Daniil Medvedev, whose ranking has soared from No. 65 since the beginning of last season. Rafael Nadal, who is seeded No. 2, faces resurgent veteran Tomas Berdych, who beat him in straight sets here in 2015, which was their most recent meeting on hard courts.","Roger Federer, seeded No. 3, faces No. 14 Stefanos Tsitsipas, the young Greek who won the ATP’s Next Gen competition in Milan in November. And the player seeded No. 4, Alexander Zverev, faces No. 16 Milos Raonic, who has already knocked out Nick Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka en route to the second week.","Though all dangerous, none of those men face a challenge quite like the one that Serena Williams presents to Halep. Halep is 1-8 against Williams, with her lone win coming via a 6-0, 6-2 blitz in the round-robin stage of the 2014 WTA championships in Singapore. Williams avenged that loss, 6-3, 6-0, in the final days later.","Halep said she would be used to the pressure of facing Williams when they meet here on Monday and hoped she would able to play the same sort of assertive, proactive tennis she deployed against Venus.","“I’m in a good position,” she said. “I feel confident. I played very well today. But doesn’t mean it’s going to be the same against her. I will wait. I will focus on myself — it’s the most important thing.”","And Halep, who has kept a markedly positive attitude throughout the tournament, said there would be something positive resulting from the match, regardless of the outcome. “It’s always great to play against Serena,” she said. “Because every time, I have something to learn.”"
"Taylor Fritz Loses, but Learns, Against Roger Federer - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — This is a story about Roger Federer’s third-round match. Only it is not about Roger Federer.","It is about a young upstart on the men’s tennis tour, a lanky power-hitting Californian who possesses skill and promise and a résumé stacked with solid but not spectacular results.","At Rod Laver Arena this Friday afternoon, the education of Taylor Fritz took a significant, though bruising, step forward. This was a graduate level course held in front of 15,000 fans, taught with calculating precision by a 37-year-old Swiss who has won 20 Grand Slam titles.","“Yes, a real lesson,” Fritz said, once the match was done. “I’m going to be better because of this match, I’ll tell you that.”","Fritz, who is 21 and considered to be one of the most promising players in the game, had come to this Australian Open match on the heels of the biggest Grand Slam victory of his career: a tense, hard-fought win over the 30th-seeded Frenchman Gaël Monfils.","After that match, though he was playing as confidently as he ever had, Fritz was cleareyed about his slim chances against an all-time great like Federer. He noted how his only previous meeting with Federer had been a battle that went to the later stage of a tight third set. Then Fritz had crumbled.","This time, though aware of the long odds against him, Fritz vowed to play loose and relaxed. “Have fun,” he said. “Play my game, hit big.” He wanted to soak up the moment, and learn.","At 1 p.m. on a muggy afternoon, Fritz finally took the court at Rod Laver Arena. He had never played there. He smiled tightly. He fidgeted with his brown hair and white headband. His mind raced.","“There were a lot of thoughts going on in my head,” he would explain, noting that he had simultaneously tried to pump himself up and find calm by listening to rap on his headphones as he strode before the fans.","Then the warm-up began. It was impossible to miss the fact that Fritz’s introduction took just a few seconds. When Federer’s followed, crackling over the public address system, it was a condensed version of the Swiss star’s achievements. Even shortened, it took a full minute.","Now the match was on, and it was clear from the beginning that Federer considered Fritz dangerous. He had reason to. In that one and only meeting, in Stuttgart, Germany, in the summer of 2016, Federer had emerged victorious, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Hardly smooth sailing. Federer seemed determined not to let Fritz get that close again.","So, from the start, Federer displayed the fullness of his range. There were sharp angles and booming drives. There were heavily spinning forehands followed by balls that cut flat against the hot air. It was a level of play Federer will need if he is to win this tournament for a third straight time, and a seventh over all.","“It’s been a long time since I have gotten a beat-down like that,” Fritz told me, unspooling the entire experience once it was done. “It didn’t feel great, not at all.”",The first set took 20 minutes. Federer: 6-1.,"In the second set, Fritz fared better. He began using the leverage from his 6-foot-4-inch frame. With Federer serving, Fritz nudged ahead in a key game. Federer responded with a pair of scorching forehand winners and a curveball ace.","“I get any of those points and I have a break point, a chance to break him and a chance to serve for the set,” Fritz said.","There was resignation in his eyes. But also a glint of hope. “Look, with someone as good as Roger, you know that might be the only chance you get,” Fritz said. “I can see now that you have to take it.”","He certainly did soak up the moment. He loved every part of playing in front of a crowd that large. He tried a bit of showmanship, on one point faking as if he was going down the line, then hitting crosscourt. Problem was, Federer caught up to the ball, responded with a fake of his own and hit a winner.",Fritz had been posterized.,"“I tried to play with him,” he said, “and, well, he played me back.”","Then he spoke of his last stand. Of trying to simply survive. “Regroup, hold serve, hold serve,” he said he kept telling himself, like a mantra.","It didn’t work. Everyone could feel it, most notably his opponent. “Federer was rolling,” Fritz said. “I’ve seen it so many times before, on TV. Once he is in front, he smothers you.”","The end was inevitable. The final score: 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.","Next up for Federer is the round of 16, and another dangerous young player: Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old from Greece, part of a group of 23-and-under men making waves in Melbourne. The American Frances Tiafoe, who turns 21 on Sunday, is in the fourth round of a major for the first time after following his upset of fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson with a five-set win over Andreas Seppi on Friday.","Taylor Fritz, meantime, will return to California, itching for more center courts, more Grand Slam tournaments, more matches against the very best. Against Federer, he experienced aspects of tennis that, if copied, will add significantly to his growth. How to disrupt timing. When to use angles. The way pouncing on the slimmest openings can change tone.","“This was such a learning experience for me,” he said. “I plan to take it and get better, get more comfortable in these moments, so I can play the way I know I can play. I plan to use this as a steppingstone.”"
Can Aryna Sabalenka Ride Her Hot Streak to the Australian Open Title? - The New York Times,"After spending 2018 rapidly ascending the global tennis ranks, Aryna Sabalenka decided to spend some of her brief off-season in free fall. So during a winter visit to Dubai, Sabalenka said, she took the opportunity to bungee jump from 41 floors up.","“These three seconds before you jump, it’s like something unbelievable,” Sabalenka, a 20-year-old Belarusian, said in a recent telephone interview. “You want to cry, smile and laugh.”","The daring off-season activity underscored the intensity and cheerfulness that came to define Sabalenka as she burst onto the scene last year, winning her first two WTA titles.","“She’s always very friendly,” said her coach, Dmitry Tursunov. “She likes to be in a good mood.”","She also likes to win, and she has started where she left off after her breakthrough campaign, becoming the first WTA titlist of 2019 by defeating Alison Riske, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, in the final of the tournament in Shenzhen, China, on Saturday.","Now Sabalenka can add one more label: dark horse to win the Australian Open, where she could establish herself not just as an up-and-comer but as one of the sport’s pacesetters.","“I’m telling you here, right now, that the winner of the Australian Open women’s side is going to be Sabalenka, O.K.?” the ESPN analyst Patrick McEnroe told reporters this week. “She’s going to win the Australian Open.”",The title in Shenzhen helped her return to a career-best ranking of No. 11 on the eve of the year’s first Grand Slam tournament. And despite a stumble at her next tournament — a first-round loss to eighth-ranked Petra Kvitova in Sydney — Sabalenka’s recent tear has put her on more than one list of Australian Open favorites.,"“If you look at the top 20 players, especially with her age, she is probably the most dangerous one right now because of the power,” said Sophie Amiach, a former Australian Open quarterfinalist in singles and doubles who is now an analyst for the WTA’s world feed.","“Besides the given, Serena, everybody else, the power is there, but I don’t think it’s as much as what she has,” Amiach added, referring to Serena Williams, who is seeking to equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.","But the overwhelming force that has fueled Sabalenka’s rise can also be difficult to harness at times. Her serves and forehands can misfire by yards, and her shot selection is sometimes questionable. Seesaw matches proved a mainstay for Sabalenka in 2018, leading to a WTA-high 29 third sets contested.",That inconsistency might have been what prompted a bit of criticism from President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus when he met Sabalenka in November.,"“I am happy with your performance,” he was quoted saying by the news agency BeITA, “except for several moments when the ball went out of court while you could keep it in the game.”","But like her fellow rising star Naomi Osaka, 21, Sabalenka has started to rein in her game while still blasting winners. It helped Sabalenka, the only player to take a set off Osaka during her run to the United States Open title last fall, rise to No. 13 by the end of 2018 after beginning the year ranked 73rd. Her eight wins over top-10 players last year — all after June — placed her behind only Kiki Bertens and Elina Svitolina.","And Sabalenka toppled Svitolina, the eventual champion at the WTA Finals in October, on the way to her biggest title, in Wuhan, China, a month earlier.","“She is a quick learner, but I feel also she is a quick learner because she is passionate about it and wants to do it,” said Tursunov, who used a similarly powerful style to win seven ATP titles in his career. “And I think that kind of summarizes her improvement.”","Before he became Sabalenka’s coach during the summer grass-court swing last year, Tursunov had already been impressed by his future charge’s performance and attitude as he observed her on tour.","At last year’s tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., Tursunov looked on as the player he was then coaching, Elena Vesnina, faced Sabalenka and her countrywoman Victoria Azarenka in a doubles match with Ekaterina Makarova. Vesnina and Makarova, the tournament’s top seeds, prevailed, 6-4, 6-3.","“She didn’t get fazed when she was being rifled at,” Tursunov said, “and a few times they were just going at her and knocked her down on her butt. She was kind of sitting and giggling.”","He added: “Those are the things that just kind of stuck in my mind. The way she was handling tough situations, and situations where she was being outplayed.”","Sabalenka attributes some of that mental toughness to her roots in Belarus. Money was scarce, so she did not compete in any junior Grand Slam events and participated in just four tournaments outside Europe.","“I could play tennis, but no one believed in me that much,” Sabalenka said. “Actually I think this kind of thing helped me to improve my game.","“Before, I was actually upset with it. They think I am not the best player, and it made me work extra hard and improve my game.”","It was with the Belarusian Fed Cup team, however, that Sabalenka emerged on the broader scene, in 2017. Belarus advanced to the final, with Sabalenka and Aliaksandra Sasnovich falling to the Americans Shelby Rogers and CoCo Vandeweghe in the deciding doubles match in Minsk.","Even as her ranking climbs and her goals become loftier, Sabalenka said she did not intend to skip the Fed Cup series. Her energy seems to resonate throughout the squad.","“She is always fighting, so when playing on a team with her, you just cannot go down, because you are just getting involved in this flow she creates,” Vera Lapko, her fellow 20-year-old Belarusian, said in an email.",Neither that grit nor the smiles will escape Sabalenka anytime soon.,"“I’m smiling and laughing,” she said. “I don’t want to be too serious because this is not me.”"
Serena Williams Falls to Karolina Pliskova With Late Collapse - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams was one point from the Australian Open semifinals when she lost her footing and the match slipped away.","Williams, who was seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, lost the final six games to fall, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, to Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday, relinquishing her lead after rolling her left ankle when the match was within her reach.","“I was almost in the locker room, but now I’m standing here as a winner,” Pliskova said in her on-court interview after the match. “So it’s a really good feeling.”","Williams, known more for improbable comebacks than collapses, had not lost a Grand Slam match after holding a match point since the 2010 French Open.","Pliskova, the No. 7 seed, will face the fourth-seeded Naomi Osaka in the semifinals on Thursday. The other semifinal pits the eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova against the unseeded American Danielle Collins.","This was Williams’s fourth major tournament since resuming her career in 2018 after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September 2017. Williams withdrew before the fourth round of last year’s French Open because of an injury and lost in two other Grand Slam finals — to Anqelique Kerber at Wimbledon and to Osaka at the United States Open in a match remembered primarily for Williams’s confrontation with the chair umpire, which cost her a game penalty.","Williams, who dispatched the top-seeded Simona Halep in a hard-fought, fourth-round match, has not defeated two top-10 players at the same event since returning from her pregnancy. She has spoken candidly about her struggles to return to peak physical condition after giving birth, and she arrived here looking fitter than she had since before her pregnancy.","Williams, 37, has not reached for excuses, even when she has struggled in ways she had not before leaving the tour to become a mother.","“From Day 1, I expect to go out and, quite frankly, to win,” Williams said. “That hasn’t happened. But I do like my attitude. I like that I don’t want to go out here and say, ‘I expect to lose because I had a year off, I’ve been playing for 10 months, I’m not supposed to win.’ I don’t have that attitude.”","While Williams’s mind-set has been positive, on Wednesday her body betrayed her and the match suddenly pivoted in Pliskova’s favor.","Her match turned in an instant. With a commanding 5-1 lead in the third set, the 16th-seeded Williams held a match point on her serve, at 40-30. But after she was called for a foot fault on her first serve, Williams appeared to sustain an injury in the rally that began off her second serve, rolling her left ankle as she tried to change directions to reach a shot from Pliskova.","Williams lost the point, and then the next two points. She did not call a medical timeout on the ensuing changeover, but she retied her shoelaces, making them tighter.","“I really hate calling the trainer out, to be honest,” she said. “And at that point I didn’t feel like I needed it or I didn’t feel like it would be a big deal. So I just kept going.”","But the tighter shoes did not keep her in the match. Pliskova won the next two games, pulling to 4-5, suddenly back on serve. Williams earned three more match points in the 10th game, but Pliskova saved them all.","“I thought, ‘All right, here we go, you’re going to win one of these,’” Williams said. “That clearly didn’t happen, but I was just trying at that point.”","Pliskova held on to make it 5-5 with a backhand cross-court winner, punctuated with a loud and long scream.","“Then, suddenly, I got a chance too,” Pliskova said of her improbable victory after facing four match points. “That’s how it is in tennis. You need luck, of course, because this is — I think — not happening often. Maybe once in life. But I went for it.”","Williams, who like all right-handers lands on her left foot when she serves, lost all 10 remaining points on her serve after the injury. While she said she would not know how bad her ankle injury was until a day later, she played down the effect of the injury on the outcome of the match, repeatedly giving Pliskova credit for playing “lights out” tennis as she surged back.","“I think she just played well on my serve after that point,” Williams said. “I think she just kind of started playing really, really good. I don’t think it had anything to do with my ankle, per se. I just think she was just nailing and hitting shots. Obviously I made some mistakes, but she played really well after that.”","Pliskova said she thought something might have happened to Williams, but that she remained focused on her own side of the court.","“Whatever is happening on the other side, I just try to block it,” Pliskova said. “Either it’s positive or negative, whatever is there, it’s just not my business. I’m sorry, but that’s how it is. I know once I’m starting to think about that, it’s bad.”","Pliskova won the next two games to complete the improbable comeback, winning after Williams hit a forehand into the net for an unforced error on her third match point.","Pliskova, a former No. 1, had knocked Williams out of a Grand Slam event before, beating her in straight sets in the 2016 United States Open semifinals. She had looked on track for a similarly efficient victory when she broke Williams for a 3-2 lead in the second set.","But Williams roared back, breaking Pliskova at love in the next game, beginning a stretch of winning 9 of 11 games and taking complete command of the match before her late collapse.","Pliskova, whose appearance in the 2016 United States Open final was her only previous major title match, has won two of her previous three matches against Osaka. She most recently beat her 6-4, 6-4 in the final of the WTA tournament in Tokyo in September.","Osaka, 21, will be seeking a second straight Grand Slam title. She reached the semifinals with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over the sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina.","Osaka, who had never reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam before her triumph in New York last fall, said she was keeping this accomplishment in perspective.","“To be here is something that a lot of people want, and I know that a few months ago I would have given anything to be in the semifinals of a slam,” Osaka said. “But it’s this weird feeling of: You want to do the next big thing. And especially now that I won a Grand Slam, and I feel like I want to win another one, and I’m so close and I just want to keep going.”","Osaka and Kvitova could each claim the No. 1 ranking for the first time if they win the tournament on Saturday. After pulling herself from the brink of defeat, Pliskova also has a chance to return to the No. 1 ranking with a victory, even if she had begun to count herself out of the tournament when she was one point from defeat.","“My mind was in the locker room,” Pliskova said. “I was still here.”","For Williams, who has the trophy as her goal every time she arrives at a Grand Slam event, her quest to match Margaret Court’s 24 singles Grand Slam titles will resume at the French Open in May.","”I mean, the big picture for me is always winning,” Williams said. “I’m not going to sit here and lie about that. It hasn’t happened yet, but I feel like it’s going to happen. Just keep taking it one match at a time, just keep soldiering on, I guess.”"
Reilly Opelka Continues Rise With First ATP Title at New York Open - The New York Times,"UNIONDALE, N.Y. — The second edition of the New York Open concluded on Sunday with a pair of unexpected players engaging in a tense and memorable final that provided enough excitement to make up for the lack of star power.","The organizers of the event, which moved to Long Island last year after 40 years in Memphis, might have hoped for more marketable names to highlight the tournament’s final days to help lift the profile of the tour stop.","After all, neither Reilly Opelka nor Brayden Schnur were among the seven players featured on the promotional posters used to advertise the tournament’s return to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. But Opelka and Schnur provided plenty of buzz for the 3,128 fans who showed up for the final.","The tension peaked with a nerve-racking replay after a challenge on the 15th point of the third-set tiebreaker. On the next point, Opelka finished off Schnur, 6-1, 6-7 (7), 7-6 (7), for his first ATP Tour-level title.","Opelka, 21, has won challenger tournaments at the lower levels of the professional tour, and he won the juniors title at Wimbledon in 2015. But this was the breakthrough he and many of his supporters had anticipated for some time.","“This is definitely my biggest title yet, the one I’m most proud of, for sure,” Opelka said. “It’s been a lot of years coming.”","It did not come easy. Schnur saved five match points and appeared to have a match point of his own when he served what seemed to be an ace at 7-7 in the tiebreaker of the decisive set. But Opelka challenged the call, and the serve was ruled out by perhaps a millimeter.","Schnur, who had never even won an ATP Tour-level match before arriving in New York (he was 0 for 5), then missed his second serve for a double fault. At 8-7, Opelka ripped an ace out wide to win the match.","“That challenge was probably the difference in the match,” Opelka said.","At 6 feet 11 inches with a booming serve, Opelka is expected to rise to No. 56 from No. 89 when the new rankings come out. Sunday’s result will also bolster his status as a potential heir to John Isner, the current top-ranked American male player, whom Opelka has beaten twice in a row.",Opelka downed the top-seeded Isner in their hard-hitting semifinal encounter Saturday night as the two set a record with 81 combined aces in a three-set match. That was a repeat of Opelka’s surprise victory over the 6-10 Isner in the first round of the Australian Open last month.,"Opelka’s close victory on the black wooden courts at the Coliseum denied Schnur, a 23-year-old from Canada, what would have been an even more improbable victory.","A qualifier with a head cold, Schnur arrived in New York last week without a guaranteed spot in the draw.","He had reached a career-high ranking of 154th leading up to the New York Open, but he nearly didn’t get to play a single point here. He was granted the last alternate spot in the qualifying draw, and he won two matches there to advance to the main draw. There he upset the third-seeded Steve Johnson and the sixth-seeded Sam Querrey as he earned four straight victories to reach the final.","Though generally unknown, Schnur, a former college player at the University of North Carolina who was born in Pickering, Ontario, has one attribute that will endear him to those who want pro tennis to speed up: He does not bounce the ball before serving. Most players bounce it at least a few times, and some, like Rafael Nadal, sometimes bounce it repeatedly, to the chagrin of some opponents and spectators.","Schnur stands at the baseline, waits for his opponent to get into the ready position, and then simply tosses the ball into the air and slams away. He started doing it that way, he said, while playing on the uneven grass at warm-up tournaments ahead of Wimbledon. Schnur said the unpredictable bounces left him scrambling to catch up to the ball and adversely affected his rhythm.",The emotions of the breakthrough week seemed to catch up to Schnur on Sunday as he fought back tears in his postmatch speech to fans and later during his news conference.,"“Only a handful of people know how hard I really worked for this,” he said. “I’m not the most talented guy out on the court.”","Schnur’s and Opelka’s paths to the final were relatively smooth, as the Open’s field of players didn’t include many of the world’s top-ranked individuals. But attendance was up compared with last year, according to Josh Ripple, the tournament director, both over all and for the final; in last year’s final, Kevin Anderson beat Querrey.","“We did better by every metric,” Ripple said, “including attendance and revenue, and 2020 will be the pivotal year for us.”","If Opelka comes back, he probably will make it onto the poster."
"For Caroline Wozniacki, Battling Arthritis Is the New Normal - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — The beginning of a calendar year normally would seem a strange time to be preoccupied with endings. But when Andy Murray tearfully announced his impending retirement because of a deteriorating right hip in a pretournament news conference, the Australian Open underwent a jarring mood swing, from the so-called Happy Slam to a major dominated by talk about pain management and the sometimes extraordinary measures required to prolong careers.","The Hospice Slam, anyone?","The 31-year-old Murray, a three-time major winner, missed the tournament last year because of hip surgery that did not alleviate his suffering. On Monday, he valiantly battled the pain and his opponent, Roberto Bautista Agut, for more than four hours before losing in five sets.","Rafael Nadal, 32, who secured a spot in the second round against Matthew Ebden, described how his crumbling knees and various other injuries have forced him to adjust his practice schedule based on his “body feelings” and to adopt a faster, more aggressive serve to try to shorten points.","The five-time major winner Maria Sharapova, 31, easily dispatched Harriet Dart, then spoke about how the shoulder pain that has plagued her for 10 years forced her to accept the fact that “you’re not immortal; you’re never going to play this forever.”","Then there was Caroline Wozniacki, who is still in her twenties but already managing her own health crisis. Wozniacki, 28, returned to Rod Laver Arena for her first-round match against Alison Van Uytvanck looking outwardly the same as she did when she outlasted Simona Halep on the same stage last year to win her first Grand Slam title.","Wozniacki ran down drop shots and prevailed in most of the rallies of more than nine shots in a 6-3, 6-4 victory that belied the extra effort now required for her to maintain her competitive edge. Last summer Wozniacki learned she had rheumatoid arthritis, a condition linked to immune system dysfunction. As Wozniacki explained it, her immune system attacks healthy tissue in and around the joints of her hands, knees and feet, causing rashes, inflammation and fatigue.","The diagnosis forced Wozniacki to overhaul her routine to include more massages, less (or at least smarter) tennis, more rest, less sugar, more stretching and less jogging.","“You listen to the body, you try different things,” she said, adding: “There are days I wake up and don’t feel great, and when that happens, I’m still going to go out there and do my thing, but I’m going to taper it down. And I know in my head I don’t need to go full-out today and it’s going to make me feel worse tomorrow. I’ve matured a lot. That’s never how I used to think.”","It’s remarkable to hear so many prominent players give voice to their vulnerabilities. As Murray acknowledged, “When you’re going to compete, you want to be positive and optimistic about things because you don’t want to be telling your opponents, the guys you’re competing against, how bad you’re feeling.”","His Friday news conference announcing his retirement, he added, “was kind of the first time I kind of came out and let everyone know how bad it’s been and tough.”","Wozniacki was the same way. She knew before last year’s United States Open that the flulike symptoms that had plagued her all summer were, in fact, signs of something more serious. But she said nothing about her condition for two months, waiting until the news conference after her final match of the season, in Singapore in October, to reveal the diagnosis.","“I didn’t want to give anyone the edge,” Wozniacki said.",She rejected the notion that a full disclosure of her health woes would have benefited her by moderating external expectations.,"“I think because I’m such a competitor, I don’t want anything to be an excuse,” Wozniacki said, adding: “I know myself and what I’ve done out there. I’m either proud of myself for giving it my all, or I can be disappointed because I thought I could do better, but I don’t really need the sympathy.”","Wozniacki followed her Australian Open title with two more victories, in a pre-Wimbledon tuneup at Eastbourne in June and a Premier Mandatory event in Beijing in October — both, she said, while exhibiting one or more of the textbook symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The Beijing win was especially satisfying, Wozniacki said, “because I didn’t know, will I ever be able to play six matches in a row? That really gave me the confidence, you know, if I can do this I can do anything.”","After Wimbledon, where Wozniacki lost in the second round, the rest of her summer passed in a fog of inconclusive doctor visits and inexplicable early-round losses. Wozniacki withdrew from the tournament in Washington because of pain in her knees. In her next tournament, in Montreal, she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in her first match and awoke the next morning unable to lift her arms to brush her teeth. From there, it was on to Cincinnati, where she retired after the first set of her first match because she couldn’t find the energy to soldier on.","Everywhere Wozniacki went, she saw doctors, she said, who proclaimed her fit and sent her away with medication for a head cold or influenza.","“The doctors did blood tests, but they weren’t addressing the inflammation, which was the weird thing,” said Wozniacki, who found it stranger still that after years of wearing opponents down with her fitness, she was the one tiring first in her matches.","From Cincinnati, Wozniacki traveled to New York, where she maintains an apartment, and insisted on undergoing a comprehensive battery of tests, one of which came back positive for rheumatoid arthritis. Wozniacki was relieved finally to have a diagnosis but refrained from reading up on the disease, she said, because she wanted to focus on the United States Open.","After her second-round loss to Lesia Tsurenko, Wozniacki typed “rheumatoid arthritis” into a search engine on her phone during the ride back to her apartment and quickly educated herself on this new and formidable opponent. She made an appointment to see a New York-based rheumatologist, who assuaged her fears.","“She said a lot of people she works with can live a normal life with it,” Wozniacki said.","Of course, Wozniacki’s physically challenging, globe-trotting existence is nobody’s idea of a normal life.","“I asked her: ‘What about my tennis? What about my career?’” Wozniacki said. “And she said, ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to figure it out.’”","In Monday’s match, Wozniacki expressed surprise at Van Uytvanck’s tactic of hitting drop shots from behind the baseline, as if to test her speed and stamina.","But Wozniacki figured it out and hit a few back for winners. “I’m like, ‘Wow, I actually got to them, hit it well, I kind of complimented myself on a couple of them,” she said with a laugh, not bothering to disguise her delight in showing how much life is left in her wheels."
"At Indian Wells, It’ll Be Federer vs. Nadal for the 39th Time. Maybe. - The New York Times","INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — After another day of big serves and topspin forehands in the desert sunshine, just about everyone appeared to get what they wanted: a 39th match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.","The question is, will it actually happen?","Federer, despite being the elder at 37, looks readier to rumble. Between Dubai and Indian Wells, he has won nine straight matches and 15 straight sets and artfully and uneventfully dispatched the unseeded Hubert Hurkacz, 6-4, 6-4, in Friday’s first quarterfinal of the BNP Paribas Open.","But Nadal had to dig much deeper to wriggle free of the firm grip and aggressive game of Karen Khachanov, the brawny young Russian who pushed him hard in the third round of last year’s United States Open.","This time, Nadal prevailed, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), but only after Khachanov stretched him repeatedly with huge serves and whipping forehands and only after Nadal needed on-court treatment and tape for pain in his long-troublesome right knee.","And there lies the problem with planning your day or, depending on the time zone, your night around watching No. 39.","Nadal remains one of the greatest, in-the-moment competitors in any sport, but his recent record in hardcourt tournaments is a downbeat litany of withdrawals, retirements and anticlimaxes.","It remains an open question if he will feel hearty enough to play Saturday afternoon’s semifinal. He does not have a day off to recover. He also has the rest of the 2019 season to consider, including his sacrosanct season within a season on clay that is scheduled to start next month in Monte Carlo.","“Of course my goal and my idea is to be ready for tomorrow,” Nadal said after pursing his lips and shaking his head.",But he also knows from long experience with patellar tendinitis that being ready is no sure thing.,"“I cannot guarantee how I will feel when I wake up tomorrow,” he said. “But the desire to play a match like this against Federer is always very special, and it’s even more special if we’re both at a high level and at 100 percent. Hopefully it will be that way, above all for me but also for the fans on site and for fans in general. I hope I will be able to play aggressively. I need to be ready to react very quickly and to have everything in place to be able to succeed. If not, it will be very difficult.”","Nadal and Federer first played in Miami in 2004, but they have not met since October 2017, when Federer beat Nadal in the final of the Shanghai Masters. Federer went 5-0 against Nadal in 2017, a resurgent season for both men, after upgrading his ability to attack with his single-handed backhand.",That run of success has narrowed the big edge that Nadal once held in their rivalry; he now leads by 23-15.,"“I don’t think those five matches matter that much, to be honest,” Federer said of the 2017 victories. “A lot of time has gone by, unfortunately maybe for the rivalry for us, or for me. It’s always better to keep on maybe playing against him.”","Federer started this season by failing to retain his title at the Australian Open but has responded by going on a roll. After winning his 100th career title in Dubai, Federer is now two victories from his 101st. To get there, he may first have to deal with the man who has been his friendly rival for 15 years and who remains a friend: The two had coffee at Federer’s rented home last week to discuss the state of the tennis world.","“Different styles, different ways to understand the sport,” Nadal said. “And at the same time, two players with a good relationship after all the things that we went through in our careers, competing for the most important things.”","In his first match against Hurkacz, a rangy and powerful 22-year-old from Poland, Federer looked loose from the start as he tested the full range of his skill set.","There was the usual: wickedly sliced backhands, blocked returns and first serve-forehand combination punches. There was also the unusual: chip and charge tactics, serve-and-volley on second serve and no-look flicked backhand overheads.","But it will be hard to be quite so relaxed and experimental against Nadal, whose ability (when healthy) to extend rallies and take command of them with his left-handed, topspin forehand is an entirely different, though much more familiar, challenge.","The two did not play any of the same regular ATP Tour events in 2018, and they did not face off in the three Grand Slam tournaments that they both played: the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open.","Federer was asked if, after all these years, the matchup with Nadal still gave him more of a thrill than facing an unknown rising player.","“I think a combination,” he said. “If it was only Rafa, I wouldn’t enjoy that as well. I think having the mix is the magic really for me. Playing against young guys to eventually get to Rafa, that’s exciting.”","It was quite an achievement for Nadal to get to Federer through the 22-year-old Khachanov. He was visibly hampered by his knee trouble, which first required treatment on court with Khachanov leading by 2-1 in the second set. Visibly slower and unable to push off as powerfully with his legs to serve, he still found a way to grind and win.","“It’s a special victory considering the way I was feeling,” Nadal said.","Playing with pain has unfortunately become close to the rule on hardcourts for Nadal, who has long complained and warned about the physical toll of hardcourt play.","Nadal, 32, conceded that part of the problem was playing more than 1,100 matches in his career, not just playing on hardcourts. But he also pointed out that other sports tended to be played regularly on grass or on other more forgiving surfaces.","“I love to play on hard, but probably my body doesn’t love it that much,” he said. “And my feeling is there are a lot of players that love to play on hard, true, but their bodies don’t love to play on hard, either.”","He is also concerned about the price he and others might pay in retirement. “When I see some old legends walking around the tour,” he said, “it’s tough.”"
Two Women Who Stuck With It Win Aussie Doubles Crown - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — There’s no rewinding the results in sports, as New Orleans fans still fuming about last week’s N.F.C. Championship game can attest. But sometimes, as Sam Stosur proved Friday at the Australian Open, it is possible to get it right the second time.","In 2006, Stosur, a Queenslander playing in the women’s doubles final in her home Grand Slam, lost her service while attempting to close out the match in the second set. Stosur and her doubles partner, Lisa Raymond, squandered two championship points on their way to a three-set defeat to the Chinese team of Yan Zi and Zheng Jie.","Thirteen years later, Stosur was back in the women’s doubles final, this time alongside China’s Zhang Shuai. They were playing the defending champions, Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, and again Stosur was serving in the second set to close out the match.","Stosur earned a championship point, which she squandered with a double fault. But the past doesn’t have to be prologue. On the next point, Stosur produced an overhead winner to end a 25-shot rally. Then she watched the 13th shot of the next point sail long, near her feet, to seal her 6-3, 6-4 victory with Zhang at Rod Laver Arena.","It was sweet redemption for Stosur, not only because of her near miss in 2006 but also because of all her quick exits here in the singles competition. Since defeating Serena Williams in the final to win the 2011 United States Open, Stosur, 34, has exited in the first round in singles in this tournament five times, including the past four years.","Stosur held her head high after her latest opening-round defeat, last week in straight sets to Dayana Yastremska, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, of whom she said, “I think she’s going to be a very good player.”","Stosur, who won the mixed doubles here in 2005 with Scott Draper, immediately turned her attention to the women’s doubles. “I think probably for any singles player, playing doubles can almost feel more relaxing or more fun,” she said.","In Zhang, Stosur found a partner whose wit is as sharp as her net play. She kept Stosur loose — and occasionally made her laugh out loud — with her on-court comments. “If we could transfer that a little bit into the singles court, that would be a good thing,” Stosur said.","Zhang, 30, had exited in the first round in singles in all 14 majors she had played and was contemplating retirement in early 2016 when Stosur sent her a long and passionate text encouraging her to continue playing. Zhang then advanced to the quarterfinals in singles at the 2016 Australian Open as a qualifier — still her best finish in singles in a major — and now, on the strength of Stosur’s powers of persuasion, she can call herself a Grand Slam champion.","“Really important message,” Zhang said, smiling, of Stosur’s long-ago text.","These two weeks, Zhang added, have been the most “amazing in my life.”","Stosur said she had been in communication with Raymond, who told her the other night in a text: “Go get it 13 years later. Get it now.” Stosur said, “That was really nice.”","The stands were roughly half full for the final but wholly behind Stosur and Zhang, ringing the stadium with chants of “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy.”","“You guys definitely are in a good mood right now,” Mladenovic said to the crowd during the on-court trophy presentation. “That was not our goal.”","The walk from the court to the locker room took Stosur and Zhang nearly as long as Stosur’s opening service game, which lasted 10 minutes, because every few steps she was stopped by well-wishers. Tournament workers applauded when Stosur emerged from a media-center elevator, and she received more applause from reporters as soon as she stepped inside the main interview room.","“I think to be able to play at home is super exciting,” Stosur said. “I can feel my phone going off every two seconds at the moment. It’s great to know that the support’s there from everyone that’s close to you, but also feeling it from people you don’t even know who are happy and excited, it’s an amazing feeling.”"
Maria Sharapova Beats Caroline Wozniacki in a Third-Round Grudge Match - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Maria Sharapova walked up to the dais as if she were walking into a bash. She wore a black crop top that fell to her waist and tights that were shimmery and chic.","“I don’t pull those out too often,” she chirped to a roomful of reporters, referring to the top. “I’m really happy.”","Known for her frosty reserve on the court, Sharapova was in a celebratory mood on Friday after dispatching the reigning champion and No. 3 seed, Caroline Wozniacki, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, in a third-round grudge match.","Wozniacki, who is friends with the other women on the tour, and Sharapova, who keeps her competitors at arm’s length, are one-time Australian Open winners and full-time adversaries. Their clashing personalities don’t account for why they approached every point in the 2-hour, 24-minute slugfest as if they were playing for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup instead of a berth in the round of 16.","At this tournament in 2016, Sharapova, the 2008 champion from Russia, tested positive for meldonium, which had been newly added to the sport’s banned substances list. Sharapova, who has steadfastly maintained that she was unaware of the change in the drug’s status, received a two-year ban that later was reduced to 15 months.","When Sharapova returned to competition in 2017, many players, including Wozniacki of Denmark, were critical of her receiving wild cards and other forms of what they considered preferential treatment. That year, the animus between the pair seeped into the United States Open after Sharapova played a second-round match at Arthur Ashe Stadium while the much higher-seeded Wozniacki was relegated on the same day to an outside court, where she lost.","In an interview afterward with a Danish newspaper, Wozniacki questioned putting “someone who comes back from a drugs sentence,” as she worded it, on the main show court. “I think it doesn’t set a good example,” she said.","When Wozniacki’s comments were later relayed to her, Sharapova said it didn’t matter where she played, because all she cared about was that she was still in the tournament. Without mentioning Wozniacki by name, she added, “I’m not sure where she is.”","Friday’s match at Rod Laver Arena was the 11th competitive meeting between Wozniacki and Sharapova, who holds a 7-4 edge. But it was the first time they’d played since Sharapova’s suspension.","“It was definitely, you know, a match that I looked forward to when the draw came out,” said Sharapova, who conspicuously avoided looking at Wozniacki — and vice versa — during the prematch coin toss.","But when they returned to the net nearly three hours later for the handshake, they made eye contact, two warriors to the battle born. Wozniacki’s strength is blasting balls from the baseline until her opponent blinks and, true to form, she engaged Sharapova in 23 rallies of at least nine shots. Sharapova won 17 of those points, including a 23-shot rally in the eighth game of the first set.","“Those are the rallies that I think many years ago that she used to win,” Sharapova said. “I thought I did a great job of getting a higher percentage of wins in those.”","Wozniacki had one forehand winner in the first two sets (to Sharapova’s 17) and prevailed in the second set despite hitting just one winner, off her backhand.","“You know I did my best out there,” Wozniacki said. “I was fighting till the end.”","Even as Wozniacki raced out to a 4-1 lead in the first set, she appeared to be long on guile and grit but short on gas. One of her second serves was clocked at 73 m.p.h. — and came back to her at 82 m.p.h.","Wozniacki, 28, was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis before last year’s U.S. Open, and Friday’s weather, which included rain and some thunder and lightning, presented perfect conditions for a flare-up. In Wozniacki’s postmatch news conference, a reporter, who identified herself as a rheumatoid arthritis sufferer, said she had been in quite a bit of discomfort because of the weather and asked Wozniacki about her pain levels.","“I’m O.K.,” Wozniacki said, adding, “Definitely don’t want to blame it on anything else. You know, she was just a little bit better than me today. And that was really it.”","Wozniacki, who returned to the top of the women’s world rankings with her victory here last year, will tumble out of the top five when the new rankings come out after the tournament’s conclusion. She was asked if Friday’s defeat stung any less because she would forevermore be known as a major champion.","“I’m a competitor,” Wozniacki said, adding, “I hate losing more than I love winning. Obviously you’re sitting here and you’re a little sad. But, you know, that’s what drives you.”","The 31-year-old Sharapova regularly fields questions about her motivation. Her 2018 season ended prematurely, in September, after her surgically repaired right shoulder started giving her fits. According to Forbes, Sharapova, a five-time major winner who has completed the career Grand Slam, has earned more than $280 million in her career. With an ostrich-size nest egg, why does she persist with the constant travel and daily grind?","The answer is simple, Sharapova said: For days like this.","“I felt very much in the moment,” she said. “I felt present.”","Sharapova added, “To be in the grind of things and to really have to figure out a way to be on top is what I missed.”"
"It’s the Late, Late, Late Show at the Australian Open - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — “I’ve never done this before,” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said as she climbed on a stationary bike in front of a crowd that didn’t feel that much smaller than the one that had watched her 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3 upset of fifth-seeded Sloane Stephens at the Australian Open.","The fourth-round match ended six minutes before 2 a.m. on Monday morning, and Pavlyuchenkova was mentally making a list of all the tasks that stood between her and a good morning’s sleep: the stationary bike, the reporters with their notebooks and microphones, the ice bath, the shower, the change of clothes, the drive back to the hotel.","Pavlyuchenkova asked if she could field questions from reporters while she pedaled so she could kill two tasks with one bike ride. She was so tired, she had struggled to construct her points on the court, and now she was having trouble organizing her thoughts in front of reporters.","That’s what a starting time of nearly half-past 11 will do to a player. “It’s honestly terrible,” Pavlyuchenkova said, adding, “It’s not ideal time to play tennis.”","Describing the match, she said, “I was like, ‘This match is so intense, why am I like still sometimes feeling like I’m going to fall asleep now?’”","The late, late, late show, with hosts Pavlyuchenkova and Stephens, started Sunday and ended Monday. Nine matches in the first eight days of the tournament ended after midnight, but Pavlyuchenkova’s win over Stephens wasn’t close to being the latest finish.","It was 12 minutes past 3 a.m. on Friday when Garbiñe Muguruza clinched her second-round match against Johanna Konta. By the time Muguruza met with her coach, showered, changed out of her tennis outfit, received a massage, fulfilled her media obligations and returned to her hotel, it was one hour before sunrise.","And Muguruza’s match wasn’t close to being the latest-ever finish in Australian Open history; that feather is in the pillows of Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis, whose third-round slugfest here in 2008, won by Hewitt, ended at 4:33 in the morning.","The prime-time television hours in Muguruza’s native Spain are from 10:30 p.m. until 1 a.m., so she knows from flawed time systems.","And yet, Muguruza, 25, readily acknowledged that playing that late “is not normal.” She added, “It was very awkward.”","The post-midnight hours would pose no problem if the players had the body clocks of the mostly nocturnal koala bear, who can sleep up to 22 hours. But the human body’s inner clock has a circadian low, a window roughly between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., when focus, strength, reaction time and physical flexibility ebb, the better to promote sleep.",The circadian rhythm can be reset by changing sleep or eating patterns. But how can players adjust their internal clocks for optimal performance when they’re playing at 2 a.m. one day and at 2 p.m. another?,"“There is no way to train that,” said Maria Sharapova, who advanced to the third round in a match that ended at 12:36 a.m. — or roughly two hours past her preferred bedtime.","“If you ask any player that goes into this tournament how many times they have trained after midnight, unless you’re jet lagged or just crazy, you don’t train for that.”","On the same night that Muguruza barely beat both Konta and daybreak, Novak Djokovic outlasted Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a match that ended 41 minutes past midnight. Djokovic, the men’s world No. 1, has a reputation for leaving few routes unexplored to gain a competitive edge. Over the years he has tried hyperbaric chambers, yoga, meditation, biofeedback and restrictive diets.",So is he crazy enough to have tried practicing after midnight?,"“No, I have not done that I don’t think ever,” Djokovic said.","He added with a laugh, “I’m not doing push-ups at midnight before I go to sleep. You train a bit later, and the whole routine is pushed back a little bit. But you also want to get a good night’s sleep so your biological rhythm keeps going in the right way.”","Djokovic has one strategy, grudgingly adopted, that helps him sleep longer and sounder during tournaments: he leaves his two small children at home. He may be on to something. Norah Simpson, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford who studies the role of sleep on athletic performance, recommends that players get good, quality sleep in the days before matches so they don’t go into a late-night match already sleep-deprived.","“It’s very challenging to navigate the variable schedule in respect to both your internal clock and the amount of sleep you’re able to obtain,” Simpson said in a telephone interview.","The potential for late-night matches is part of tournaments with stadium lights and no curfews. Madison Keys played mostly night matches on her way to the final at the 2017 United States Open, and recalled going to bed after 4 a.m. many mornings, waking up around noon and taking power naps whenever she could. “It’s not natural,” she said, adding, “If I know I’m playing a night match, I sleep as much as I can the day before.”","Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova’s coach, Simon Goffin, encouraged her to stay up until 1 a.m. the night before playing Stephens to help reset her body clock.","“I pushed her to watch a movie, do something, even after midnight, to be used to this kind of late match,” said Goffin, who also insisted that she sleep in until noon. “It’s important for the body and the mind to have this routine.”","Still, Pavlyuchenkova said she felt sluggish. “It was so, so strange because I was like ‘Come on, I have to make rallies!’” she said. “My energy level was on and off as well. I was trying to get as many energy drinks and gel packs as I could take.”","After ingesting all that caffeine, how did Pavlyuchenkova plan to get to sleep? “I don’t know honestly,” she said, adding, “Try to take chamomile tea?”"
"Roger Federer Knocked From Australian Open by Stefanos Tsitsipas, Age 20 - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia — A veteran right-hander with an all-court game and a one-handed backhand, the hands-down greatest player of his era, was trying to dodge an upset in a fourth-round match of a Grand Slam tournament against a former junior world No. 1 with long hair, a flowing one-handed backhand and no fear.","In their first official head-to-head meeting, Pete Sampras, then 29, could not hold off a 19-year-old Roger Federer, who won in five sets at Wimbledon in 2001.","On Sunday night at the Australian Open, Federer, the two-time defending champion, was the one looking across the net at a younger, fresher, more fearless version of himself. And like Sampras 18 years earlier, Federer had no answer for his fourth-round opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, a former junior world No. 1 from Greece who sent him packing with a 6-7 (11), 7-6 (3), 7-5, 7-6 (5) defeat in their first official head-to-head meeting.","Federer was the 15th seed in 2001 when he beat Sampras, the top seed and a seven-time Wimbledon champion. Tsitsipas, 20, is the 14th seed and the youngest player remaining in the men’s draw. With the victory, Tsitsipas foiled the 37-year-old Federer’s bid to become the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals here since the 43-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1977.","“I lost to a better player who was playing very well tonight,” said the third-seeded Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, including six titles in Australia. “He hung in there, gave himself chances at some point, stayed calm. It’s not always easy, especially for younger guys. Credit to him for taking care of that.”","The match lasted 3 hours 45 minutes, but Federer essentially cinched his fate two hours in, after he squandered eight break points, including three on unforced errors, to give Tsitsipas enough of an opening to squeeze past him in the second set.","“It definitely didn’t go the way I was hoping on the break points,” said Federer, who kept searching for a weakness to exploit only to see his strengths reflected back at him.","Tsitsipas looked eminently comfortable at the net and he matched Federer winner for winner on the forehand side, with 15.","“He did a nice job of taking care of his half volleys,” Federer said. “That’s maybe what won him the match tonight, I’m not sure.”","Perhaps pride kept Federer from equivocating. The difference in the match was Tsitsipas’s youthful energy, which he oozed with his every Tigger-like step. Federer simply couldn’t match it from the first point to the last, a backhand that he netted.","Federer wasted no time after the match completing his media responsibilities, leaving the clear impression that he couldn’t put this loss in his rearview mirror fast enough. His eyes grew glassy as his news conference wore on, as if his feelings about the loss had traveled from his mouth to his marrow.","“I have massive regrets, you know, tonight,” said Federer, who also announced he intended to play some events on clay this spring after skipping clay-court season the past two years. “I might not look the part, but I am. I felt like I have to win the second set. I don’t care how I do it, but I have to do it.”","Tsitsipas, who trains at the academy of Patrick Mouratoglou, whose best-known pupil is the 23-time major winner Serena Williams, was proud of the mental toughness he showed in fending off a dozen break points in all.","“I could have cracked at any moment,” he said, “but I didn’t because I really wanted it bad.”",Tsitsipas said he believed from the first point that he could pull off the upset and described the victory as “a beginning of something really big.”,"Tsitsipas broke onto the scene last year by reaching the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto in August, defeating four top-10 players, including Novak Djokovic, on the way.","Tsitsipas is in the quarterfinals of a major for the first time. He will face 22d-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut, 30, who will also be playing his first Grand Slam quarterfinal.","John McEnroe, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, conducted the post-match, on-court interview with Tsitsipas and described his victory as a changing of the guard.","“I’ve heard that story the last 10 years,” Federer said. “From that standpoint, nothing new.”","He had a point. Consider Grigor Dimitrov, now 27, who made it to the quarterfinals here in 2014. He lost Sunday to Frances Tiafoe and is 0 for 34 in majors.","Before Dimitrov, there was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, now 33, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the 2008 final here and hasn’t advanced to another Grand Slam final.","Even a player like Andy Murray, whose sterling career included major titles and wins over Federer, fell short of Federer’s gold standard.","So, yes, the torch has been passed, only to get extinguished. But there was a hint of resignation in Federer’s voice and a slump in his shoulders during his news conference that belied the breeziness of his rebuttal to McEnroe’s observation.","“About Stefanos, I think he’s definitely done a really nice job now the last year and a half,” Federer said, adding, “I see him definitely being high up in the game for a long time. This was a good night for him tonight.”","After Sampras lost to Federer at Wimbledon, he won one more major, the 2002 United States Open, then retired. How many more chances will Federer get to grow his legacy?","Federer looked irked when he was asked if he could see a bit of himself in Tsitsipas, the son of two tennis coaches, who has described Federer as his childhood idol.","“He has a one-handed backhand and I used to have long hair, too,” Federer said. “Yeah, so maybe a little bit, sure.”"
Another Football League Is on the Edge of Folding - The New York Times,"The Alliance of American Football is planning to suspend operations and will not play games this weekend, according to three people familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.","The league isn’t officially folding, the people said Tuesday, at least not yet. An official announcement about its status was expected soon. In a statement, Bill Polian, one of the league’s founders, confirmed the decision and expressed disappointment.","The Alliance is the latest in a long line of upstart professional football leagues that tried and failed to capitalize on the seemingly insatiable appetite for the sport in America. Because the N.F.L. draws an average of about 15 million viewers for each game over its five-month season, the start-up owners tend to assume that a new league with just a fraction of that audience will succeed.",It hasn’t turned out that way.,"Since the American Football League merged with the N.F.L. in 1970, there has been the World Football League, the United States Football League, the once and future XFL, the United Football League and others. While they have had varying business models, franchise locations and opinions on the best calendar for football, none of the leagues has yet found the right formula for sustained success.",Now it seems the Alliance for American Football will soon follow them to the grave.,"The league’s chief executive and co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, probably should have known better. He the son of Dick Ebersol, the longtime NBC Sports chairman who started the first iteration of the XFL nearly 20 years ago, alongside the professional wrestling impresario Vince McMahon. That league folded after a single season.","With the help of Polian, the former general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Ebersol secured distribution deals for some of the league’s games on CBS, TNT and the NFL Network, a strong sign for a new league. The deals included little cash, however, according to two of the people.","“I think there is a blind spot for most people that want to start professional sports leagues,” said Michael Huyghue, who was the commissioner of the United Football League. “The biggest issue is: What is the revenue stream? What is the revenue model?” The U.F.L. began play in 2009 and ceased operations in 2012.","Most leagues require substantial television rights payments to survive, as well as a critical mass of ticket sales. Both are difficult to obtain for an unproven league. Knowing how substantial the start-up costs would be, the Alliance tried to justify its operations by comparing itself to a Silicon Valley tech company that expects to lose money for years while creating value. Ebersol believed the league’s technology and readiness for legalized gambling would make it a success.","From the beginning, Ebersol had modest expectations for Year One.","“There are going to be empty seats for quite some time, but we are committed to long-term investment around the idea,” he said in an interview in February, shortly before the season began.",He estimated the Alliance would require $500 million to $750 million during the first five years.,"“You have to justify that expense, because either you are an eccentric billionaire creating a football league or raising really smart money that is patient,” Ebersol said.","The Alliance’s eight teams, clustered in the Southeast and Southwest, began play after the Super Bowl. They have each played eight regular season games, with the championship game scheduled for April 27 in Frisco, Tex.","But almost from the beginning, there were signs that things weren’t going well, including reports that the league had almost missed payroll.","Last week the league’s controlling owner, Tom Dundon, told USA Today that the league was in danger of folding because it hadn’t secured an agreement with the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association to allow young players from N.F.L. rosters to work in the Alliance.","“If the players union is not going to give us young players, we can’t be a development league,” said Dundon, who is also the owner of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes. Just two weeks into the Alliance’s game schedule, he committed up to $250 million and became the controlling owner.","But to Huyghue, whose United Football League lasted almost four seasons, that was the wrong focus.","“Everyone keeps thinking players, players, players,” he said. “That doesn’t solve your revenue problem.”","Polian’s statement blamed Dundon for the decision to suspend the league. “When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all,” Polian said.",Dundon could not be reached for comment.,"Despite the poor track record, the Alliance surely won’t be the last attempt to start a new professional football league. McMahon is reviving the XFL, which is to begin play next year, and last week he sold almost $272 million in World Wrestling Entertainment stock to support the venture, according to a company filing. The Pacific Pro League, founded by Don Yee, Tom Brady’s agent, is also set to start playing next year.","The A.A.F.’s decision to shut down has immediate repercussions for at least one of the Alliance’s partners. Saturday afternoon’s game between Memphis and San Antonio was scheduled to be shown on CBS, serving as the lead-in to the two men’s Final Four college basketball games."
"In Texas, the Land of Football, It’s Rugby to the Rescue - The New York Times","ARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.","The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.","The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.","“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.","From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.","After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.","That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.","“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.","Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.","Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.","Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.","Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.","In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.","Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:","“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”","Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.","Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.","But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.",And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.,"Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.","Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’","At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.","“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”","As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.","Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.","“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”"

More Restrictions Are Placed on Youth Football in Canada - The New York Times,"Canadian children age 12 and younger will no longer be able to play the fullest version of tackle football starting in 2022. The restriction was devised by Football Canada, the sanctioning body for youth football in the country, as the latest in a series of steps to protect players from concussions and potential long-term cognitive problems.","Randy Ambrosie, the commissioner of the Canadian Football League, which works closely with Football Canada, announced the change Wednesday in Ottawa at a parliamentary hearing on concussions and sports.","“While we enthusiastically support tackle football for older age groups, we are putting a huge emphasis on flag football for young girls and boys,” Ambrosie said.","Football Canada has a number of categories for the versions of tackle football children can play and when they can do so. Already, children 8 or younger are not allowed to play tackle football. Children 10 and younger are allowed to play only six-on-six tackle football, or non-contact versions of the game, like flag football.","The new rule for will prohibit children 12 and under from playing 12-on-12 football, the version of the game used in Canadian colleges and in professional leagues. Children from 10 to 12 years old will still be able to play six-on-six tackle football and nine-on-nine, as well as non-contact football.","Some research has shown that people who started playing tackle football before age 12 were at greater risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, compared with those who started playing tackle football after age 12.","In some ways, Canada has taken more steps to protect its players than the United States has. In 2017, for instance, the Canadian Football League barred players from deliberately slamming into one another during regular-season practices, and while they still wear helmets, they no longer wear shoulder pads and other protective gear in practices.","The N.F.L. has reduced, but not eliminated, full-contact practices during the season. The Ivy League is the only United States college conference to have ended full-contact football practices in the regular season.",The C.F.L. also added a third bye week to its 18-game calendar so there would be more time between games for players to recover.,"Ambrosie, who played nine seasons in the C.F.L. and became commissioner of the league in 2017, has accelerated the introduction of safety measures partly to ward off potential lawsuits, but also to restore confidence in the sport, which has been losing players faster than in the United States.","The number of children in Canada playing tackle or non-contact forms of football has plummeted since 2010, to 100,000 from 170,000, according to government surveys and research by the C.F.L.","“Support for football in this country is underwhelming and disappointing,” Ambrosie told lawmakers in the House of Commons Subcommittee on Sports-Related Concussions. “At times it can feel like it’s under attack.”"
Opinion | Do More for Football Players With Head Trauma - The New York Times,To the Editor:,"Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):","Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.","While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.","A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.",It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.,"Daniel R.

Johnny Manziel Barred From Canadian Football League - The New York Times,Quarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.,"The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”","“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”",Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.,"“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”","Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.","“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”","Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.","Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month.

Massachusetts Bill Would Ban Tackle Football Until After Seventh Grade - The New York Times,"Less than a month after the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.","The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislature’s Joint Committee on Public Health this week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.","The bipartisan bill, known as No Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.","“There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development,” one of the bill’s sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.","Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure and public opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.","Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.","“Should we ban youth soccer too?” asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. “Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldn’t be?”","A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, which governs youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are “best left to parents.” To that end, she said, it has created a set of guidelines developed by leaders in athlete development and football.","The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. “Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids,” he said.","Studies by Boston University and other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.","But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer who teaches a legal course on traumatic brain injury and tracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth league’s promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies’ offering low-nicotine cigarettes.","“People don’t understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks,” he said. “It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.”","Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of the Massachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.","“Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground,” he said, “it seems like an overstep of authority.”","Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coaches youth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.","“I understand the concern,” he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the “knuckle-dragging days” when “you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking” during practice.","He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introduced shoulder-tackling techniques developed by U.S.A. Football.","Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots’ head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not “a political guy.”","“But,” he said, “I’ll definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.”","In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, which increasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.","There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association adopted new guidelines intended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.",But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues were quashed by grass-roots movements led by parents and coaches.,"When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jersey proposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.",That bill is currently in limbo.,"“Unfortunately, the old boys’ club of politics and football go hand in hand,” said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. “This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.”","A similar bill in New York failed, and California’s Safe Football Act was pulled before a committee vote. The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,  did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Maryland’s proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer, was killed in committee.","These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.","“I really did not expect it to pass,” said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Maryland’s bill.","“But I think it’s a conversation we have to have,” she said, “and I don’t think the conversation is over.”","Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.","“Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem,” he said. “If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.”"

New Jersey Unveils New Limits on High School Football Practices - The New York Times,"Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.","The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.",The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.,"“I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy,” said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.","The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.",Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.,"Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the school’s Alzheimer’s Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is “good evidence” to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football — and not just those involving concussions — and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.","“I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head,” Mez said. “But given the country’s interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.”","Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularly  in New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.","In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states — Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma — lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.","Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.","“We’re not doing this as a recruiting ploy,” he said. “It’s just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they won’t have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.”","Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coaches seminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.","The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.","The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.","Terry O’Neil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, “is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.”"

"Ahead of Super Bowl, Trump Raises Doubts on Tackle Football for His Son - The New York Times","ATLANTA — Hours before the sport’s biggest game, President Trump joined the growing ranks of parents anxious over tackle football, saying in an interview he “would have a hard time” letting his 12-year-old son play.","“I mean, it’s a dangerous sport and I think it’s, I, it’s really tough” if his son wanted to take up the game, Mr. Trump said in an interview with CBS ahead of its Sunday evening broadcast of the Super Bowl.","The president’s concerns are at odds with his previous criticism that the N.F.L. has been making the game too soft to avoid concussions and other injuries, and suggest that he is struggling with many of the same questions that parents across the country are asking about the safety of youth tackle football.","Mr. Trump said he would ultimately let his youngest son, Barron, who plays soccer, decide if he wanted to play tackle football and would not steer him away from the sport.","[Super Bowl 2019: Game time, live updates and scores.]","But the president said he had seen reports about the dangers of playing tackle football, and heard that some N.F.L. players were not letting their sons play tackle football.","His comments added another wrinkle to his ambivalent relationship with the game he often celebrates, but also laments. His doubts about the safety of the game come five years after President Barack Obama said that if he had a son, he would not let him play professional football.","Some studies have suggested that playing tackle football before age 12 puts athletes at a higher risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, but the issue has not been widely studied. In general, there has been growing awareness of C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease many former players have developed from repeated hits to the head.","As a result of such concerns, participation in flag football has exploded.","Yet while Mr. Obama held a forum at the White House on the dangers of concussions, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said the N.F.L. is being overprotective.","In September 2017, for instance, Mr. Trump complained that the N.F.L. was ruining the game because the referees were trying to control unnecessarily rough tackles.","“Today if you hit too hard — 15 yards! Throw him out of the game!” he said, adding: “They’re ruining the game! They’re ruining the game. That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game.”","At a campaign rally in 2016, Mr. Trump referred to a woman in the audience who fainted, but returned to the crowd.","“The woman was out cold and now she’s coming back,” he said. “See? We don’t go by these new, and very much softer, N.F.L. rules. Concussion. Oh, oh! Got a little ding on the head. No, no, you can’t play for the rest of the season. Our people are tough.”",Trump also called the N.F.L. “soft” for penalizing helmet-to-helmet hits.,"In the CBS interview, however, he sounded more cautionary notes.","“I hate to say it, because I love to watch football,” Mr. Trump said. “I think the N.F.L. is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son — well, I’ve heard N.F.L. players saying they wouldn’t let their sons play football. So, it’s not totally unique, but I, I would have a hard time with it.”"
Grab and Go: How Sticky Gloves Have Changed Football - The New York Times,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.","Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.","The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.","The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.","The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.","“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”","For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.","“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”","When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.","According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.","“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”","That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.","Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.","The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).","(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)","Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.","“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.","But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”","The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.","The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.","Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.","“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.","Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.","With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.","The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.","Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.","“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.","That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”","The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.","In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.","In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.","“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”","Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did."
"Johnny (Lam) Jones, Texas Track and Football Star, Dies at 60 - The New York Times","Johnny (Lam) Jones, a former Olympic gold medal sprinter and swift-footed football star at the University of Texas who never lived up to his promise as a football professional with the Jets, died on Friday. He was 60.","His death was announced by the university, which said it came “after a lengthy battle with cancer.” Texas news organizations said he died in a hospital in Round Rock, Tex., north of Austin.","Jones learned that he had multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, in 2005. Because he did not have health insurance, former Texas teammates raised money for his medical costs.","Jones was phenomenon at his central Texas high school, in the city of Lampasas, running world-class times of 9.21 seconds for 100 yards and 10.14 for 100 meters.","After graduating, he competed that summer in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, finishing sixth in the 100 meters and winning a gold medal running the second leg of the United States 4x100-meter relay team.","He then enrolled at Texas, where his speed landed him on both the track and football teams. He would go on to become a record-setting All-American sprinter for the university.","In his freshman year he ran in the same backfield as another Johnny Jones. To distinguish the two, Coach Darrell Royal gave one the nickname Lam, for Jones’s hometown, and the other the nickname Ham, because that Jones came from Hamlin, Tex.","Lam Jones, at 5 feet 11 and 190 pounds, was a wide receiver in his last three years as a Longhorn, 1977-79, and an All-American in his senior year. He scored eight touchdowns of 45 yards or more at Texas and was chosen the team’s most valuable player in 1978.","In the 1980 National Football League draft, the Jets traded two first-round picks to be able to move up and make Jones their first pick (and the draft’s second choice overall). He signed for $2.1 million over six years (the equivalent of $6.8 million today); it was pro football’s first million-dollar contract.","But his pro career was an injury-ridden disappointment. In his first season in New York, he caught 25 passes but dropped 18. In his second season, his main job was to run in plays from the Jets’ offensive coordinator, Joe Walton, to the quarterback, Richard Todd. The New York Times sports columnist Dave Anderson called him “the Jets’ millionaire messenger.”","There were a few highlights for Jones that season, however, including catching a 47-yard touchdown pass from Todd in a playoff-clinching 28-3 victory over the Green Bay Packers at Shea Stadium in New York. (The Jets, in the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, went on to lose to the Buffalo Bills in a wild-card game the next week.)","In five seasons (1980-84) with the Jets, Jones suffered a broken collarbone, a pulled hamstring and a torn finger tendon. He spent 1985 and 1986 on the Jets’ injured reserve list. The next year, the Jets traded him to the San Francisco 49ers.","“I know how they remember me in New York: I’m the guy they blew the draft pick on,” Jones told The Daily News in 2005. “That’s O.K. I didn’t live up to their expectations, but I didn’t live up to my own expectations, either.”","He did worse in San Francisco: The 49ers promptly waived him in training camp. He then joined the Dallas Cowboys, who dropped him after he missed a morning meeting because, the team said, he had been drinking and had overslept.","Indeed, he told The News that he had struggled with alcohol and cocaine addictions both during his playing days and afterward.","As a pro, Jones caught 138 passes for 2,322 yards and 13 touchdowns. His best season was in 1983, with 43 catches, 734 yards and four touchdowns.","“Games and challenges never scared Johnny,” Bill Little, an assistant athletic director at Texas, recalled on a Texas football website in 2004. “People did. Folks thought he was just extremely shy and sometimes rude. Years later, they would diagnose the condition he had as social anxiety disorder.”","In 1988, his playing days over and living again in Texas, Jones served a month in jail after pleading guilty to indecency with a child, a 12-year-old girl. The episode was a turning point, he later said, compelling him to seek treatment for his addictions.","“I needed to get my personal life in order,” he was quoted as saying. “I came back to live in the real world.”","He sold cars and running tracks, made motivational speeches to high school athletes and was active with the Texas Special Olympics.","In 1979, Jones donated his Olympic gold medal to the Special Olympics. Years later, he explained why: “I’d never seen anyone stop in a race and help someone who had fallen get up.”","John Wesley Jones II was born on April 4, 1958, in Lawton, Okla., to John W. Jones and Mary Jones Dillon. His father was an Army sergeant who was later transferred to Texas.",Lam Jones was married and divorced three times. There was no immediate information available about survivors.,"Jones was philosophical about the up-and-down course his life had taken. He was quoted by Bill Little on the Texas website: “I got to run in the Olympics, got a great education and played for the University of Texas and played for the New York Jets.”","“I learned a lot,” he added, “and I had some tough lessons.”"
"When Is a Hacker a Whistle-Blower? In Football Leaks Case, a Hungarian Judge Will Decide - The New York Times","Over the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.","Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.","For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.","In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.","Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.","Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.","Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.","“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”","Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)","More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.","Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.","“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”","Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.","“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”","Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.",Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.,"In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.","Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.","Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”","Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.","But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”","In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.","“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.",“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”

Tarik Cohen Makes Football Fun Again in Chicago - The New York Times,"LAKE FOREST, Ill. — During practice last Thursday afternoon, Tarik Cohen caught a punt. Still clutching the ball, he proceeded to catch another. And another. And another. And another. And another.",And another.,"By the end of this wacky experiment, Cohen was cradling seven balls — one, roughly, for every role he has with the Chicago Bears.","Cohen is — O.K., deep breath — the Bears’ handoff-taking, punt-returning, ball-catching, pass-throwing, mismatch-creating, gasp-inducing, highlight-monopolizing cyborg. A year after becoming the first rookie since Gale Sayers, a former Bear, in 1965, to contribute touchdowns by running, receiving, passing and punt return, Cohen has further obliterated concerns that a 5-foot-6 running back from the humble Football Championship Subdivision would struggle transitioning to the N.F.L.’s rugged N.F.C. North.",[Wild-Card Weekend: Our Predictions for the N.F.L. Playoffs],"If the quarterback-wrecking edge rusher Khalil Mack embodies a defense that has fueled the Bears’ worst-to-first ascent — as the N.F.C.’s third seed, they’ll face the No. 6-seeded Eagles in the wild-card round on Sunday, their first playoff appearance since 2010 — Cohen personifies the offense installed by the team’s first-year coach, Matt Nagy: creative, unpredictable and, at times, downright fun. Nagy has maximized Cohen’s speed, suddenness and receiving skills by aligning him around the formation, from the backfield to the inside to the outside, turning him into, in effect, Chicago’s offensive version of Mack: the player opponents must stalk wherever he is on the field. He led the team in catches (71), yards from scrimmage (1,169) and all-purpose yardage (1,599), and was voted onto the All-Pro team as punt returner.","“He’s got a lot of strengths and not a lot of weaknesses,” Nagy said. “Having him be a part of what we do and what we scheme is a huge advantage.”","Soon after the Bears hired Nagy away from Kansas City, where he served for five seasons on Andy Reid’s staff, Cohen heard that last season the Chiefs featured three players who gained more than 1,000 yards: receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce and running back Kareem Hunt. Cohen did not know when or how he would get the ball in Chicago, he said, only that he would.","“Get me the ball and get me in space,” Cohen said.","That just might be his motto. His 170 touches rank second on the team, behind Jordan Howard, the primary rusher. As a runner, Cohen has the seventh-best breakaway percentage in the N.F.L., gaining 44.4 percent of his 444 yards on carries of at least 15 yards, according to Pro Football Focus. As a receiver, Cohen averages 10.2 yards per reception, most among the 20 backs with at least 40 catches, according to Pro Football Reference.","As the position has evolved, a hybridized strain of running back has permeated the league, players as comfortable with, and capable of, lining up in the slot or being split wide as they are rushing 20 times per game. Cohen does not run as often as other versatile second-year dynamos like the Panthers’ Christian McCaffrey or the Saints’ Alvin Kamara, but his proficiency in the passing game — his 175 snaps away from the backfield were the most among running backs — has made him, according to Pro Football Focus’s Wins Above Replacement metric, the second-most valuable player at his position, just behind McCaffrey.","“I don’t think there’s anything he can’t do,” Bears running back Benny Cunningham said.","The Bears’ vast playbook — Minnesota Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer quipped earlier this season that it contained 800 plays — demands Cohen know entire passing concepts because any week he could line up at four or five different spots. His first-year position coach, Charles London, marveled early on at Cohen’s savvy — how he can see a drawing or a video of a play and master his responsibilities on the field in a repetition or two. His improvement as a blocker has helped Chicago disguise its calls, diminishing tendencies that his alignment might have tipped off.","“There’s not really a route — at running back or receiver — that he can’t run in this offense,” London said.","That was Cohen’s objective during the off-season, he said, when he devoted two days a week to refining routes that come back to the ball, like curls, during seven-on-seven drills with his former North Carolina A&T teammates. He did not want to be branded as only a deep-ball threat, just as he does not want to be perceived as strictly a perimeter runner, someone unwilling — or worse, not stout enough — to run between the tackles.","Further evidence: Ask Cohen his top play from this season, and he mentions not the 70-yard screen against the Jets, the 50-yard catch-and-dash at Miami or the overtime-forcing touchdown toss at the Giants. In his mind, all the feints, cutbacks and bursts that evoke his favorite player, Reggie Bush, do not compare to the punt he fielded midway through the first quarter against New England in Week 7, when he stepped left, cut right, then zipped left again, shedding a tackle at his feet before encountering a defender by the boundary squaring up to level him.",The contact was brief. The defender crumpled. Cohen did not.,"“Somebody so small running somebody big over — it makes everybody’s day,” Cohen said.","Cohen is short but, listed at 181 pounds, not small. He is thick and sturdy, with disproportionately enormous hands — size 10⅛ from thumb to pinkie, bigger than those of hulking receiving threats like Kelce, Julio Jones and A.J. Green — that help him do things like, say, hold on to seven balls at the same time.","Growing up in rural Bunn, N.C., about 30 miles northeast of Raleigh, Cohen specialized in such exploits. For one, he developed his speed — like another Bears playmaker before him — through unorthodox methods. Instead of running through tall, thick grass, as Devin Hester did, Cohen dodged the pit bulls that he said roamed his neighborhood.","“It’s fight or flight,” Cohen said. “Either get going or you’re going to get eat, so you’ve got to get out of there.”","He did get out of there — to play football, but barely. Had North Carolina A&T, a historically black university, not offered him a scholarship, Cohen would have joined the Navy.",Why?,"“I knew how to swim,” said Cohen, sitting in the Halas Hall lobby before practice one day last week. “And it wasn’t like people were getting killed in the Navy.”","Rather than enlist, Cohen opted to dominate the F.C.S. Across his four seasons at A&T, he rushed for a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 5,619 yards, the 10th-most in the history of what was formerly Division I-AA. But when N.F.L. scouts passed through Greensboro, said Shawn Gibbs, his position coach at A&T, some seemed unconvinced.","“They just tried to poke holes in everything he did — like, he’s good, but,” Gibbs said. “The guys that were like: ‘Man, this guy can walk under this table. I can’t take him to my G.M.’ Those were the guys that were frustrating.”","It was the Bears’ good fortune that their scout who prowls the Southeast, Sam Summerville, attended a historically black college himself. Before even studying Cohen, Summerville admired him as a fan, watching from afar as he rushed for 295 yards — and touchdowns of 74, 83 and 73 yards — against Alcorn State in the Celebration Bowl.","The deeper he probed, the more Summerville believed in Cohen. Not as a gadget player, but as an N.F.L. running back. At Summerville’s urging, the Bears deployed additional scouts to evaluate him, and they, too, grew enamored. Still, as they prepped for the 2017 draft, Summerville expected pushback — for everything from Cohen’s statistics, perceived to be inflated by the lesser competition, to his stature. So he relied on emotion as much as reason to convey why they needed him.","In an impassioned plea, Summerville showed his colleagues the clip of Cohen catching two balls while doing a back flip. (Yes, really.) He affirmed that rival coaches feared no player more than Cohen. He explained that of the 350 to 400 players he assessed in the fall of 2016, Cohen was “definitely” his favorite.","“It got to the point where some of the other scouts may have been rolling their eyes a little bit, like, ‘this guy’s serious,’” Summerville said. “Every time I opened my mouth about him, or every time a question was asked, they were like, ‘Do you think this guy can do this?’ Tarik can do pretty much everything you ask him to.”","The Bears chose Cohen with one of their fourth-round selections — they took another foundational player, safety Eddie Jackson, seven picks earlier — and before he even took a snap, Cunningham exhorted his friends to draft him for their fantasy football teams. Many satisfied customers, he said.","Over the summer, Summerville reviewed his reports on Cohen, to check whether reality matched projections. It did not. Cohen surpassed them. One after another after another after another.",And another.
I Quit Watching Football Because It Harms Players. Can I Still Keep Up With My Team? - The New York Times,"I have decided to stop watching football given the recent findings about the frequency with which concussions occur and the long-term effects of those concussions on the players. I am not trying to take a stand and change any of my family’s or friends’ opinions, but I do want to feel like I’m doing my part. ","Can I still follow my team in some way, though? I’m a Jets fan (O.K., maybe I’m not giving up much by not watching), and I really like keeping up with their season. What involvement with the team would be ethical? Can I read up on the team in the newspaper? What if I walk into a restaurant and a game is on television? Is it O.K. if I watch it there? After all, they’ve chosen to play, and maybe I should respect that. Name Withheld","A body of research suggests that football causes long-term brain damage in many players. Still, as you point out, the players are in a position to decide for themselves whether they want to run the risks. Those who do well in the sport expect to earn more money and more glory than they would in another endeavor. So you could just think this puts the responsibility on them. If they’re rational, they are, in effect, making the judgment that they are better off playing than not, even with a serious prospect of incurring chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), not to mention other chronic injuries and conditions.","That’s not the end of the discussion, though. When it comes to exposing workers to hazards, our views aren’t straightforward. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2016 show 24,650 nonfatal injuries among construction workers, 28,740 injuries among local law-enforcement officers, 80,180 injuries among those for whom driving is part of their job. If you choose to be a roofer rather than a groundskeeper and accept a greater risk of injury for more pay, we’re O.K. with that. But the reason we have OSHA standards is that we think measures to abate hazards should be taken where feasible. The potential for grievous injury is surely part of why people watch Nascar races; we still expect drivers to use six-point harnesses and flame-retardant suits.","It isn’t obvious how this principle should be applied to a game like football. Some think that new high-tech helmets will help; others argue that no helmets at all would be safer, because (as in rugby) it might discourage head collisions. Players spend much more time in practice than in actual games, and some think that practice needs to be reformed to avoid the subconcussive impacts that have been linked to C.T.E. There’s more research to be done, more rethinking of the rules of the game. Players who lower their heads and initiate helmet contact can now be penalized, and maybe there’s a way to expand that penalty category. The existing penalties can certainly be increased and made more of a deterrent. Shortening the preseason could help, too. But if you really care about the welfare of football players, you should want not just to turn your back on bad practices but also to advocate for better ones.","A utilitarian, who assesses actions by their effects, would point out that nothing you’re proposing to do contributes to that effort. You can avoid newspaper coverage or screens in sports bars, but given your refusal to urge anyone else to refrain from attending or watching games, that gesture will be undetectable to the football authorities, not to mention sports journalists, and puts no pressure on them. (At least in picking the Jets to follow you’ve made it easier to skip every Super Bowl, from which fate seems to have decided they would be excluded for the past half-century.)","But again, that’s not the end of the discussion. Might there be a reason to shun a harmful activity even if doing so won’t have beneficial effects? There are two lines of argument to consider here: one associated with Immanuel Kant and the other with Aristotle. A Kantian test for assessing an action is to consider whether it flows from a principle that you’d have reason to want everyone to follow. Let’s suppose everyone’s boycotting football would lead to swift changes to make the game much safer or even bring the sport to an end. (Here, the utilitarian would note that the end of football might lead to worse lives for those who now play the game at all levels and to the loss not just of a lot of pleasure among fans but also of jobs for commentators, stadium staff, officials and the like.) You can still wonder whether that Kantian strategy of the universalized maxim matters if, in the real world, none of your sports-fan friends are going to follow your lead.","One reason to refrain from fandom is simply that you may not want to be the sort of person who takes pleasure in a game that is causing serious and unnecessary harm to its players. An approach to ethics that focuses on what kind of person you are — so-called virtue ethics — is often associated with Aristotle. It tends to judge action in terms of character, rather than the other way around, and you hear its echoes in a familiar formula of reproval: “What kind of person would ... ?”","Let me offer a final consideration: In following the game, in joining the culture that sustains football, in its current form, as an American institution, you are not causing harm directly — but you are, in a sense, participating in causing harm. You’ve been enlisted in a collective action that you view with disapproval. In this regard, you can be part of the problem, even if the problem would persist if you weren’t.","My husband and I are struggling to conceive. We’ve been seeing a fertility specialist and going through cycles of treatment. We started with oral medications, to which unfortunately I stopped responding. We have since moved on to injectable medications. If this doesn’t work, we’ll at some point have to start thinking about IVF. ","Though I desperately want to have a baby of our own, I’m struggling with whether it is ethical to go through the rather incredible lengths to get pregnant that IVF requires when there are children who urgently need homes. I know that the cost of adoption, and the difficulty of actually successfully adopting a baby, make it likely as emotionally grueling (and more expensive than) as an IVF cycle. Still, the effort would go to providing a home for a baby who needs one. ","More pressing is the number of children in the foster-care system. We’ve talked about fostering children in the future, but in our minds that would occur after we’d had some experience parenting. I do not feel that right now we could take on the enormous responsibility of foster care. I do feel we are ready for a baby of our own; children in foster care generally need a great deal more than a new baby does.","The bottom line is this: Though I want to have a biological child, and my husband definitely does want to go to IVF if it comes to that, I am struggling to wrap my head around going through so much intervention when we could instead take in a child who needs a home. ","Am I off base here, or do we have a duty to give homes to children who need them when we can’t easily have children of our own? Name Withheld","Taking on a child who already exists and needs a home is an enormously worthy thing to do, if you’re confident that you can bond with him or her and create a loving environment. But you don’t have a duty to adopt one. There are many things we each could do — such as being a parent to one of the hundred thousand or so foster children in this country who need a new family — that would improve the world. But morality doesn’t demand that we do all the good we can. If you had a duty to adopt a foster child, it wouldn’t be enormously worthy, just required.",Plenty of couples want to conceive but would choose to have no children rather than adopt a foster child. That’s essentially the position you’re in: You don’t feel prepared to provide foster care. It follows that a child you and your husband might have together wouldn’t be depriving a foster child of a home. And you’re not obliged to remain childless.
The Helicopter Parent Descends on College Football - The New York Times,"When Leslie Smith, a high school senior from Miami, made his official visit to the University of Pittsburgh last month, he got an idea before a photo shoot in which he was to pose wearing the Panthers’ football uniform.","He asked his mother, Lucretia Chapple, who was accompanying him on his visit, to put on the jersey.",His request was too mild for her.,"“She decided, ‘I’m going to put on the whole uniform,’” Smith said.","The result is a pair of pictures of Smith, who will suit up for Pitt more regularly next season as a freshman linebacker, and Chapple, who in years past played basketball and ran track. Both are clad in the school’s blue and gold colors, head to almost-toe (they did not appear to have cleats that fit Chapple). Long hair flows from the back of her helmet.","“She looks pretty good in that uniform,” said Smith’s future coach, Pat Narduzzi. “She looks like a player.”","Parents of college-age students have long proudly advertised where their students attend school on sweatshirts, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, etc.","But football parents — a special species of sports parent — have a new twist on that this year. As national signing day dawns Wednesday, the trend du jour is parents dressing up in uniforms alongside their talented sons.","The resulting shots are, of course, posted to Twitter and Instagram, from which they ricochet across the web.","“I had buddies coming up to me being like, ‘You know you’re on Barstool Sports?’” said Steve Snyder, who posed alongside his son, Sam, a tight end, during Sam’s official visit to Missouri.","There may be no bigger date on the calendar for college football teams than signing day, since personnel overwhelmingly dictates a team’s ultimate success or failure. For the past two years, players have also been able to sign during a brief window in December, as Smith did, but signing day is still when ultimate judgment about coaches’ recruiting is rendered.","“For college football, recruiting is the lifeblood,” said Luke Stampini, a recruiting analyst at 247Sports. “If you’re not recruiting well, you’re probably not going to be around for long.”","The uniform photo-op arguably reflects broader currents in child rearing. It could be cast as helicopter-parenting — or perhaps the next generation of helicopter-parenting, in which the parent ropes down from the chopper right after his child.","“This is the era of ‘we’ parenting, i.e., ‘We have a midterm. We’ve got a game tomorrow. We’re being recruited by top-tier schools,’” Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former Stanford administrator and the author of “How to Raise an Adult,” said in an email.","“If the child is wearing a jersey signaling their recruitment status, the we-speaking parent wants that cool jersey, too,” she said, adding, “But where does this intertwined-ness stop?”","What the novelty undeniably reveals is a crucial secret to recruiting nowadays. For all the talk that prognosticators may offer about how well a certain linebacker meshes with a certain coordinator’s defensive philosophy or how successful a college program is at developing players for the N.F.L., much of recruiting comes down to the more basic element of feel. Even for top football players, college football is also college, and that means getting the family to sign on, too.","“The recruiting process is not just about the player. They can’t recruit the player. They’ve got to recruit the family,” said Jamal Hill, who posed alongside his older brother, Jeffrey, who got to wear Oregon’s neon green uniform as opposed to Jamal’s black one.","“It’s a long-term decision,” Hill added. “You’ve got to trust them. Once you start recruiting the whole family, that makes it go more smoothly.”","During their campus visits, recruits typically tour not only football facilities but academic ones. Coaches are as likely to shoot the breeze as to draw Xs and Os on a whiteboard, hoping to make recruits — and their families — feel like their college is a suitable home-away-from-home.","Steve Ognenovic — whose son Nikolas, a tight end, posed alongside his father at Pitt and Kentucky before signing with the latter — recalled a long visit with Auburn Coach Gus Malzahn. “We spent 20 minutes talking about football,” Ognenovic said. “The rest was about the new addition on his deck, the truck he bought. He’s a regular guy.”","The trend can also be a way for coaches to signal to recruits, present and future, what kind of program they are running. For instance, Florida’s second-year head coach, Dan Mullen, appears intent on reintroducing to Gainesville the kind of whimsy one expects from a team whose fans do a gator-chop on game days.","In contrast, a Tennessee assistant coach recently spoke out against the practice, tweeting that one of the things he prays for was “that I NEVER have to outfit someone’s dad in full gear for a photo shoot.” It is not shocking that the assistant first worked with Tennessee’s head coach, Jeremy Pruitt, when both were on the staff of Alabama’s supremely buttoned-up Nick Saban, whose recruits are probably less likely to pose alongside mom or dad.","So why do some kids and parents want these photographs, which may be compelling but are also a little bit absurd? And why do they make heavy rotation on social media and in the sports blogosphere?","The photos are a reminder of the human dimension in college football’s annual meat market. For all the hoopla over which program has signed the best class (spoiler: yet again, it will probably be Alabama) and which team whiffed on a prized in-state offensive lineman, often overlooked is how big a day this is for the prospects themselves, who, like so many other adolescents who are less gifted on the gridiron, are finally completing the large and much-celebrated process of deciding where to go to college.","Steve Snyder said that, when a Missouri coach asked if he wanted to put a jersey on, “I thought to myself, how many opportunities am I ever going to get to have an experience like this with my son?”","His son ended up signing with Baylor, and, Snyder said, friends and family had already loaded up on Bears gear. “You’re very proud parents,” he said. “Lot of hard work.”"

Brazil Football Legend Pele Leaves Hospital in France - The New York Times,"PARIS — Brazilian soccer legend Pele was discharged from a French hospital on Monday after recovering from a urinary infection, media in France reported.","Pele, 78, was admitted to the hospital in Paris last Wednesday with a strong fever, after attending an event in the city with France's World Cup-winning player Kylian Mbappe.","Pele, considered by many as soccer's best-ever player and the winner of three World Cups with the Brazilian national team, was treated with antibiotics and said on Friday he was feeling much better.",There was no immediate confirmation of the discharge from Pele's press office in Brazil., (Reporting by Jean-Stéphane Brosse in Paris; Writing by Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paulo; Editing by Peter Cooney)
White House Welcomes College Football Champions With Fast-Food Buffet - The New York Times,"As is tradition, President Trump hosted the champions of college football, the Clemson Tigers, for a celebration of their athletic achievement at the White House on Monday.",The food he offered them was far less traditional.,"Piles of burgers and fish sandwiches from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King, still in their boxes and wrappers, were served on trays in the candlelit dining room. Tubs of dipping sauces were stacked in silver gravy boats. On another table, heat lamps kept French fries and Domino’s pizzas warm. Salads were available, too.","It was an opulent setting for fast-food fare. Visiting players are typically offered a meal from the White House kitchen, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the government shutdown necessitated a new menu.","“Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed — so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone’s favorite fast foods,” she said.","The substitution didn’t seem to bother Mr. Trump, and perhaps even delighted him.","“I like it all,” he told reporters before the players arrived. “It’s all good stuff. Great American food.”","Mr. Trump has long professed a love for fast food. He values its efficiency and consistency, and as a self-professed “germaphobe,” has said uniform health standards make him more confident in its cleanliness. He used to eat it several times per week.","He’s far from alone in loving fast food. About one-third of American adults eat fast food on any given day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Still, the sight of the fast-food cartons inside the stately White House dining room struck some observers on social media as incongruous — or lacking in hospitality for a celebration. (No players looked particularly dissatisfied as cameras rolled.)","It also promoted cuisine that nutritionists warn is high in calories, fat and sodium, and that increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases.","Such events, ostensibly a tribute to championship teams, are unavoidably political. Mr. Trump abruptly disinvited the N.F.L. champion Philadelphia Eagles last year after most of the players and coaches said they would boycott the visit. The Golden State Warriors declined to visit after winning the N.B.A. championship last year.","With reporters gathered before the players arrived, on a day he stayed inside the White House, Mr. Trump was eager to drive the discussion back to the weekslong government shutdown. After showing off the food spread, he pivoted to making his case for Republican unity and the need for the border wall.","“It should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it’s going to happen now, it’s going to happen now,” he said.","Without missing a beat, he continued: “Thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy your food.”"
What We Learned About College Football in the Past Season - The New York Times,"The 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.","Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.","Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.","College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.","Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.","The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).","“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.","For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.","It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.","Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.","College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.","The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.","But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.","Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.","Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.","Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.","Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way."
Tim Tebow Takes Another Step With the Mets (and Avoids Sprinklers This Time) - The New York Times,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Ed Hobson stood up in the bleachers along the first-base line at Field 7 in the Mets’ spring training facility Saturday morning, having driven 300 miles to monitor one man.","“Hoping to meet St. Timothy,” said Hobson, an assistant chief at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “We even have a four-foot alligator in front of our house. We named him Tebow because he’s the greatest Gator of all time.”","He was referring, of course, to Tim Tebow, the former football player and current Mets farmhand. Hobson, a University of Florida alumnus like Tebow, had never seen him in the flesh, but he wore a T-shirt emblazoned “Team Tebow.” Hobson’s 6-year-old son, Liam, wore a replica of Tebow’s old No. 15 Florida football jersey.","They were on a family pilgrimage. The night before, they hopped in a Honda Odyssey at their home near the Georgia coast to observe the latest stop on Tebow’s baseball journey. Father and son moved closer to the chain-link fence as Tebow made the first steps in his transition from a Class AA All-Star to training for the Syracuse Mets in Class AAA.","Tebow, 31, strode into this third spring training with a confident gait, intent on not repeating past missteps. Last February, Tebow failed to make it past a sprinkler head during drill work and sprained his ankle. The injury worsened as a result of Tebow’s refusal to rest, and he collected just one hit in 18 at-bats, all as a designated hitter, in seven spring games.","“I didn’t play one snap of outfield,” he said Saturday before catching his slip into football vernacular.","Forgive Tebow. In the gig economy, he has remained on the go. During the fall and winter, he returned to work as a college football analyst for ESPN. Still, he swung in batting cages on college campuses between on-camera appearances. On the day of the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, he performed his television duties in the morning, went to Tulane University for batting practice and then returned to the stadium for the game. In a suite, he discussed his swing with his hitting coach, Jay Gibbons, the former Dodger and Oriole who travels with Tebow.","“When you give me enough time, I’m going to just make up that ground, those tiny inches every day,” Tebow said. “That’s my mind-set: Just keep working; get a little bit better.”","Though Tebow has been out of the N.F.L. since 2015 — and had not appeared in a regular-season game since 2012 — football still calls. In recent weeks, Tebow turned down an offer to play for Coach Steve Spurrier’s Orlando Apollos in the Alliance of American Football, a nascent league populated with former N.F.L. players like Tebow, who played three seasons. Before reporting to Mets camp, Tebow also walked down the red carpet at the premiere of “Run the Race,” a faith-based movie he co-produced with his brother, Robby.","He maintained, though, that neither film nor football could lure him away from the diamond now.","“No way could I stop and not give this the chance after everything I’ve worked for,” he said. “This is what I’m in now, and I’m all in.”","Tebow commenced his latest campaign in the batting cage. He then ran down fly balls in the outfield, backpedaling and making over-the-shoulder catches. When he walked to home plate with his bat, he received hugs from Omar Minaya, the special assistant to the general manager; Brodie Van Wagenen, the general manager; and Fred Wilpon, the team owner. On pitch after pitch, Tebow, who batted .273 with the Class AA Binghamton Rumble Ponies last summer, turned his hips and connected with the ball. Seven of his hits cleared the right-field fence.","“It’s raw power,” Manager Mickey Callaway said. “It’s real. The bat moves through the zone pretty swiftly. He’s got to continue to work on handling certain zones, but he puts the barrel on the ball, and it goes a long way.”","Tebow also could not help but weigh in on the recent story that transcended both of his sports. While on assignment for ESPN, he met Kyler Murray, the Oklahoma quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy last season after being picked by Oakland in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft. Murray recently announced his decision to play football professionally, instead of baseball. Tebow, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, understood his position better than most.","“I think this was a really tough decision for him,” Tebow said. “He loves two sports, and I can really relate to that. And he went with something that he’s been really good at lately and dominating in. When we talked about it, and we did talk about that, I just gave him the advice to follow your heart. Whatever you’re passionate about.”","He recalled telling Murray: “You know what? Don’t do it for your agents, or your friends and sometimes necessarily even your family. Do it for what’s on your heart, and don’t let other people define you. You’re going to have all these coaches that you look up to and everybody else that’s going to tell you what they think, but what’s most important is following your heart and your passion.”",Reminders of Tebow’s past life greeted him on the other side of the fence after his first workout. One spectator held up a photo of him celebrating with football teammates at Florida. Another held out a Jets jersey with his No. 15 stitched into it. Tebow scrawled his signature for children as he tucked his yellow birch bat with “John 16:33” — a Scripture passage about taking heart and finding peace — marked on the barrel beneath his arm.,"Anticipation grew for Donna Taaffee, a fan, as she watched him approach.","“He’s getting closer!” she said. “Oh my goodness, he’s getting closer!”","Tebow smiled as he passed. He then shook the hand of Hobson, whose son held out a baseball and pen for Tebow to sign. Tebow obliged.","Hobson joked about catching up later on with Tebow, who recently got engaged to Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, the 2017 Miss Universe pageant winner.","“My co-worker and I are going to crash his wedding,” he said."
Will the Rose Bowl Stand in the Way of a Bigger College Football Playoff? - The New York Times,"PASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.","Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.","“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.","Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.","“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”",Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.,"On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.","“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”",It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.,"The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.","The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.","“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.","Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.","During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”","“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”",Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.,"Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”","Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”","He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.","Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.","The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.","To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.","That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.","But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.","Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.","For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.","“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”"
Jason Witten to Return to the Cowboys After a Year as a Broadcaster - The New York Times,"Jason Witten, the ironman Dallas Cowboys tight end who retired from the N.F.L. and joined “Monday Night Football” last year, announced Thursday that he would return to the team. By the time the season starts, he will be 37.","“The fire inside of me to compete and play this game is just burning too strong,” Witten said in a statement. “This team has a great group of rising young stars, and I want to help them make a run at a championship. This was completely my decision, and I am very comfortable with it. I’m looking forward to getting back in the dirt.”","The Cowboys were 10-6 last season with a wild-card playoff win. But their top tight end, Blake Jarwin, had only 307 receiving yards. Dallas missed the playoffs in Witten’s last season.","When Witten retired in May, he said of his decision, “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.”","He made 11 Pro Bowls, including the one in his final season, and caught 1,152 passes for 12,448 yards, both Cowboys records. He ranks fourth in the N.F.L. in career catches behind Jerry Rice, Tony Gonzalez and Larry Fitzgerald. He was also known as a strong run blocker.","Though he played 16 games in every season except his first, his statistics dipped in his final years. In his last season, he had 63 catches and 560 yards receiving, the lowest figures since his rookie season.","Witten signed a four-year, $29.6 million contract extension with the Cowboys in 2017 but retired just one year later and joined a reimagined “Monday Night Football” booth on ESPN. He worked alongside Joe Tessitore, the play-by-play voice; Anthony McFarland, an analyst; and Lisa Salters, who reported from the sidelines.","ESPN had hoped to replicate the magic happening at CBS. A year earlier, CBS had hired Witten’s quarterback with the Cowboys, Tony Romo, and made him the network’s lead football analyst. Romo was an instant hit and received near-universal praise for his ability to predict plays.","But from the start, the Tessitore, McFarland and Witten booth struggled. Witten often stumbled over his lines — his most notable moment was when he said that the N.F.L. had gone “left wing” in its protection of quarterbacks — and sometimes spoke in platitudes. McFarland, instead of sitting in the broadcast booth, provided commentary from an odd cranelike contraption on the sideline that ESPN called the Booger Mobile.","Witten’s performance was savaged by sports media critics, who wondered how long ESPN would keep the booth together. “‘Monday Night Football’ has a big problem: Jason Witten,” read one Boston Globe headline. Witten and Jay Rothman, the show’s producer, asked for patience, and Rothman insisted Witten’s job was safe.","In a statement Thursday, ESPN thanked Witten for his contributions and said, “We understand Jason’s desire to return to the Dallas Cowboys.”",ESPN said its plans for the 2019 “Monday Night Football” booth had not been determined.
"Forrest Gregg, Iron Man Lineman for Lombardi’s Packers, Dies at 85 - The New York Times","Forrest Gregg, one of the N.F.L.’s greatest offensive tackles and a key figure on Coach Vince Lombardi’s five Green Bay Packer championship teams of the 1960s, died on Friday in Colorado Springs. He was 85.","His wife, Barbara Gregg, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease, which Gregg announced that he had in 2011. He died in a hospital in Colorado Springs, where he also lived. After retiring as a player he had been the head coach of three N.F.L. teams.","At 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, Gregg was not especially large for an interior lineman of his era. But in his 15 N.F.L. seasons as a player — all with the Packers except for his final year — he proved a brilliant blocker, opening holes on Lombardi’s No.1 play, the sweep. He played in 188 consecutive games, a record at the time.",Lombardi called him “the finest player I ever coached.”,"Gregg personified a pro football warrior, memorably in an image captured by the sports photographer Robert Riger during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in 1960. In stark black and white, Gregg fills the frame, his face, chest and helmet caked with mud.","“Forrest Gregg looks like he is cast out of iron,” Lombardi said in recalling that photo for his book “Run to Daylight!” (1963), written with W. C. Heinz.","“It rained three days in a row before the game, and they tried to dry the field out with sand and all it did was make it muddier,” Gregg told the Pro Football Hall of Fame. “The mud had to be at least five inches deep on the field during the game. Of course, we won, so that made it better. The mud didn’t taste so bad.”","Slamming into the left defensive end with a forearm or shoulder, then moving to take out the opponent’s middle linebacker as the sweep play moved downfield, Gregg opened what the Packers called “daylight” for halfback Paul Hornung or fullback Jim Taylor, who ran behind the pulling guards. (Taylor died last October at 83.)","Playing at right tackle — and occasionally at right guard when Jerry Kramer, another Packer mainstay, was injured — Gregg was a first-team All-Pro seven times and selected for the Pro Bowl nine times. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in 1977, his first year of eligibility, and was named to the N.F.L.’s 75th anniversary team in 1994.","After his playing days, he coached the Cleveland Browns; the Cincinnati Bengals, whom he took to a Super Bowl; and the Packers.","Gregg was adept at moving his man with outstanding technique, buttressed by his study of film. But brute force sometimes prevailed when he teamed with tight end Ron Kramer on their blocks.","“Sometimes I’d come off and hit that defensive end, and then Ron would come down and hit him,” Gregg told Bob Carroll for his book “When the Grass Was Real” (1993). “You could feel that guy’s feet coming off the ground.”","Alvis Forrest Gregg was born on Oct. 18, 1933, in Birthright, Tex., a farming town about 90 miles northeast of Dallas. He was one of 11 children of Boyd and Josephine (Shirley) Gregg, who were farmers. He grew up in Sulphur Springs, Tex., about 10 miles from Birthright.","As a boy, Forrest was enthralled by football broadcasts. “I always knew I wanted to play after hearing the games on the radio,” he told The Chicago Tribune. He played football at Sulphur Springs High School and then at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.","Gregg was selected by the Packers as their second-round draft pick out of S.M.U. in 1956. After playing one season, he served a year in the Army, then returned to the Packers, who were transformed by Lombardi’s arrival in 1959.","Gregg played on Packer teams that won the 1961, 1962 and 1965 National Football League championships and the first two Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in January 1967 and the Oakland Raiders in January 1968, Lombardi’s last game as Packer coach. Gregg played a final season for the Dallas Cowboys team that won the 1972 Super Bowl, the team’s first, beating the Miami Dolphins.","He coached the Browns from 1975 to 1977, and the Bengals from 1980 to 1983, taking them to the 1982 Super Bowl, a 26-21 loss to the 49ers. He then replaced Bart Starr, the Packer quarterback in their glory years, as Green Bay’s coach. He coached the team from 1984 to 1987 but never had a winning season.","Gregg went back to S.M.U. in 1988 to revive a football program that had been banned for a year under the N.C.A.A.’s so-called death penalty for repeated rules violations. Resuming football in 1989, S.M.U. compiled a not surprising 3-19 record in Gregg’s two years as coach. He was the athletic director there for four years.","He married Barbara Dedek in 1960. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Forrest Jr.; a daughter, Karen Gregg Spehar; and several siblings.","Gregg was a quiet sort, but when angered he was one of the few Packers who stood up to Lombardi’s legendary intimidation.","The former Packer center Bill Curry told of the time Lombardi went into a tirade in 1965 after a late-season loss to a weak Los Angeles Rams team, shouting, “I’m the only one who gives a damn if we win or lose!”",Lombardi was taken aback by what came next.,"“There was Forrest Gregg on his feet, bright red, with a player on either side, holding him back by each arm, and he was straining forward,” Curry related in the book “One More July” (1977), written with George Plimpton. “Lombardi looked at him and stopped.”","“‘Scuse the language, Coach,’ ” Gregg fired back, ‘but it makes me sick to hear you say something like that. We lay it on the line for you every Sunday. We live and die the same way you do, and it hurts.’ ”","As Curry recalled it, Gregg “began straining forward again, trying to get up there to punch Lombardi out.”","Gregg’s challenge to Lombardi inspired a few teammates to confront him as well, and soon the other players joined in, insisting that they had a will to win.","As Curry noted, “We did not lose another game that year.”"
The Year the N.F.L. Bounced Back - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — After the N.F.L.’s best season in years, Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, got his chance to crow on Wednesday afternoon ahead of its showcase event.","“This season has demonstrated that there has never been a better time to be a part of the N.F.L.,” Goodell said. “Our game is getting better and better, and our engagement and popularity is unmatched in today’s media landscape.”","Under Goodell, the N.F.L. has tried to be everywhere all the time. The combine, the draft and the minicamps have become manufactured events unto themselves; there are now games on Thursday nights and some, played in London, early on Sunday mornings; and most games have remained on network television even as other sports have largely moved their games to cable and now streaming.","A year ago, the strategy was under stress. Then the emergence of a new crop of young stars and a largely controversy-free season combined to drive up television ratings and produce a spectacular weekend of conference championships, capping a winning streak that began with a surprisingly fervent auction for rights to the league’s least popular slate of games.","Coming off the 2017 season, after television ratings had dropped 17 percent over the previous two years, the league entered the media market trying to sell the rights to “Thursday Night Football.” CBS and NBC had both said they lost money showing Thursday games, and they weren’t willing to pay much more than the $450 million combined they were paying each year.","Then, as in 1993, when an audacious bid for N.F.L. rights ignited a scramble that sent their value soaring, Rupert Murdoch came to the rescue. Fox agreed to pay $660 million annually to show “Thursday Night Football.”","Murdoch’s market-resetting bid came shortly after he agreed to sell the vast majority of his empire to Disney, leaving him with a significant need for marquee programming on his network. Also, there was real competition from a tech company.","Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s chief media and business officer, said in an interview in September that Fox did not submit the highest bid. A tech company did, he said, though he would not reveal which one.","“We turned down higher bids,” he said. “When you put a game exclusively on digital, are you growing the distribution and availability, or are you limiting it, and to the extent how much? And for us, we weren’t sure we wanted to do that yet.”","In other words, the N.F.L. stuck to its foundational game plan to be everywhere and accessible. After two seasons of turmoil, the league opted not to break away from its longstanding strategy, but instead doubled down on it.","Plenty of dangers still lurk. Football’s concussion crisis threatens the viability of youth football. Colin Kaepernick’s collusion case against the league drags on, suggesting he has a chance to win, and attendance was down to its lowest level in eight seasons. Instead of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady or Rams Coach Sean McVay, the biggest topic ahead of the Super Bowl remains atrocious officiating. The league’s collective bargaining agreement with its players expires in two years, and negotiations will be tough.","But Rolapp’s big bet paid off. Every time slot for N.F.L. games, including Thursday night’s, earned higher television ratings this season, a total gain of 5 percent.",Incidents of violence against women continued to plague the league. The Kansas City Chiefs cut the Pro Bowl running back Kareem Hunt during the season after video showed him shoving and kicking a woman. The New York Times later reported that the N.F.L. failed to question Hunt about the incident during an interview earlier in the year.,"The San Francisco 49ers cut Reuben Foster after his second arrest on domestic violence charges in 2018, and three days later he was claimed by Washington, a move that garnered substantial criticism. TMZ also published video of Washington safety Montae Nicholson punching out a man.","But Goodell and the N.F.L. limited their unforced errors. There was nothing like the drawn-out legal battle over deflated footballs in 2015 and 2016. And once the N.F.L. realized the opposition it would face if it pushed ahead with a rule mandating players on the field to stand during the national anthem, the league backed off.","Young players like Patrick Mahomes, Baker Mayfield, Mitchell Trubisky and Saquon Barkley became stars in 2018, pointing the way to a post-Brady world. High-profile quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck returned to form. High-octane passing offenses took over the league.","It all came together in the conference championship games, which featured the four highest seeds and the four highest-scoring teams. Two veteran quarterbacks, Drew Brees and Brady, took on the best young quarterbacks, Jared Goff and Mahomes, in high-scoring shootouts that went to overtime.","David Berson, the president of CBS Sports, which will televise the Super Bowl on Sunday, said fewer off-the-field stories were getting attention “because the on-field product is so compelling.” Whether Berson is correct or whether the league simply had a year with fewer controversies ultimately does not matter all that much to the league’s media partners because, as Berson put it, “The focus is on the football, and the football is really exciting.”","There were blown calls and rules controversies, of course. The N.F.C. championship game hinged on an egregious no-call, and Brady and the Patriots also benefited from a questionable ruling and a rule that did not allow Mahomes — probably the league’s most valuable player — to get his hands on the football in overtime. But the arguments garnered more attention for the game, which was just what the league wanted.","The question now is whether this fundamentally violent sport can be made safer. Before the season, the N.F.L. introduced a rule barring players from using their helmets as weapons when tackling. Six weeks into the season, its enforcement was essentially abandoned, underscoring how difficult it is to legislate between acceptable and unacceptable levels of violence.","According to league statistics, concussions were down 29 percent in 2018, to 0.5 per game from 0.7. Jeff Miller, the N.F.L.’s executive vice president for health and safety, cautioned on a recent conference call that “there is no finishing line” when it comes to player safety, but touted the work being done to get players to wear better helmets and to present teams with targeted interventions to prevent concussions.","The league’s own concussion data show that the number of concussions each year fluctuates, and that previous reductions were reversed in following seasons. The N.F.L. has also not been able to reduce the instances of A.C.L. and M.C.L. tears, ligament injuries that commonly end players’ seasons.","The youth tackle football participation rate has been dropping for a decade, and now the high school tackle football participation rate is declining, too. Just one insurance company is willing to cover professional football leagues for head trauma, according to ESPN, and youth football leagues and school districts are facing insurance premiums that they are struggling to afford.","In the off-season, the N.F.L. is likely to receive a ruling in the Kaepernick collusion case. His grievance, which was filed 15 months ago, still hasn’t been heard. It remains difficult for collusion to be proven, but if Kaepernick wins, he could be awarded tens of millions of dollars, and evidence uncovered in discovery and depositions could become public.","Attendance in 2018 fell to its lowest level since 2011. This drop will be rectified in part in 2020 when the Los Angeles Chargers move from a 27,000-capacity soccer stadium to a 70,000-capacity football stadium, but Washington, Tampa Bay and Cincinnati all suffered big drops.","The N.F.L. operates on two planes: the day-to-day of small crises and opportunities, and the issues that could take a bite out of the $15 billion-a-year league. Most things fall into the first bucket, with no chance of harming a league whose revenue inches upward each season because of television contracts signed earlier in this decade.","Over the next decade, the N.F.L.’s ability to handle the changing media and technology environment and the mounting health and safety challenges is likely to determine whether it reaches its goal of $25 billion a year in revenue by 2027 and remains at the pinnacle of American sports.","Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons, is confident the league will continue to prosper. He believes the N.F.L. will receive even more money when contracts to telecast Sunday and Monday games expire after the 2021 and 2022 seasons because of “the number of ways the product is distributed these days,” he said.","But the root of Blank’s confidence is the league’s longstanding strategy. “The core of it is still going to be over-the-air free television,” he said. “That’s not going to change.”"
"Gronk Cruises Away from N.F.L., Leaving a Big Hole - The New York Times","There have been a host of terrific nicknames in football history, but has there ever been one better than Gronk?","Yes, it’s simply the abbreviation of a last name, but in this case it seemed to symbolize the essence of the player: a no-nonsense syllable as forceful as a crunching block to seal the end on a sweep, as dynamic as a leaping touchdown grab over a hapless defender.","Gronk even sounds whimsical or playful, which could not be more fitting.","The man behind the nickname, New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, announced his retirement on Sunday. At 6-foot-6 and nearly 270 pounds, he always seemed larger than life, but nine years in the N.F.L. will cut anyone down to size. After he had surgeries to his back, arm and knee, even a great nickname couldn’t save Gronk, who gingerly, and wisely, walked away weeks before his 30th birthday.",Everyone from his teammates to the Patriots’ hierarchy hurriedly lobbed praise at one of the best tight ends to play the game. And a league lacking in colorful characters suddenly has one fewer.,"Wide receiver Julian Edelman referred to Gronkowski as, “the other goat” (as in, greatest of all time). Coach Bill Belichick celebrated Gronkowski’s “unmistakably positive energy.” Tom Brady, in an Instagram post directed at Gronkowski, said the Patriots were “almost unbeatable when you were on the field.”","Indeed, Gronkowski transformed the position, an achievement that will one day make him a certain Hall of Fame inductee. It wasn’t just Gronkowski’s uncommon mix of size and speed; he played with an inimitable combination of acrobatic athleticism and reckless abandon.","With Gronkowski scoring 79 touchdowns in his career, it’s hard to single out one that typified his style of play, but a 19-yard catch-and-run against the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011, Gronkowski’s second season, revealed the kind of mettle he brought to every snap.","Lined up in the backfield, Gronkowski grabbed a 1-yard pass from Brady, then stormed up the right sideline, where he evaded three tacklers and vaulted toward the goal line. While in the air, a low hit flipped him upside down, but he still kept his forward momentum, landing precariously in the end zone on the back of his neck. Gronk wobbled to his feet, then performed his signature spiking of the football.",The Patriots won 34-3.,"And then there were the off-the-field antics. He danced on the field and on concert stages, chugged beers thrown to him during victory parades, impishly mugged for cameras behind the back of President Obama when the Patriots were feted at the White House. There were television and movie appearances, major roles in pro wrestling extravaganzas, and party after party where Gronk always seemed to materialize in character as the eternal goofball.","Along the way, Gronkowski’s colorful personality brought life to the button-down Patriots and N.F.L.","That kind of energy will be hard to replace. With pun intended, today the N.F.L. feels a little deflated.","Gronkowski’s retirement may also signal another beginning of the end for the Patriots’ ever-expanding reign. It always seems like folly to forecast the impending demise of the Brady-Belichick Patriots. But Gronkowski was unlike any other tight end, and he leaves a gaping hole for New England.","It is true that the Patriots’ offense is notable for how it can morph week to week and season to season. Still, stellar tight end play has been a constant to Belichick’s success, and in Gronkowski, the coach had a weapon who could be a devastating blocker, a third-down possession receiver and a downfield threat mixed into one.",Good luck finding another talent like that before Brady’s career concludes.,"Gronkowski’s unmatched value was on full display in his last football game, the Super Bowl against the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots’ offense was hopelessly out of sync as drive after drive stalled short of scoring. To provide stability, New England turned to its running game, with Gronkowski’s punishing blocks often leading the way.","Then, near the midpoint of the fourth quarter, with the game tied, the Patriots ran the same play three times in a row. It was primarily a pass play, but because Gronkowski was one of two tight ends in the huddle before each snap, the Rams had to defend the threat of a rushing attempt by leaving their base defense on the field. That meant one fewer defensive back to cover Gronkowski if he dashed downfield.","Which is what happened. On the last of the three plays, Gronkowski shifted into the slot like a wide receiver and the Patriots had the mismatch they sought when Rams linebacker Cory Littleton trotted over — at the last second — to cover Gronkowski.","As he had so many times before, Brady lofted a precise pass into a small opening in the defense and Gronkowski dove to make the catch inside the Rams’ 5-yard line.","On the next play, Gronkowski sealed the left end with a powerful block on defensive end John Franklin-Myers, and running back Sony Michel dashed just off Gronkowski’s right hip for the go-ahead score in the Patriots’ 13-3 victory.","Gronkowski briefly celebrated with teammates in the end zone after the score. Then he slowly, and somewhat laboriously, jogged off the field.","About 20 minutes later, the Patriots were draped in confetti at midfield with music blaring along a makeshift stage. Belichick turned at one point and yelled, “Gronk!”","Duly summoned, Gronkowski grinned at his coach, who smiled back and said: “You’re a hell of a player.”"
Gang Green? Now the Jets Are Gang (Gotham) Green - The New York Times,"The Jets, a football team that has been an N.F.L. punch line for years, asked a comedian to be the master of ceremonies at a loud, flashy event to unveil the team’s new uniforms on Thursday.","J.B. Smoove, who has been a suffering Jets fan for decades, stood on the stage at Gotham Hall in Manhattan and urged the star players who were modeling the new threads to wear them proudly and become accustomed to them.","“Get comfortable,” Smoove said to quarterback Sam Darnold. “These are your damn pajamas.”","When a team finishes last in three consecutive seasons, and has not made the playoffs in eight, sometimes the best approach is to make cosmetic changes and laugh about it. This, after all, is a team that counts “The Butt Fumble” among its most memorable moments of the last several years, so maybe a change was in order.","Yet, aside from Smoove, the Jets were very serious — even solemn, at times — about this new endeavor, treating the unveiling of the new uniform at an event space on Broadway much the way a major tech company introduces a fancy new device.","There was a D.J., flashing lights, a celebratory video, cheerleaders and, of course, fans chanting J-E-T-S. It was as close as the Jets get to a parade these days.","They said that work on the new uniforms began in 2014, which is a long time for anything to do with fashion. Christopher Johnson, the chairman and chief executive, quipped that it took longer to come up with the new duds than it did to build the team’s current stadium in New Jersey.","But he noted that it was the perfect moment for a new look. The Jets, who were 4-12 last year, have a new coach, Adam Gase; a talented, second-year quarterback in Darnold; and several other new players, including the star running back Le’Veon Bell. The new uniforms, he said hopefully, signaled a new era for Gang Green.","There was also talk of “brand identity” and a “refreshed logo,” the kind of marketing jargon that all teams use when they hope fans will buy items with the new look. (Within minutes of the unveiling, the new uniforms were featured on the home page of the N.F.L.’s website and its shop.) There was even a reference to work on the new design being “an extraordinary process,” as if it included some historic feat of engineering.","“You will see the vision behind the process, including the thought, energy and excitement it took to make this change a reality,” Johnson said. “Our fans asked for this change. So did our players. It was time for a new uniform, time for a new look.”","That look that fans allegedly asked for consists of a brand-new color (if that is possible) that the Jets call Gotham Green. Besides sounding like a name for a small park in Manhattan, the tint looks like a slight variation of the green it replaced.","A more significant change is the new black uniform, with a hue dubbed Stealth Black, that all the players seemed to like a lot.","Gone are the trademark vertical stripes on the shoulders. They were swapped out for pointy horizontal stripes that come around the shoulders and aim underneath the neckline, toward the center N.F.L. logo, which sits above the words “New York” in capital letters. It is becoming ever more popular for teams to put their nicknames on jerseys, but the city of origin is not common.","The pants, both white (make that Spotlight White) and green, have the same kind of pointy stripes made popular when the Denver Broncos changed their uniform design in 1997. The straight dual stripes that gave the previous Jets uniforms a classic flavor are gone, and with them goes the traditional old logo, too.","The Jets traded in the white helmet and the green NY logo that dates back, with slight variations, to the days of Joe Namath and Don Maynard. (Broadway Joe, by the way, was right there on Broadway on Thursday to sanction all the changes.)","The new helmet is shiny (Gotham) green with a white logo that has the word “Jets” above a small football, a nod to the football in the old logo. (The Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the only teams with a football in their helmet logos.)","When the players, including Jamal Adams, Leonard Williams, Quincy Enunwa and Darnold, were brought on stage to showcase the new look, they danced and posed and later echoed the team line that the new look is bold, innovative and fresh.","“I think that a lot of old school people are going to have it grow on them,” Enunwa said and added, “It feels like a new team, in a way.”","That is the point. But the Jets are only the most recent N.F.L. team to change uniforms. Some have had more success than others. The Patriots changed their uniforms in 2000, and in their second season in a darker blue color, they won the first of six Super Bowls in them.","“I think that’s just a coincidence,” Darnold said. “But no, maybe it’s a telltale sign. If we don’t play well, the uniforms are going to look crummy. If we play well, then they are going to look awesome.”"
"After an N.F.L. Career, Keith Rivers Is Exploring Another Field - The New York Times","“Art gave me something to segue into,” said Keith Rivers, a former N.F.L. linebacker, at his art-filled house in Beverly Hills. “I’ve really gotten serious as far as studying, going to shows, going to all the museums I can.”","Mr. Rivers, who is 32, is throwing himself into art and culture in a way few people can. He plans to move to Paris this summer and use it as a base of operations for an immersive year of learning that will include studying French and trying to visit every art museum in Europe. “That will be my art history,” he said.","In the meantime, for research, he has a tall stack of old art magazines and catalogs flagged with Post-its that he referred to frequently during a recent conversation about his collection.","During his rookie season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2009, Mr. Rivers bought his first piece — an Andy Warhol Electric Chair print — after a trip to the Museum of Modern Art with a woman he had been interested in when he was studying at the University of Southern California. “She was an art history major and explained Oldenburg to me,” he said. “I got curious.” She married someone else, but the curiosity remained.","Since he retired from football in 2015, after also having played for the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills, Mr. Rivers has deepened his pursuit of contemporary art and owns work by Rashid Johnson, Kerry James Marshall, Kara Walker, Tony Lewis, Sonia Gomes and Arjan Martins, among others.","Works with strong graphic punch dominate his walls. Raised eyebrows and furrowed foreheads peer from a large piece by John Baldessari. A text-based canvas by Barbara Kruger proclaims, “You drive a hard bargain.” Glenn Ligon’s hot pink and yellow lettering on a red canvas spells out a Richard Pryor joke. In a Cyprien Gaillard piece, the cartoon face of Chief Wahoo — the logo of the Cleveland Indians — is superimposed on a pristine American landscape.","“It calls out the paradox of rooting for this mascot, a caricature of a Native American, and how outdated caricatures live on through marketing,” Mr. Rivers said.","“So many guys get done with football, and they have nothing; that became their sole identity,” he said. Art has “given me a whole new structure.”",These are edited excerpts from the conversation.,Why did you give up football?,"I’d been injured a lot. My interest was shifting toward things like art. If you’re not fully into football, it’s not the sport to play because you can really get hurt.",How did you initially get interested in art?,"In high school, a girlfriend of mine was in a photography class. She’d pull me out of class sometimes to go take photos. In 2017, I was walking in Amsterdam with that same friend, who lives there, and she reminded me of that fact. I almost cried. I said, “Oh my God, you planted a seed for this passion.”",How would you define the focus of your collection?,At the moment I’m drawn toward art that has political meaning because of the times that we’re in. Issues of identity and language are highly important to me. There’s an element of race in the collection.,"That [canvas spelling out the date “Mar.3.1991”] is by Juan Capistrán, who was raised in South-Central. It is done in pig’s blood and is Rodney King day.","John Edmonds does this “Hoods” series, which I just had to have. I grew up about 5 to 10 minutes away from Trayvon Martin’s murder. You can’t see anybody’s face in these photographs. With a hood, you don’t know who anyone could be from the back.","Do you do a lot of research before you buy, or do you go with your gut?","A little bit of both, depending on the price. Like the Glenn Ligon, I did extensive research for the best work that I could obtain. This is Lubaina Himid, the first black woman and the oldest person to win the Turner Prize. I had read about her in The New York Times, and then when I was at Basel [the art fair] this year, a friend came up and said, “You’ve got to come see this artist.” I was able to buy it quickly because something clicked.",Are you involved with museums in any formal role?,I’m on the executive committee for the Young Patrons Group at the Hammer Museum. It’s an opportunity to get people who are interested in art but may be intimidated. This is a great group to tear down some of those walls.
How to Tackle Someone - The New York Times,"“If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldn’t hit that door with your head,” says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. “Keep your head and neck out of the equation,” Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.","Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground — if you’re slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. “Your power comes from your legs and feet,” Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponent’s thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxer’s. Maintain momentum after contact.","Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. “The technique is not skill-specific, and it’s not age-specific,” Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isn’t just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: “Some coaches love winning so much they’re willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad they’re willing to lose.”"
A Giant Laid Low by Too Many Blows to the Head - The New York Times,"DENVER — Tall and imposing, indomitable even, 6-foot-8 with shoulders and a back broad enough to push a pickup truck.","He was a star lineman on a state championship team in high school and for the University of Colorado Buffaloes, where he set a team record for starts and minutes played. He was an Associated Press third-team all-American and played three years in the N.F.L.",Yet the word that jumps most quickly to mind when talking to Ryan Miller is “fragile.”,"Hits, concussive and subconcussive, have laid him low. Head bursting, nausea rising, please shut off the lights, please. I interviewed Miller twice, our talks separated by 22 months, and he is doing better, which is not to suggest this thoughtful and soft-spoken 29-year-old is anywhere near what he wants to be.","When I met him in 2017 Miller had spent the previous hour in a darkened room, breathing slowly. He would get into his car and sit for hours, trying to remember where he intended to go. He would walk into airports, and lights and noise and crowds made him want to curl into a fetal ball. Since then he has gotten better with therapy and diet, and he has lost a lot of weight. He’s healthier, and yet. …","“I don’t live as much in fear of what will happen next, and it’s been a year since I have had a seizure,” he told me. “It’s been a long road. It still is a long road.”","The brutality of the N.F.L. and its malefactions and lack of care for players’ bodies and minds are well known. But the time a player spends in college, including Miller’s tenure in the savage trenches of an offensive line, wreaks great damage, too, and that raises a pointed question: How can universities, places of higher learning that are devoted to the development of young minds and that in some cases spend millions of dollars researching the ill effects of brain injuries, justify running multimillion-dollar football machines that put those brains at risk of lifelong damage?","The University of Colorado is in measurable ways better on health than some top-ranked college programs. Yet former Buffaloes players have suffered brain and emotional damage, and some have taken their own lives. The roll call of the Colorado dead includes running back Rashaan Salaam, at age 42; linebacker Drew Wahlroos, 37; and tight end Tennyson McCarty, 32. Much evidence points to the likelihood that these men suffered emotional and cognitive problems as a result of too many hits. Wahlroos’s brain was donated to the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy center. Results have not yet been released. ","Some Colorado regents have begun to ask questions. “Football as played in America is a brutal 19th century sport that is highly destructive to the human brain,” Linda Shoemaker told fellow regents. “I don’t believe it has a place in the academic enterprise that is the University of Colorado.”","I will return tomorrow to their challenge to the college football industry. Today the focus is on a man consumed with a search to feel normal again. I first found my way to Miller’s suburban home southwest of Denver, the snow-capped Rockies glimmering in the distance, after reading about him in The Denver Post in 2017.","He hails from an athletic family and took up tackle football in grade school. He adored it, the running, the playmaking, the hitting. Robert Cantu, a doctor who helped start the C.T.E. Center at Boston University, studies the brain health of athletes and says the risk of emotional and cognitive damage is three times higher for those N.F.L. players who played tackle before age 12.","Miller played continuously until, as a 285-pound teenager, he became the core of a legendary high school offensive line, the “Great Wall of Columbine.”","“To have size and weight and skill advantages over all those poor high school kids, man,” he said. “I don’t want to toot my horn, but we were talented.”","He smiled distantly at old conceits. “Yeah, well. You reap what you sow, right?”","By which he meant he reaped lots of head whacks for years on end. He had at least one concussion in high school. “I sat out a day or two and played the next week,” he said.","Miller has had 10 concussions in all, and that is to understate his battering. The brain sits in fluid inside the armor of a skull, and even nonconcussive whacks can result in brain colliding with bone. A couple of hard hits can come to resemble a concussion. The average football player, according to Cantu, takes 600 to 800 hits in high school and 800 to 1,000 in college.","The Buffaloes were not highly ranked, but Miller faced off against young men no less big and strong, many of whom went on to pro careers. He played 2,548 snaps, missing a total of two in three years. And that’s not to mention practices and spring football. Did he get concussed? He shrugs. “A couple. It didn’t feel great.” Another pause. “I mean, I always played the next game.”","Miguel Rueda, the University of Colorado’s associate athletic director, said graduating players are given a medical work-up, including a session with a doctor. That’s fine. But those who study concussions speak of a cumulative toll, like a woodpecker tap-tapping at a skull.",You don’t know you’re in trouble until one day. …,"The Cleveland Browns drafted Miller 160th over all. A year later he was in summer drills, took a hit and fell to the turf as if shot. He lay motionless and unconscious for five minutes before being strapped to a gurney and taken to the hospital.","“It took me six months to feel normal again,” he said.","The Browns cut him loose, and he became an itinerant lineman, signing with San Diego, Denver and Dallas. He was in the Cowboys camp when it happened again, on a move he had made a thousand times before. “Face to face,” he says. “A normal hit, just like in high school or college.”","That night he called his wife and bawled hysterically, hung up and began to vomit. He quivered, unable to stand, unable to see. “My head felt the most incredible pressure, like lava and sulfur coming out of my ears. It was like someone was hitting me with an anvil. I wanted to die. I thought I was dying.”","Miller began a trek to doctor’s offices. “Doctors said one more hit like that and you might not wake up,” he said. “A lifetime was catching up to me.” ","He was denied disability benefits. He had sustained concussions at the University of Colorado, with the Browns and the Cowboys. But how to put a finger on the fateful hit?",University of Colorado officials spoke to me of their hope to make a safer helmet. Would that have helped? ,"Miller sighed. “You just become a better missile,” he said."," He’s not a college football abolitionist, not quite. He loved the camaraderie and the strategy and the athleticism even as he knows the bottom line. “You are there to make money for the university. You are a lesser priced whore.”","Our talk turns to his future. Miller has announced plans to donate his brain to the Boston University concussion center. But that’s no morbid flag of surrender; he plans to climb out of this hole. He sounds hopeful, sort of.","“There’s still quite a few blank pages. I don’t tell the same story seven times over,” he said. “Some days I feel like a young man, and some days not.”"
Opinion | What Time Is the A.F.C. Championship Game? - The New York Times,"I’m pleased that the New England Patriots made it to the A.F.C. championship game again this year. On Sunday, they’ll play the Kansas City Chiefs at 6:40 p.m., and the winner will advance to the Super Bowl.","I’ve been a Patriots fan my entire life, long before they were good enough to loathe. But I won’t be watching football this weekend. I haven’t watched a single pass or tackle all season.",I don’t remember much about last year’s A.F.C. championship game between the Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars. But I’ll never forget the sound.,"The Pats were down 14-3 with 1:23 left in the second quarter when the tight end Rob Gronkowski tried to catch a long, lofted pass from the quarterback, Tom Brady. ",He almost had it. ,"But the Jags’ safety, Barry Church, hit Mr. Gronkowski just as he was pulling it down.",Their hard plastic helmets hit each other with such force that — even through the tinny speakers on my television — it sounded like a rifle shot. You can see and hear the collision here.,It still echoes in my ears. ,"As the sound of the hit faded into a commercial break, I realized with absolute certainty that I couldn’t watch football anymore. There aren’t enough yards to gain or Super Bowl rings to win that are worth the cost.","To use a euphemism from the era before we knew about brain damage, Mr. Gronkowski “got his bell rung.” Shaken by the impact, he struggled to his feet, wobbled and was helped off the field with a concussion. Mr. Church was fined $24,309 by the N.F.L. for an illegal hit.","“I hope he’s all right,” Mr. Church said after the game. “If you go low for the knees, you are considered a dirty player, and if you go high, they throw the flag at you. It’s a bang-bang play, and I was just trying to play football.”","“It’s football,” Mr. Gronkowski later told the press. “It is what it is.”",And that’s the problem.,"The first research into the link between football and traumatic brain injury was published in 2005. Since then, the science has become impossible to ignore. ","In 2017, The Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of the autopsies of the brains of 111 deceased former N.F.L. players, whose relatives gave their bodies up for study. The group was not a random sample, yet 110 showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to concussions. Research published in November estimated that a minimum of 10 percent of all professional football players would develop C.T.E. at some point in their lives. ",Professional athletes are well compensated for their dangerous job. But the pipeline is a problem. It can take more than a decade of hard hits to make it to a college team or the pros.,"Research published in The Journal of Pediatrics last month found that concussion rates for youth football players were higher than previously reported. In all, some 5 percent of all youth football players receive concussions each year, a figure that may sound low, but compounds with each additional year of play. In 2017, a study found that playing football before age 12 doubled the risk of problems with behavioral regulation, apathy and executive functioning. It tripled the risk of elevated depression.","It’s little wonder that lawmakers last year in New York, Illinois, California, Maryland and New Jersey introduced bills to ban or restrict youth tackle football.","All this isn’t the snowflaking of the next generation of American men. It’s physics. Technology — in the form of, say, better helmets — will not save the game. Researchers note that helmets don’t prevent all concussions and might be making the problem worse, by giving players a false sense of invincibility.","The dangers of the game are clear to the insurance companies that cover youth and professional leagues. An investigation published by ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” this week found that the insurance market for youth football is “fundamentally altering the economics of the sport, squeezing and even killing off programs faced with higher costs and a scarcity of available coverage.”","“People say football will never go away, but if we can't get insurance, it will,” Jon Butler, the executive director of the youth football program Pop Warner, is reported to have said. ",The report said that the N.F.L. is also having problems finding companies willing to insure against head injuries.,"With no safe way to play — short of flag football — it’s little wonder that participation in youth football is on the decline. Some high schools have dropped the sport altogether, while state legislatures are passing and updating concussion laws to ensure schools that do field teams take the issue seriously. Every state now has a concussion law on the books.","Nor is it surprising that some younger N.F.L. players are calling it quits. Mr. Gronkowski, now 29, reportedly considered retirement after last season. Reports say he’s considering doing so after this one, too.","There are still Newton deniers, who contest his laws of physics, which explain how the human brain slams into the interior walls of the skull during a concussion.","“Your body gets used to the hits,” the Patriots’ Tom Brady told a sports radio show last month. “The brain understands the position that you are putting your body into, and my brain is wired for contact. I would say in some ways it has become callous to some of the hits.”","Mr. Brady’s former teammate, Ted Johnson, spent 10 years in the N.F.L. and told The Times in 2007, at age 34, that he was suffering from symptoms characteristic of early Alzheimer’s disease as a results of concussions. “There's something wrong with my brain,” he said.",Mr. Johnson called Mr. Brady’s recent remarks about concussions “irresponsible.” ,"“I’ll be honest, and I love Tom, it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit,” he said.","Despite all these concerns, there’s little indication that football will be dethroned as America’s favorite sport. Television ratings, which have taken some hard hits of their own over the past few years, have rebounded this season. And the Super Bowl might be the most communal experience the country has in 2019.","This Sunday, I won’t begrudge my father, who’ll watch the game delayed on DVR, so he doesn’t have to endure commercials to get to the 11 minutes of action. Nor my cousin, who’ll bet money on the game. Seeing the occasional Patriots hat or jersey on the street is a nice reminder of the tribe I’ve parted ways with. ","Because as long as I can hear the sound of Gronk getting his bell rung, I’ll find something else to watch. "
Russell Wilson Becomes N.F.L.’s Highest Paid Player - The New York Times,"RENTON, Wash. — Russell Wilson is sticking around with the Seattle Seahawks as the highest paid player in the N.F.L.","Wilson posted a video on social media early Tuesday saying, “Seattle, we got a deal,” shortly after agreeing to a $140 million, four-year extension with the Seahawks, his agent Mark Rodgers said. Wilson’s new deal runs through the 2023 season and includes a $65 million signing bonus, a no-trade clause and $107 million in guaranteed money.",Wilson’s per year average of $35 million tops Aaron Rodgers’s average annual salary of $33.5 million as part of the $134 million extension he signed last year with the Green Bay Packers.,"Wilson’s current $87.6 million, four-year deal was signed at the beginning of training camp in 2015 and was set to expire after next season.","“Russell’s goal and his hope was that he would continue his career with the Seahawks and continue to bring championships to this town,” Mark Rodgers, his agent, said. “He believes there is still unfinished business, and he is looking forward to pursuing that without having to worry about contracts and his future.”","Wilson, 30, had set a midnight deadline for a new deal with Seattle. He wanted certainty about his contract before the start of the team’s off-season workout program, which began on Monday. Wilson showed up for the first day, and by the end of the night was posting a video with wife, Ciara, announcing the agreement.","The deal ends the debate about Wilson’s future with the Seahawks, although there seemed to be little doubt he would remain in Seattle for a while. The team held leverage knowing it most likely had at least three more seasons with Wilson under center. Even if he played out 2019 under his current deal, Seattle could have used the franchise tag if needed to keep him under contract through 2020 and 2021 at a reasonable price by quarterback standards.",But the extension allows Seattle to budget for the future knowing how to work with Wilson’s hefty paycheck in the years ahead and build a contender around him.,"Wilson was the second-highest paid player in football behind Rodgers when his deal was signed in 2015, but had fallen to the 12th highest-paid quarterback in the league, according to Overthecap.com.","Wilson is coming off arguably his best season as Seattle went a surprising 10-6 and earned an N.F.C. wild card before losing to Dallas in the opening round of the playoffs. It was supposed to be a rebuilding year, but the Seahawks were ahead of schedule thanks to their return to a run-first offense and Wilson’s exceptional performance when tasked to throw.","The 5-foot-11 Wilson threw for a career-high 35 touchdowns and matched his career low with seven interceptions. He attempted only 427 passes — his lowest total since his second season when Seattle won the Super Bowl — but his efficiency was a career best with a 110.9 passer rating. He also ran only 67 times, a career low, as the improved run game and offensive line play allowed Wilson to stay in the pocket more and scramble for his life less.","It was a stark change from the 2017 season when Seattle missed the playoffs for the first time under Wilson. He led the league in touchdown passes, but also was Seattle’s leading rusher because of a nonexistent run game.","The idea of Wilson leaving Seattle has always seemed a stretch. Teams do not usually give up on quarterbacks with the kind of success he has had. Wilson has led the Seahawks to the playoffs in six of his seven seasons, the only miss coming in 2017 when Seattle finished 9-7. He won a Super Bowl in his second season and got back to the championship game a year later before making the one major mistake of his career that will linger until he wins another title, throwing a goal line interception in the final minute when the Seahawks had a chance to take the lead on New England.","Wilson has shelved the stigma of short quarterbacks being unable to play in the N.F.L. He’s also been extremely durable, never missing a game while playing through significant knee, ankle and shoulder injuries."
"Long Before Alabama, the South Had Sewanee - The New York Times","Long before Alabama — and now Clemson — rose as proud football powers, the 1899 University of the South football team, familiarly known as the Sewanee Tigers, provided a blueprint for Southern college football domination. ","Alabama and Clemson would surely crush the Tigers, but the copyright for how to dominate an era of college football would probably belong to Sewanee, not Alabama or its opponent in Monday night’s national championship game, Clemson.",[Alabama vs. Clemson: Follow our live coverage from the national championship game],The idealization of the football player in the South? The idea of tying a Southern university’s identity to football? They go back at least as far as Sewanee. The pursuit of money to keep a college football program greased for greatness? That is another trademark at least 119 years old.,"The Crimson Tide can capture their sixth national title in 10 years with a win over Clemson on Monday in Santa Clara, Calif. Clemson beat Alabama two years ago, and this is the third time the two teams have met for the championship in four years.","But Sewanee, Tenn., a small town on the Cumberland Plateau, created the template for the flush, modern, Southern football powerhouse, and it has been used time and again in the past 60 years, reaching its apotheosis at Alabama under Coach Nick Saban. ","Sewanee was led by one of the first forward thinkers of Southern football, Luke Lea (pronounced LEE), its 22-year-old team manager. The equivalent of an athletic director today, Lea put together a five-game, six-day, 2,300-mile trip by train through the South because he needed money to finance the 1899 team, and barnstorming was the only way to get it.","While most college teams were playing four or five games a season, Sewanee played 12. Lea scheduled moneymaking games against the University of Texas and Texas A&M at the front end of the trip and games with Tulane, Louisiana State and the University of Mississippi on the back end.","“Luke Lea’s canniness and caginess is what made that program possible,” said Woody Register, a history professor at the University of the South who has researched the 1899 team. “It connects him to generations of program designers.”","Lea, who became a United States senator at age 32, is considered the first to come up with the idea of having trainers on road trips to take care of the players and massage their weary legs back into playing shape. He created a team that was a merciless bully: The Tigers were 12-0 and outscored opponents, 322-10. ","Sewanee could not pass the football, as per the rules of the day, and it would be no match for Alabama or Clemson. The team was also entirely white. The first African-American student to graduate from Sewanee, Nathaniel Owens, entered in 1966 and graduated in 1970. He was an outstanding football player. ","Nonetheless, Norman Jetmundsen Jr., a Birmingham lawyer who is putting together a documentary on the Sewanee team, is certain today’s elite teams would be impressed with the Tigers.","“They played 35 consecutive minutes a half on both sides of the ball with no substitution, and they played with serious injuries,” Jetmundsen said. “They played five games in six days on that train trip and won them all by shutout. Who wouldn’t be impressed by that?”","In a chapter of a book on the history of Sewanee, Register wrote that the 1899 team “formed part of the university’s heritage.” The professor said that Benjamin Lawton Wiggins, the university’s vice chancellor at the time, in particular, rallied students around the notion that football should be a part of the Southern male’s identity."," At the time, the South was desperate for cheer, and Sewanee’s success was seen as a response to the aristocratic Northerners of the day, who thought they owned the game. Football was something Southerners could excel at, especially in the aftermath of defeat in the Civil War and economic depression, said George Rable, an American historian.","“The 1890s were a rough time for the nation economically, but especially for the South,” Rable said. “Football provided some comfort and sense of achievement.” ",The Tigers lived by the notion that football players required a roughneck quality and a deep resolve. ,"Jetmundsen said halfback Henry Seibels, who was known as Diddy, suffered a gash on his head in the game with Texas, but continued playing when the wound was covered with quick-setting plaster. Lineman Wild Bill Claiborne played with an eye patch, ostensibly to protect an injury. He would look across at his opponent, gesture to the patch, and declare: “This is what happened in the last game. Let’s see what happens today.”",Fullback Ormond Simkins wore heavy knee braces as he battered into the line. His legs were eventually amputated below the knee because of football injuries.,"When the Southeastern Conference was created in 1932, Sewanee was a charter member, even though its days of being a powerhouse were long over. Inclusion was a tribute to the 1899 Tigers, a team for which Alabama’s Saban is a worthy descendant. ","Saban was the first coach in the SEC to consistently adopt a season-opening game in a neutral, big city for money and exposure when Alabama played Clemson in Atlanta in 2008. Now, marquee matchups at the start of the season are a regular occurrence across college football. Saban is also the primary fund-raiser for football facilities on campus, which are among the best nationally. He knows what Lea did — success requires money. ","“There is a connection between then and now because there is a significant money element at the center of the sport, and money is an unavoidable element of the game of college football,” Register said. “To have a mighty program, and be the champions of the South, which was their real aspiration, that required money.”","Saban has been a catalyst for football programs, Clemson among them, to add layers and layers of support staff, more than a century after Sewanee added trainers. And the Crimson Tide (13-0) are as merciless as they come. They outscored opponents by 33.1 points a game this season, the biggest margin in the country. Clemson was second at 30.6. ","Alabama and college football, in general, have become symbols of pride in the New South. As in 1899, Rable said, “there is still a sectional quality to the football” that has its roots in the sentiments created by the Civil War. If a team from the Southeastern Conference is throttling a team from another conference, he added, “you can hear chants of ‘SEC, SEC, SEC.’”","The ghosts of the Sewanee Tigers, nicknamed the Ironmen, would surely approve."
"Abnormal Levels of a Protein Linked to C.T.E. Found in N.F.L Players’ Brains, Study Shows - The New York Times","Experimental brain scans of more than two dozen former N.F.L. players found that the men had abnormal levels of the protein linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease associated with repeated hits to the head.","Using positron emission tomography, or PET, scans, the researchers found “elevated amounts of abnormal tau protein” in the parts of the brain associated with the disease, known as C.T.E., compared to men of similar age who had not played football.","The authors of the study and outside experts stressed that such tau imaging is far from a diagnostic test for C.T.E., which is likely years away and could include other markers, from blood and spinal fluid.","The results of the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, are considered preliminary, but constitute a first step toward developing a clinical test to determine the presence of C.T.E. in living players, as well as early signs and potential risk.","Thus far, pathologists have been able to confirm the diagnosis only posthumously, by identifying the tau signature in donated brains.","Previous studies had reported elevated levels of the tau signature in single cases. The new study is the first to compare the brains of a group of former players to a control group, using an imaging approach that specifically picks up tau and not other proteins in the brain.","“What makes this exciting is that it’s a great first step for imaging C.T.E. in the living, not just looking at single instances, but comparing averages and looking for patterns by comparing groups,” said Kevin Bieniek, director of the Biggs Institute Brain Bank Core at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.",Dr. Bieniek was not involved in the study.,"Over the past decade, the competition for research dollars to investigate C.T.E. has become fierce and political, with charges of exaggerated claims and interference by the N.F.L., which has produced scientific reports to rebut any link between the disease and repeated head trauma.","The group that develops the first useful clinical test stands to attract a surge of funding, not to mention potential commercial partnerships. At least one group, in California, has already formed a company to promote its own test.","The new study was led by Dr. Robert Stern of Boston University, which thus far has the largest collection of donated brains from former pro football players. He led a coalition of investigators at multiple centers who took brain images from 26 former pro players, aged 40 to 69, who had a variety of memory, mood and mental problems associated with C.T.E.","Those images showed marked elevation of tau proteins in the areas of the brain that display the tau signature when diagnosed post-mortem. The players’ tau signal in those areas was higher, on average, than the tau signal from a control group of men who had not played.","“We found, as well, that the amount of abnormal tau detected in these PET scans was associated with the number of years playing football,” Dr. Stern said.","His collaborators included brain scientists from the Mayo Clinic Arizona, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. Avid makes a molecule, called a ligand, that binds to proteins, in this case in the brain. Avid’s ligand is the most studied of the so-called tau detectors, and the company helped finance the study.","Experts said the findings were encouraging, because any reliable marker for abnormal tau accumulation would allow doctors not only to identify people with C.T.E., but also to monitor progress from potential drug treatments.","But, these experts said, much more work is required to develop a reliable test for a disorder that is still not well understood. As in tests for people suffering from Alzheimer’s and other diseases that affect the brain, researchers have spent years trying to precisely refine the ligands that are ingested by patients before they receive PET scans and other imaging tests.","There are also many open questions about the tau protein that is a signature of C.T.E. Researchers are trying to determine whether the protein, which occurs naturally in the brain, accumulates faster in people who have received repeated head trauma, and how those accumulating levels are related to behaviors associated with C.T.E., which include not only memory deficits but also impulse control issues and symptoms of depression.","The new study found no correlation between the strength of the abnormal tau signature and the severity of cognitive and mood problems in the former players, though the sample was small.",The search for a test for C.T.E. in living patients has received intense scrutiny since the disease was first discovered in deceased professional football players 15 years ago.,"The universe of professional players is relatively small — only about 2,000 active players and 20,000 retirees — and the Boston group’s work has been based on a sample of some of the worst cases. Many, perhaps most, pro football players do not develop disabling cognitive problems, and there are likely many other brain traumas that could potentially result in the C.T.E. tau signature.","Yet football is by far the country’s most popular sport, with more than a million high school students playing the tackle version of the game. The detection of C.T.E. in former pro players turned what was viewed as an occupational hazard into a public health debate. For years now, parents, coaches, school administrators, doctors and others have engaged in a dispute over whether children should be allowed to play collision sports.",Part of that dispute is trying to prove (or disprove) whether there is a direct link between exposure to repeated hits to the head absorbed in games like tackle football and the development of cognitive and neurological problems later in life.,"Here, the science is emerging. Studies by Dr. Stern and other researchers, including in the paper just released, suggest that there is a dose response — the more hits to the head, the more likely you are to develop problems later.",But researchers have questioned studies that have shown a high percentage of deceased former football players found with C.T.E. They claimed that the research subjects were self-selected because the families of players who suspected they had brain disease were more likely to donate their brains to science.,"Some researchers are looking at broader populations of people who have had traumatic brain injury, not just football players, to determine whether participation in collision sports, as opposed to genetics or other factors, is linked to the development of C.T.E.","“There’s a lot of lower-level head trauma out there that no one knows the consequence of,” said Dr. John Trojanowski, a research at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who plans to submit a research paper in the coming months on people who have suffered traumatic brain injury. “We are looking at people with traumatic brain injury, football players, rugby players, some people who fell off bikes.”","Even when tau is found in PET scans, many other questions remain.","“Identifying the tau is just a first step,” said Dr. Alexander Powers, associate professor of neurosurgery, pediatrics and orthopedics at Wake Forest School of Medicine. “Is tau increasing in the brain? And what is the rate? Does it steadily increase? Or rapidly, like cancer? And what are the factors that led to it?”"

And a couple of days later one actually appeared.,"The president talked about his fears about his son Barron playing tackle football. He sounded like any other concerned parent. No bluster, no posturing, just serious concern. To the extent that it matters, it was nice to see.",Robert RothNew York
Opinion | The Super Bowl That Trump’s America Deserves - The New York Times,"I’m not really sure why they’re bothering with a Super Bowl this year. Sure, a bunch of people will make a boatload of money, tens of millions of us will reflexively tune in and we’ll find rare common ground over how cheesy the halftime show is. But are we believers anymore? Will we really see the winner as the winner — or just as the charmed survivor of a grossly tarnished process? Be it the New England Patriots or the Los Angeles Rams, the team will have an asterisk after its name. And that asterisk is a big fat sign of the times. ","I’m referring, of course, to the miserable officiating that’s arguably the reason the Patriots beat the Kansas City Chiefs and the Rams beat the New Orleans Saints, leading to the matchup in this coming Sunday’s season-finale game. The Rams in particular were blessed by the referees, who failed to note and penalize a glaring case of pass interference in the climactic minutes. I needn’t describe what happened. Footage of it has been replayed as extensively and analyzed as exhaustively as the Zapruder film.","And it has prompted an intensity of protest, a magnitude of soul searching and a depth of cynicism that go well beyond the crime in question. That’s where the feelings about the Super Bowl and the mood of America converge.","[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] ","We’re still reeling from a presidential election that was colored if not corrupted by unfair advantages, undue meddling and disrespected rules, and here we have a Super Bowl that’s colored if not corrupted by unfair advantages, undue meddling and disrespected rules. Many fans are rejecting its legitimacy — sound familiar? There are conspiracy theories afoot.","Americans are so down on, and distrustful of, major institutions and authorities that we’re primed to declare their fraudulence, and the National Football League and the Super Bowl are on the receiving end of that. They’re not fresh targets, not by any stretch. But this time we've lost all sense of perspective. ","The missed pass-interference call in the clash between the Rams and Saints was certainly egregious, but every football game is a compendium of good and bad breaks; luck is always a factor and often the deciding one. The Saints had home-field advantage, and their fans created enough noise to addle and even paralyze the Rams on offense. The Saints also made errors galore, blowing the possibility of a lead too commanding to be erased by poor officiating. On a recent episode of his podcast, the sports commentator Bill Simmons methodically broke down the game en route to this conclusion: “I really thought the Rams were better.” He added that “if that’s a neutral field, I think the Rams win.”","That the Rams did win, with an assist from somnambulistic referees, has not gone over well in New Orleans. The Louisiana governor wrote a letter of condemnation to N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. The New Orleans City Council is considering a formal resolution declaring the outcome an “injustice” and demanding that the N.F.L. thoroughly review its rules. One of Louisiana’s senators has called for a congressional hearing on the matter.","Several Saints ticket holders have filed lawsuits against the N.F.L., variously claiming that they have endured mental anguish, lost the enjoyment of life and been defrauded by the league. A movement in New Orleans to boycott the Super Bowl involves the staging of competing events, vows by many bars not to show the game and pledges by many other bars to show, instead, the 2010 Super Bowl, in which the Saints beat the Indianapolis Colts. ","The team’s fans, in other words, can choose an alternative reality. Again, sound familiar?","Outside Louisiana, there have been murmurs about the fact that four referees in the Rams-Saints contest live in Southern California: Was a secret pro-Rams bias at work? There has also been angst about the speed of players now, the intricacies of the rule book, the ease of instant replay and what all of that portends. “What if this was the moment that blew all of our commonly held notions about officiating to pieces and made us really, truly question whether the game in its current state can really be adequately overseen by referees at all?” asked Conor Orr, epically, on Sports Illustrated’s website.","On Deadspin.com, Tom Ley went further, writing that football today “requires you to sit on your couch for three hours and spend the whole time questioning if what you saw is really what you saw.” The referees, the videotape and the fans have conflicting perceptions and wind up telling diverging stories — not just about the pass-interference bungle but about a roughing-the-passer penalty on a Chiefs player who, to my eyes, did nothing more than fail to blow Tom Brady an air kiss at the end of the play. That decision, too, was possibly game-changing, graduating Brady to a Super Bowl in which he may not belong.","Football has never been entirely fair, any more than life is. In the past, the Patriots were caught spying on other teams; the Saints were punished for deliberately trying to injure opposing teams’ players. Critics gasped and the band played on. Maybe the same will happen this time.",Or maybe the post-truth era has found its post-truth sport.
"Warren Wells, Star Receiver With a Derailed Career, Dies at 76 - The New York Times","Warren Wells, a former wide receiver who became one of the most feared deep threats of the vaunted Oakland Raiders of the late 1960s, but whose career ended after he served a season-long prison sentence, died on Thursday at a hospital in Beaumont, Tex. He was 76.","His death, after a heart attack, was confirmed by his son, Gary Stewart.","Wells joined the Raiders in 1967, during the waning years of the American Football League, when the team was a perennial playoff contender. Under Coach John Rauch and later John Madden, and with Daryle Lamonica and occasionally George Blanda at quarterback, the team was known for its long-bomb offense.","Wells, who stood 6 feet 1 inch and weighed a little under 200 pounds, was a cornerstone of that offense, with soft hands, slick moves and breakaway speed. His presence on the field also helped free up other talented receivers, like the Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff.","“It was fantastic to watch him play,” Biletnikoff was quoted as saying in a memorial to Wells on the Raiders’ website. “He has speed, he could run routes, he was so smooth, he could get on top of defensive backs so quick.”","Wells helped the Raiders reach three straight A.F.L. title games, from 1967 through 1969, and the first American Football Conference championship game after the A.F.L. merged with the National Football League in 1970.","During Wells’s four seasons with Oakland, he caught 156 passes for 3,634 yards and 42 touchdowns and was twice chosen for the Pro Bowl. His best season was 1969, when he led the A.F.L. in receiving yards (1,260), touchdowns (14) and yards per catch (an astonishing 26.8).","Wells had numerous highlight-reel plays. One came when the Raiders were down by 6 points with seconds left in a game against the Jets in December 1970. Lamonica threw 33 yards to Wells, who was surrounded by three Jets defenders in the end zone. One defender tipped the ball, and Wells snagged it for a touchdown. The Raiders won, 14-13, after Blanda kicked the extra point with one second on the clock.","But Wells’s success on the field became overshadowed by his problems off it. He was charged in a sexual assault case, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was placed on probation in 1969.","After the 1970 season, he got into a fracas at a bar in Beaumont that violated his probation. He missed the 1971 season while serving a prison term for the probation violation, and though he tried to return in 1972, he was no longer in playing shape.","“Warren just isn’t ready to play professional football at this time,” Madden, the Raiders’ coach, told reporters.","Over the next few years, Wells was charged with drunken driving and disturbing the peace. He never played another professional game.","Wells was born on Nov. 14, 1942, in Franklin, La., to Julia and Henry Wells and grew up in Beaumont. His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a mechanic. He went to Hebert High School in Beaumont and attended Texas Southern University before being picked by the Detroit Lions in the 12th round of the 1964 N.F.L. draft.","Wells played in nine games for the Lions in 1964 and, after the season ended, was drafted into the Army. He spent two years serving in Alaska and joined the Raiders after his tour.","In addition to his son, Gary, he is survived by a sister, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.","Wells dealt with dementia and alcoholism for years after his professional career and was cared for by his son and other family members, including Wells’s sister-in-law, Consetta Wells; a nephew, Wyron Wells; and a niece, Raquel Wells-Joseph.","Gary Wells said that his father finally gave up alcohol for good years ago. Wyron Wells said that Wells’s brain was being checked for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found in a number of former football players.",In 1999 Wells told The Associated Press that he had to “look toward the future and quit looking back” in order to reclaim his life.,"“I need to forget about that period, what happened in Oakland, and get my life straight,” he said."
"In the Case of Kyler Murray, the A’s Bet Big and Lost - The New York Times",The Oakland Athletics were overjoyed to choose Kyler Murray with the ninth pick in the baseball draft last June.,"“We just don’t see athletes like this on the baseball field very often,” their scouting director, Eric Kubota, said then, praising Murray’s instincts despite his relative lack of baseball experience. “He’s just a tremendous athlete, which can translate to the baseball field in a lot of ways. He has a chance to really be dominant on both the offensive end and from a defensive standpoint.”",Kubota said the risk of Murray’s playing quarterback at the University of Oklahoma was worth taking.,"“Frankly, we’re kind of excited to be an Oklahoma fan for 12 games,” he said.","Everybody knows what happened next. Those 12 regular-season games led to the conference title game and the Orange Bowl, and by the end, Murray had more than 5,000 all-purpose yards, 54 overall touchdowns, a Heisman Trophy — and a new career path.","Murray announced via Twitter on Monday that he was “firmly and fully committing my life and time to becoming an N.F.L. quarterback.” His statement made no mention of baseball, the A’s, or the $4.6 million deal he reached with them last June, with the promise to play only baseball after the 2018 college football season.","The A’s were the first team to hold formal workouts for pitchers and catchers on Monday — they started earlier than other teams, to prepare for a season-opening series in Japan with the Seattle Mariners on March 20 and 21 — and Murray will not be joining them. He will return $1.29 million of his $1.5 million signing bonus, according to ESPN, and will not collect the remaining $3.16 million that he was due to be paid next month.","He had been assigned a locker in the clubhouse, and on Monday morning, Oakland officials had expressed hope that Murray would soon slip into his No. 73 jersey.","Bob Melvin, the A’s manager, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Murray would choose baseball, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Yet, realistically, those hopes had been dimming since Murray declared for the N.F.L. draft on Jan. 14. The A’s retain his rights should Murray ever reconsider, but they will get no compensation pick for his defection. They gambled and lost — but baseball lost even bigger.","Murray teased the possibility of playing both sports in a photo he posted to Twitter in November, re-enacting a ubiquitous Bo Jackson photo from the 1980s by posing shirtless with football pads on his shoulders and a baseball bat behind his back.","But Jackson, of course, did not play quarterback, an all-consuming position that leaves no room for distraction. To maximize his appeal to teams — and his potential for success — Murray chose football exclusively, which most likely will bring him more money, at least at first, and definitely offers a quicker path to glory.","The sports are fundamentally different in their development processes, of course. Almost every baseball player logs years in the minors, riding buses to remote outposts for a punishing daily test that is at least as much mental as physical. A first-round N.F.L. quarterback is typically hailed as the instant savior of his franchise.","Murray’s predecessor as Heisman Trophy winner and Oklahoma quarterback, Baker Mayfield, needed one month to establish himself as the starter for the Cleveland Browns. He sat the first two weeks, came off the bench in Week 3 and was starting for good by Sept. 30. What’s more appealing to a 21-year-old athlete: the Mayfield plan, or a summer trying to hit sliders for an A’s affiliate in Beloit, Wis., or Stockton, Calif.?","Murray’s uncle, Calvin Murray, offers an example of the uncertainties of life as a baseball prospect. The San Francisco Giants chose Calvin Murray with the seventh overall pick in the 1992 draft. He played more than 1,600 professional games, but fewer than 300 in the majors. The player taken one pick before Murray did just a bit better. His name was Derek Jeter.","We’ll probably never know what Kyler Murray could have been as a baseball player. He could always try the sport again if football fizzles, as Tim Tebow is doing with the Mets. But baseball, as an institution, does not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like Murray, whose bonus potential was limited by the strict draft-slotting system instituted in 2012.","The draft system has always incentivized losing, to some extent — in 2009 and 2010, the Washington Nationals plotted a new course by taking Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper first over all in consecutive drafts. But by awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to teams — with the worst team getting by far the largest allowance — the new rules have greatly encouraged protracted rebuilding.","The Houston Astros understood this better than most, and became a perennial power by using the system to their advantage. They have spawned so many imitators that a record eight teams tallied 95 losses last season.","The players’ union has been dismayed by this trend, which has lessened demand — and therefore salaries — for veteran free agents. Murray’s case shows another regrettable consequence. Perhaps if the A’s had been able to offer more money to Murray last June, they could have kept him off the football field entirely.","Instead, their $4.6 million bought only a half-measure, allowing Murray one final fling with an old flame. As it turns out, he fell truly, madly, deeply back in love. The A’s get their ring back, but baseball is left at the altar."
How Boring Was the Super Bowl? The Punts Got Exciting - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — “It’s getting exciting now,” Jim Nantz of CBS said in mock excitement in the second half of the Super Bowl on Sunday night.",He was talking about a punt.,"Los Angeles Rams punter Johnny Hekker’s 65-yard roller set the record for longest Super Bowl punt, and through three quarters, with a score of a 3-3, it truly was the most exciting play.","Nantz’s CBS broadcast partner, Tony Romo, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, had been the subject of much news coverage leading up to Sunday, mostly for his ability to predict plays and for the infectious enthusiasm he brings to his work.","But by the time of Hekker’s punt almost halfway through the third quarter, the game’s dullness seemed to have broken even him.","“This is hard to watch,” Romo said. “I mean, this is how many punts in a row?”","For the Rams, it was the eighth consecutive possession ending in a punt. As Hekker’s kick from the end zone tumbled to the Patriots’ 29-yard line, Nantz mused that it could set the record.","“Oh, you’ve been waiting for a stat like that,” Romo teased him.",“That’s it!” Nantz yelled. “That’s the highlight of the game.”,"Hekker turned out to be the closest thing to a star the Rams could muster. A squad that finished the regular season as the second-highest-scoring team in football finished the Super Bowl without a touchdown, in a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots.",The collapse of the offense was not missed by the players who participated in the losing effort.,"“Last time I checked, defense wins championships,” C. J. Anderson, the Rams’ backup running back, said after a game in which his team managed just 57 total yards in the first half. “That saying has been in football for a long time.”","The game, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in N.F.L. history, was hardly one to remember for the Patriots offense, which plodded along to 407 yards and just one touchdown, but it offered no shortage of ways to sum up the Rams’ offensive ineptitude.","■ The Rams ended all of their drives with punts until Greg Zuerlein kicked a field goal with 2 minutes 11 seconds left in the third quarter. Even that one could hardly be described as an offensive triumph, as Zuerlein, nursing a heel injury, had to connect from 53 yards out. In all, the Rams’ drive chart looked brutal: punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, field goal, punt, interception, missed field goal.","■ Todd Gurley, who led the N.F.L. with 21 total touchdowns this season, ran for just 35 yards on 10 carries and caught one pass for minus-1 yard. His plus-size backup, Anderson, ran for 22 yards on seven carries. Anderson credited the Patriots’ gap control with stopping both him and Gurley. “Obviously neither of us got going,” Anderson said, “so you’ve got to give it to New England on that.”","■ Partly as a result of that stymied running game, Jared Goff, the team’s superstar third-year quarterback, spent the entire game running for his life. He may have been sacked just four times, but he was hit by a Patriots defender on 12 other plays. The constant pressure resulted in nearly all of his throws being rushed.","■ It was the first time since Coach Sean McVay took over the team that the Rams were shut out in a first half, and it was just the second time in 36 games (including the playoffs) that they were held without a touchdown.",■ Los Angeles never ran a play in the red zone. The team’s best effort got it to New England’s 27-yard line before Goff threw an interception that essentially handed the win to the Patriots.,■ The Rams converted just 3 of 13 third-down plays.,■ They were held below 300 total yards for just the second time this season.,■ They were penalized for 65 yards and rushed for just 62.,"In all, that collection of offensive atrocities led to Hekker’s punting the ball nine times for 417 yards, only the third most in Super Bowl history, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. Baltimore’s Kyle Richardson set the record with 430 in the Baltimore Ravens’ win over the Giants in Super Bowl XXXV. That game resulted in a whopping 852 combined punting yards, making this game’s 632 combined yards seem pedestrian.","Hekker’s effort gave Nantz a record to tout, and it gave the punter’s family something to watch. But for the Rams, who came into the week as the leaders of the N.F.L.’s offensive revolution, the game offered little beyond disappointment."
Robert Kraft Pleads Not Guilty to Prostitution Charges - The New York Times,"Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the N.F.L.’s New England Patriots, has pleaded not guilty in Florida to charges of soliciting prostitution.","The plea, on two first-degree misdemeanor charges, were submitted in writing to the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach County, not in person. Mr. Kraft requested a nonjury trial. The plea was filed Monday and made public on Thursday.","Mr. Kraft was charged with two first-degree misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution. He was one of 25 people charged by the state attorney. If convicted, Mr. Kraft would face up to one year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service. However, at a news conference on Monday, the state attorney, Dave Aronberg, said that first-time offenders rarely spent time in jail.","Mr. Kraft has a scheduled court date of March 27 in Florida. He is not required to be present and most likely will be represented by his lawyer, Jack Goldberger.","The plea was not a surprise. When news of the charges against Mr. Kraft broke last week, a Patriots spokesman said, “We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.”","Mr. Kraft could also face discipline from N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell has broad powers to penalize not only players but also league executives and team owners. Mr. Kraft can be fined up to $500,000 and suspended for several games, which would mean he would have to stay away from the team’s practice site and stadium. If Mr. Goodell seeks a harsher penalty, he would need the approval of the other owners.","A few owners have been penalized in prior years, but those punishments were for felony convictions. While Mr. Kraft’s legal case is less severe, and the charges could be reduced or dropped, the league could still punish him for “conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football.”","The league has tried to address criticism that it has been too lenient with players accused of domestic abuse. Teams, too, have been criticized for mistreating their cheerleaders. The N.F.L. has also supported efforts by law enforcement agencies to combat human sex trafficking.","Mr. Kraft has also donated heavily to My Life, My Choice, a nonprofit organization in Boston that supports girls who were exploited by the commercial sex industry.","The police said they had captured Mr. Kraft on video during two visits to a storefront massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla., a 30-minute drive from Palm Beach, where Mr. Kraft stays when he is in Florida.","According to the affidavit, he visited the parlor on Jan. 19, arriving in a Bentley driven by a chauffeur. Hidden-camera recordings showed Mr. Kraft entering the massage parlor, and a woman massaging his genitals.","The next day, Mr. Kraft returned in a different chauffeur-driven Bentley for a 14-minute visit that included another sex act, according to the affidavit. Later that day, he flew to Kansas City, Mo., where the Patriots beat the Chiefs in the A.F.C. championship game to earn a berth in the Super Bowl.","Two weeks later, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, to win their sixth Super Bowl title under Mr. Kraft’s ownership, which began in 1994."
Patriots Owner Robert Kraft Faces Biggest Test of His Power - The New York Times,"Two Fridays ago, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, was in Los Angeles, one of his homes away from home.","He started the day at Nate and Al’s, the Beverly Hills delicatessen where he occasionally dines with friends, including Larry King and Steve Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants. Later that day, he was supposed to play golf with Al Michaels, the longtime host of “Sunday Night Football.”","Kraft never made it to the first tee at the Bel-Air Country Club. During the morning he received word that the police 2,600 miles away in Florida were charging him with two counts of soliciting a prostitute at a massage parlor in Jupiter. Since then, authorities have revealed that Kraft is one of hundreds of men facing solicitation charges as part of a case that also encompasses suspected human trafficking in South Florida.",[Read more: Behind Illicit Massage Parlors Lie a Vast Crime Network and Modern Indentured Servitude],"Suddenly, Kraft’s off-season, and perhaps his status as one of the most influential N.F.L. owners, had been turned upside down.","It is telling that he received the news while in Los Angeles, the capital of the entertainment industry. In the quarter-century since he bought the Patriots, Kraft has been at the center of countless business decisions affecting the league, from labor agreements to franchise sales to the commissioner’s compensation. But Kraft has also left his mark by forming friendships with the leaders of the media companies that pay billions of dollars to televise N.F.L. games.","Those contracts account for about half of the N.F.L.’s estimated $14 billion annual revenue. As the chairman of the league’s media committee, Kraft has become the N.F.L.’s seemingly indispensable owner, as anyone who holds that position usually is, and he has been expert at getting networks like CBS and Fox to pay previously unimaginable rights fees, and making them feel as if they were lucky to do so.","“He is a clever negotiator,” said David Hill, the former chairman of Fox Sports. “He could look at what the broadcaster needed and gauge what they felt they could pay but still leave something on the table so you don’t feel like you were gouged.”","Now Kraft may have compromised his stature within that most exclusive of American business clubs. In addition to any league punishment, he faces up to one year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service — though since this would be a first-time offense, prosecutors said, he is unlikely to spend any time behind bars if convicted.","On Feb. 25, Kraft pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges. A date in court, where he is likely to be represented by his lawyer, is scheduled for March 27.","Kraft’s behavior has come under scrutiny before. He has admitted to meddling in football decisions and alienating his coaches in his early years of owning the Patriots. In 2008, he apologized after his team was fined $250,000 and lost a first-round draft pick because of allegations in 2007 that the Patriots videotaped their opponent’s offensive or defensive signals. Coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000. In 2013, Kraft claimed he was “duped” by Aaron Hernandez, the Patriots tight end who was convicted of murder and later killed himself in prison.","In ownership circles, Kraft is known to act as a kind of shadow commissioner, forming close relationships with sponsors, vendors, media companies and even the N.F.L. Players Association, and pursuing back-channel communications that can sometimes circumvent his fellow owners and league officials.","His influence, though, has limits. Many owners tolerate Kraft’s freelancing because he gets results and tries to keep other owners in the loop. But their tolerance runs thin when his team is accused of wrongdoing, as happened in the Spygate scandal and in 2015, when the Patriots were accused of deflating footballs before the A.F.C. championship game. In those cases, owners were not unhappy when the commissioner penalized the team.","Numerous former and current league executives and Kraft’s ownership brethren declined to comment on the record for this article, as did Kraft. Even privately, many of them were reluctant to criticize him for the solicitation charges, which they consider a personal matter.","It is possible, though, that the arrest could diminish Kraft’s standing among the owners just as his skill sets and relationships are needed.","The league’s television contracts are up for renewal in two years, and the N.F.L. would like new players like Amazon to jump into the fray. Negotiations are likely to be complicated as the league and networks figure out how to value rights for streaming and other new technology. Kraft lost a major ally in Leslie Moonves, his longtime friend, who was forced to step down as chief executive of CBS in September after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct.","If Kraft is concerned about his own allegations, he is not showing it. While he has not spoken publicly about the charges, which the police said stem from video recordings of him, Kraft has been seen in public, including at a pre-Oscars brunch on Feb. 23 where he was photographed with Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive.","When Kraft returned to Boston the next day, he was spotted hugging Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after they got off a private jet.","Amid the solicitation case in Florida, it is unclear how involved Kraft will be in league business in the coming months. The N.F.L. is preparing not only for talks with television networks but also for negotiations with the players’ union, whose contract expires at the end of next season. Kraft also sits on the finance and compensation committees, and the management council, which represents the league in labor talks.","Kraft can be an affable but cunning negotiator, and both his business and people skills were hard to miss in 2011 during negotiations over the collective bargaining agreement. Several owners pushed the league to take a hard line and exploit their leverage over the players’ union after a court ruling in their favor, but Kraft was among a contingent of owners leading negotiations in Washington who saw an opening to push the talks across the finish line. While Kraft shuttled back and forth to Boston, where his wife, Myra, was dying of ovarian cancer, he maintained a direct line of communication with leaders of the players’ union.","After the two sides reached a deal, Jeff Saturday, a member of the union’s executive committee, thanked Kraft. “Without him, this deal does not get done,” he said at the time.","ESPN, where Saturday works, said he was not available for an interview. But nearly all of Kraft’s associates contacted for this article said Kraft was a careful listener who asked questions and had a knack for proposing solutions. While he does have a temper, they said, he rarely loses it.","Kraft has spoken often about the need to put league matters over personal ones. In November 2017, he was interviewed with his oldest son, Jonathan, onstage at a sports industry conference in New York. In a thinly veiled criticism of Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ owner, Kraft urged owners to act as partners and not perceive themselves as “bigger than the league itself.” Jones had threatened to sue Kraft and other owners who wanted to extend Commissioner Roger Goodell’s contract.","“It’s more important,” Kraft said, “that the people running the league do the right thing for the league than for any one franchise.”"
This Super Bowl Is Not Everyone’s Bowl of Chips - The New York Times,Some cities are not all in on the Super Bowl this year. And those places include the city where the game is being held and the city that one of the two teams calls home.,But which city is offering up the most indifference to Sunday’s matchup between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams? There are four chief candidates.,"St. Louis was the home of the Rams for 21 years, but more recently not the home of the Rams for the past three years. Fans there are still angry their team left after the 2015 season. Few are excited about the Super Bowl, and fewer still expect to root for the Rams.","“Since the Rams left, I’ve watched little to no football. If it’s on a television, I look elsewhere,” the former Rams fan Dan Buffa wrote in an essay on KSDK titled, “Why I Won’t Be Watching the Super Bowl.”","Fans are especially bitter about the way the Rams’ owner, Stan Kroenke, a Missouri native, left town with the team: with a flurry of dismissive comments about the city’s economic prospects. In an objection to a plan to finance a new stadium in St. Louis, he wrote: “Any N.F.L. club that signs on to this proposal in St. Louis will be well on the road to financial ruin, and the league will be harmed.”","And to many onetime Rams fans, it seemed as if the team didn’t turn on the real effort to win until the move. Sure, the St. Louis Rams went to two Super Bowls, winning in the 1999 season. But after 12 straight seasons at .500 and below in St. Louis, the team waited till it got to Los Angeles to fire Coach Jeff Fisher and bring in the young genius Sean McVay, who brought immediate success.","St. Louis fans don’t feel much good will toward the Patriots, either, since that was the team that beat St. Louis in its last trip to the Super Bowl, in 2002. That Rams team, known as the Greatest Show on Turf, was a 14-point favorite. And many former Rams players, including Marshall Faulk, have contended that New England cheated by filming the Rams’ walk-through the day before the game.",“Is there anywhere in the rule book that both teams can lose?” a fan named James Heredia asked CBS.,"Falling a game short of the Super Bowl is painful. When a major reason is a blown call, it stings even more. The agony of losing the N.F.C. conference championship game to the Rams has led many Saints fans to turn their back on the big game.",Don’t believe us. Believe the governor.,"“I’ll be honest — I don’t know anyone who has interest in watching the game in our entire state,” Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana told USA Today. He added the opinion that “it was the worst call in the history of the N.F.L.”","It was only two weeks ago, but to refresh your memory: Late in a tied game, with the Saints driving, Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman slammed into New Orleans receiver Tommylee Lewis. It looked like pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet hit, or both. But there was no call, the pass was ruled incomplete, and the Saints had to settle for a field goal. The Rams had time to match that field goal, then won in overtime.","On Wednesday, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., acknowledged the officiating crew messed up on the play.","The loss, combined with the recent trade request of the Pelicans star Anthony Davis, led Jeff Duncan of The Times-Picayune to write: “With the notable exception of the fall of 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, I can’t think of a worse period in our city’s sports history.”","Eater New Orleans offered a list of “12 Places to Avoid Super Bowl LIII,” bars and restaurants that promise not to show the game on any of their televisions. In some cases, they will instead show a replay of the Saints’ championship from nine years ago.","Nola.com has 25 reasons not to watch the Super Bowl, but “could come up with 325.”","There’s enough disdain in New Orleans that fans are using words like “boycott” and saying they hope they can help hold the Super Bowl ratings down to a record low. But even mass participation is unlikely to make a decisive impact: The New Orleans area has a population of a little over a million, and the Super Bowl regularly draws more than 50 million.","O.K., it’s overstating it a little to say Los Angeles isn’t excited about going to the Super Bowl. After all, thousands of fans waited in long lines this week for a pregame rally.","But while other cities virtually stop when their team makes the big game, Los Angeles has reacted with a comparative shrug.","After only three seasons back in town, the Rams haven’t sunk into the city’s bones the way, say, the Packers and the Steelers have in their football-mad hometowns.","And, hey, LeBron James just came back to the Lakers after missing five weeks with an injury.","The Los Angeles area, home to roughly 13 million people, has 11 major professional sports teams and prominent college programs. Many residents came from somewhere else, and brought their allegiances, perhaps even to the Patriots, with them.","Some fans chose other teams during the two decades the N.F.L. was absent from Los Angeles. As Philip Nowlen told The New York Times’s California Today newsletter, “The years without a team led me to fan commitments to the 49ers and the Pats. Maybe after time passes … maybe.”","While the Rams drew a robust 72,000 fans a game this season, playing in the cavernous Coliseum meant they were  at 77 percent of capacity, 31st of the 32 teams in the N.F.L.",Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald got some attention this week by proclaiming that L.A. is “a football town now.” But his avowal is less interesting than the fact that he was asked about it at all. No one asked Tom Brady if Boston planned to follow this year’s Super Bowl.,It hasn’t even been two years since the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead over the Patriots and transformed a third-quarter Super Bowl score into a lasting slur.,So perhaps Atlanta can be forgiven if it is greeting anything about any Super Bowl — especially a Patriots-involved Super Bowl — with only so much good cheer.,"Yes, downtown and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are glimmering under a global spotlight, and the city, rightly proud of its hospitality tradition, is eager to show it can be the flawless host of a Super Bowl it worked so hard to earn. Mercedes-Benz Stadium, just two seasons old and already a crown jewel of Southern sports, will be on display for all to see.","“Everything I’ve been getting so far is superpositive,” said Jessie Tuggle, the beloved linebacker who played his entire professional career for the Falcons and retired after the 2000 season. “I think people like being around people, and there are so many people around. They just love the N.F.L. experience.”","And yet. Cue a new round of gripes over traffic. Trigger even more critiques of the Falcons’ middling performances of late, and wonder how so many Super Bowl events seem so out of reach for so many football fans. Stir the complaints over the halftime show, and how and why Maroon 5 landed the biggest gig in a city with one of the country’s richest music scenes.","It is even a moment when Atlanta’s prized export, Coca-Cola, is a target for trolling by Pepsi, a major N.F.L. sponsor that has made no secret of its pleasure over a big week in one particular city. (“Look who’s in town for Super Bowl LIII,” read one Pepsi advertisement outside a Coke-sponsored shrine to Coke.)","But even with all of that — the Pepsi flowing, the traffic slowing, the Falcons sputtering, Maroon 5 just being Maroon 5 — hey, at least the Saints aren’t playing. Alan Blinder"
"For Odell Beckham Jr., a Departure as Stunning as His Catches - The New York Times","On Nov. 23, 2014, in a nationally televised Sunday night game against the Dallas Cowboys, Odell Beckham Jr., then a Giants rookie, leapt high in the end zone, twisted as he arched backward, fought off a defender and made a fingertip, one-handed touchdown grab that seemed unfathomable even in slow motion replay.","The next day, Beckham’s acrobatics had physicists, mechanical engineers and sports scientists scratching their heads.","“It was a bit like Spider-Man,” said Jim Gates, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland. “A near superhuman activity.”",In that moment — in just the seventh game of a nascent pro career — Beckham’s place in N.F.L. lore was cemented.,"Within months, he had won the league’s Offensive Rookie of the Year award, played in the Pro Bowl and became the youngest player ever to grace the cover of the omnipresent Madden N.F.L. video game. Beckham’s No. 13 jersey quickly became the hottest-selling football apparel nationwide. He was the new face of the storied Giants franchise.","It is hard to believe that a little more than four years later, Beckham has been brusquely jettisoned from the team. On Tuesday, the popular, if sometimes mercurial, Beckham was traded to the Cleveland Browns for Jabrill Peppers, a safety with a modest record of N.F.L. achievement, and two draft picks (the 17th and 95th of next month’s draft) that, while valuable, are not likely to yield a star of Beckham’s magnitude.","Beckham’s mystifying departure may be a window into a new N.F.L., in which players and teams can transition from seemingly amicable partners — Beckham signed a five-year, $90 million  contract extension with the Giants about six months ago — to rivals on opposing sidelines faster than ever before.","Star players were once bound to teams for many years because restrictive guidelines made unfettered free agency hard to achieve. There is more movement in the modern N.F.L., and even Beckham’s contract, which at the time made him the highest-paid wide receiver in football, did not mean that the Giants wanted him around for long. Still, Beckham’s trade did not happen in a vacuum. In the last week, Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell, whose offensive production in Pittsburgh made them prospective Hall of Fame players, moved on from the Steelers.","Beckham, 26, surely played a role in his exit. He embarrassed himself and the team with his mano-a-mano slugfest with Josh Norman, which contributed to a 2015 Giants loss. His end zone celebrations could be profane, and his antics on the sideline self-aggrandizing. As the leader of an ill-advised, overnight Florida boating trip when the team was preparing for a rare playoff game — followed by an inferior performance in a loss at Green Bay — he continued to demonstrate a level of immaturity.","A television interview last fall in which Beckham did not show support for quarterback Eli Manning and seemed to question his teammates’ effort produced more hand-wringing in the Giants offices at the highest levels, including ownership. A portion of the Giants fandom also began to sour on Beckham because of his volatility.","In today’s N.F.L., some teams choose to abandon their hefty investments in players who are distractions rather than wait for those players to become such problems that they must be moved. Or team executives ditch the player before he tries to force a trade, as Brown did, and in that way maintain their trading leverage.","The real surprise in the Beckham case is that it was the staid Giants who chose to push their most talented and popular player out the door — and to do it in his prime. The Giants are historically much more conscious and concerned about fan reaction to their transactions. But not in this situation. Beckham was dispensable, even if it meant that the tens of thousands of Giants fans with one of Beckham’s replica jerseys hanging in a closet — many of them prized fans under the age of 35 — were thunderstruck by Tuesday’s deal.","The Giants fan base is already reeling, and not just because its team has had one winning season since 2012. Beckham’s trade is just one of several recent purges of the team’s roster that have left many fans confounded and angry. There are, for example, only three players remaining from the team’s Week 1 starting lineup in 2016.","Moreover, if there is a clear path that the Giants are following, indeed if there is a plan at all, it’s not easily deciphered.","Yes, the Giants are in a rebuilding mode. But they will have to rebuild with financial constraints. About $16 million of Beckham’s salary will count against the Giants’ 2019 cap, and more startling, that’s less than half of the $32.5 million on this year’s salary cap ledger for players who are not here anymore: The Giants also recently traded or cut players like cornerback Eli Apple, defensive end Olivier Vernon, defensive tackle Damon Harrison and offensive lineman Patrick Omameh.","And Manning is due about $23 million next season. That total could be reduced if Manning is cut in a few days, before his bonus is due. If that happens, it may provide some clarity on the front office’s apparent overall strategy of tearing down everything to start over. But losing Manning on top of Beckham may leave some Giants loyalists apoplectic. If not catatonic.","In the end, Beckham’s exit underscores another relevant pattern: Every Giants first-round draft choice from 2013 to 2016 has either been traded or released by the team. Of the 70 players the Giants selected from 2008 to 2017, only six remain.","More than any other factor, that is why the Giants have lost 24 of their last 32 games and have not won a playoff game in seven years. With his magical pass-catching skills, Beckham was once seen as a Giants savior. The team and its fans now have to find a new one."
N.F.L. Players Union Says Retiree Benefits Are a Priority - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — The executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association, DeMaurice Smith, said Thursday that the union would push for more generous benefits for all retired players in the coming negotiations over the collective bargaining agreement, which expires after the 2020 season.","The union has been criticized for not doing enough to improve the pensions and health insurance for older retired players. Eric Dickerson and a group of other former stars sent a letter to Smith, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, and David Baker, the president of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, saying they would not attend the annual induction ceremony until all members of the Hall of Fame receive health insurance and a salary.","In September, another group of prominent former players formed a nonprofit group called Fairness for Athletes in Retirement, or FAIR, that has a single goal: to gain pensions equivalent to those of players who retired after 1993. Before 1993, pension contributions were far less than for players who retired after that year.","Smith said that helping retired players had always been a priority, noting that in 2011, the league and the union established the Legacy Fund, which provided $620 million to improve the pensions of players who retired before 1993.","“We have always reached back and improved pensions,” he said. “I think it’s smart that former players understand that we can accomplish more in improving benefits. This is a union that is never going to select a certain group of players over another group of players.”","Dewey McClain, a former player and an executive committee member at the Players Association, added, “There are roughly 25,000 former players, and we need to take care of all of them.”","Improving retiree benefits will be one of many issues facing the union as it braces for negotiations to renew its labor deal. During the last negotiation, in 2011, the owners locked out the players, and the work stoppage lasted about four months.","The union has been diverting royalties from its deal with Electronic Arts, the maker of the “Madden NFL” series of video games, into a fund to be used in case of another lockout. Smith declined to say whether the union would sue the league if it diverted money from its media contracts into its own fund, a step the union took in 2011. But he did say negotiations were not a pretty process.","“It is one of the messiest, nastiest things you could ever do,” he said.","The union wants to increase the share of players contracts that are guaranteed, but Smith said that was not necessarily something that could be achieved through the coming negotiations. Rather, it could be gained more quickly by players demanding it in contract negotiations.","The union’s executive members were encouraged that Kirk Cousins, a quarterback on the Minnesota Vikings, was able to sign a fully guaranteed, three-year $84 million contract last off-season.","“Would we love guaranteed contracts? Yes,” said Mark Herzlich, a member of the executive committee. “Is it something we will ask for? Yes. Is it the sole thing we will ask for? No.”"
Chargers’ Defense Stifles Ravens in Wild-Card Playoff Win - The New York Times,"BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Ravens’ startling charge into the playoffs was spurred by something perhaps even more surprising: a radical, run-first style of offense led by the rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson.","Baltimore’s unconventional style of attack in the midst of a pass-happy N.F.L. era rescued the Ravens, who won six of their final seven regular-season games. And the most impressive victory in that stretch was a 12-point romp over the Chargers in Los Angeles in Week 16.","In the end, however, the defeat of the Chargers was the Ravens’ undoing in their rematch here Sunday in an A.F.C. wild-card playoff game.","In the week leading up to Sunday’s contest, the Chargers dissected the videotape of the Ravens’ Dec. 22 triumph in Los Angeles until every play and, more important, the alignments before every play were committed to memory. The Chargers’ defensive coaches schooled the players on every Ravens tendency and tried a daring lineup that included seven defensive backs instead of the usual four or five.","The study and the strategy worked. Until a late rally in the final minutes, Baltimore’s new-look offense had just 3 points and three first downs. Jackson was challenged and confounded into a dreadful performance as Los Angeles built a commanding lead and held on to upset the Ravens, 23-17.","“We had better reads on their formations, and we saw things coming,” Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa said in the winning locker room. “It really was kind of a blessing to have played them and seen them just a few weeks ago.”",The Chargers’ defensive approach forced Jackson into three fumbles — one of which he lost — and an interception. He was sacked seven times.,"“You could see we were frustrating them,” Los Angeles cornerback Casey Hayward Jr. said. “They were confused. What had been working for them was not working.”","Or, as Chargers Coach Anthony Lynn said when asked if the Ravens had appeared flustered: “If you’re used to running the ball for 300 yards and you get only 80, yeah, you get flustered.”","Los Angeles, which has won its last seven road games, will travel to New England to face the Patriots in a divisional-round game Sunday at 1 p.m.","For the Chargers, the rare alignment of seven defensive backs, which replaced bulky linebackers with smaller, fleet defenders, was a risk. But it was intended to thwart Jackson’s advanced rushing skills.","“Lamar is so fast, we wanted our fastest guys defending him, even if it meant smaller guys,” Lynn said. “We didn’t know if it would work, but we wanted to take a look at it.",“We were definitely ready to move onto a different defensive grouping if it didn’t work. But it did.”,"Indeed, it was effective immediately and set the tone for the game. On the first play from scrimmage, Jackson kept the football and tried to dash around right end. He was tackled for a 1-yard loss by safety Derwin James.","Recalling the play, Lynn smiled broadly.","“The first time we played them, we played their game,” he said. “Today, we played our game.”","For the Ravens, the loss brought a sudden end to a season marked by drastic change. The longtime Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was overtaken by Jackson, who remains the franchise’s top quarterback moving forward. John Harbaugh, whose job as Baltimore’s head coach had seemed in jeopardy until the late surge by the Ravens, still may not remain.","Flacco did not comment on his future Sunday, although he insisted that he did not think he should have replaced Jackson as the Ravens fell behind Los Angeles by 17 points. Harbaugh also declined to discuss his own future in detail.","“No one can say what tomorrow is going to bring,” Harbaugh said. “We’ll see. I have every expectation to be here as long as they want me here.”","The victory was also a subtle but authoritative accomplishment by the veteran Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, who was appearing in his 10th postseason game. Rivers, who completed 22 of 32 passes, coolly and carefully led the Los Angeles offense on six scoring drives against the N.F.L.’s top-ranked defense.","Rivers did not throw an interception and was sacked just once. And while the Chargers lost one fumble, they were otherwise judicious with the football and exhibited the kind of ball-control offense that had been Baltimore’s bread and butter in its charge to the playoffs.","Advancing cautiously for most of the game, Los Angeles kicked four field goals to take a 12-0 halftime lead. In the third quarter, a Chargers turnover and a blocked punt by the Ravens gave Baltimore a brief surge of momentum. But the Ravens could turn the miscues into only 3 points when a fumble recovery by C. J. Mosley led to a 33-yard Justin Tucker field goal. After the Ravens’ Buck Allen partially blocked a punt and gave Baltimore good field position, the possession led only to a 50-yard field-goal attempt that Tucker missed.","On the ensuing Chargers possession, a 28-yard pass from Rivers to Mike Williams, followed by a 14-yard run by Melvin Gordon, set up a third down from the Ravens’ 1-yard line. Gordon was tripped and fell just before the goal line; the play was ruled a touchdown until it was overturned by video replay.","On the subsequent fourth-down play, Gordon bulled into the end zone. The Chargers completed a 2-point conversion to extend their lead to 20-3.","At this point, fans at M&T Bank Stadium began chanting Flacco’s name. Jackson remained in the game, but his presence elicited a chorus of boos from the crowd. That displeasure intensified when Jackson was twice sacked on a three-and-out series.","But on the next series, Jackson awakened and tossed a 31-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree with 6 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. On the Ravens’ next possession, Jackson connected with Crabtree again, throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass that cut the Chargers’ lead to 23-17 with 1:59 left.","The Ravens did get the football for a final series, but their comeback ended when Jackson was stripped of the football as he was preparing to pass. The fumble was recovered by the Chargers’ Melvin Ingram, who dominated the Ravens’ offensive line throughout Sunday’s game. Ingram had seven tackles and two sacks.","“This was and was not a typical game for us,” Rivers said afterward. “Because we’ve had all kinds of victories — ugly ones, pretty ones, good games offensively and good games defensively. That’s just us. But mostly, I think we’re a pretty good team.”"
The Jets and the Gregg Williams Gamble - The New York Times,"After a 4-12 season, the Jets were expected to overhaul their staff. But few expected the team to land perhaps the most controversial figure in the N.F.L. coaching ranks.","Enter Gregg Williams, the Jets’ new defensive coordinator, whose credentials include a Super Bowl ring with the New Orleans Saints in 2009; a surprisingly positive run as the interim coach of the Cleveland Browns this season; and, not to be forgotten, a role as the face of one of the ugliest scandals to tarnish the image of the N.F.L. in the last decade.","For the Jets, mired in one of their trademark periods of borderline irrelevance, he has been brought in to reform an undisciplined defense and counterbalance Adam Gase, the newly hired coach, who at 40 is one of the league’s youngest, most innovative offensive minds.","Williams’s reputation as a firebrand, however, carries significant risks for a franchise frequently plagued by off-field distraction.","Williams was at the heart of the scandal known as Bountygate, in which the Saints, with Williams as ringleader, offered payouts to players who injured opponents, according to a league investigation. The scandal resulted in plenty of hand-wringing over the sport’s relationship with brutality when it was trying to convince the public that it was taking seriously the mounting concerns about head injuries.","In March 2012, Williams received an indefinite suspension, the harshest of the penalties doled out, which included a one-year suspension for Saints Coach Sean Payton. Williams was reinstated in 2013.","In the years since, Williams, 60, has worked his way back into the defensive coordinator role seemingly without having lost much of his brashness or bravado. On HBO’s “Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Cleveland Browns” this past summer, Williams became something of a celebrity among Browns supporters, who took to his intensity and vulgar tirades. Williams liked to end defensive huddles with the phrase, “Come get some.”","“He’s not here to make you feel comfortable,” said the former linebacker Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who played for Williams in New Orleans and St. Louis. “He’s willing to ruffle your feathers.”",Williams is indeed a throwback to the era of football coach as force of nature. Gase’s introduction to the Jets was judged by some as notably subdued. But Williams thunders into a locker room like a gale.,"In Cleveland, where he was defensive coordinator for two seasons, he warned parents about bringing young children to training camp because of his propensity to yell obscenities. He admonished reporters for slouching in chairs. He trash-talked the matinee-idol quarterback Baker Mayfield.","Dunbar said practices were intensified by Williams’s insistence that any loose ball be treated like a turnover, at all times.","“Anytime a ball hits the ground, he wants you to pick it up,” Dunbar said. “Anytime a ball is overthrown, he wants you to act like it was an interception and return it.”",Dunbar added that players eventually became “conditioned to go after the ball.”,"It strikes some as just the sort of Type A personality that can light a fire under the Jets, who struggled under Coach Todd Bowles.","“They need a guy that can come and crack the whip — teach them football but also be very demanding,” said Bart Scott, a former Jets linebacker who is now a co-host of “The CMB Show” on WFAN. “He can teach them and give them the tools to be successful in different situations.”","The Jets have declined to make Williams available for interviews until after Gase’s full staff has been assembled. Gase also hired Dowell Loggains from the Miami Dolphins to be offensive coordinator, and kept the special-teams coordinator Brant Boyer.","In a recent interview on a Pro Football Talk podcast, Gase said he had known Williams for more than a decade.","“He did his time,” Gase said of Williams and the scandal in New Orleans. “He’s gotten a second chance, he’s done it right, he’s gone and worked extremely hard to do things the right way, and for me or anybody else to hold that over his head, to me, is wrong.”","Many Jets players expressed enthusiasm after Williams was hired. Safety Jamal Adams, at the Pro Bowl in Orlando, said he had already been watching videos of Williams’s teams on YouTube.","“He’s the best in the business,” Adams said. “I’ve had so many players hit me up to tell me how much I’m going to love Coach Gregg.”","One former player who may not share such sentiments is Peyton Manning, who recommended Gase, his former offensive coordinator in Denver, to the Jets. Williams once told a Nashville radio station that he wanted his defenders to put “remember me” hits on Manning, then the quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts.","Williams will probably bring at least one significant change to the defensive scheme. The Jets have used a 3-4 (three down linemen, four linebackers) base defense since Eric Mangini arrived in 2006. But Williams is known for his 4-3 format, which emphasizes speed rushers on the outside, something the Jets do not exactly have right now.","The team does have more than $100 million in cap space, so there should be flexibility to acquire a defensive end or two to fit Williams’s vision, which relies on the blitz.","“They’re going to be probably the most aggressive defense in the N.F.L.,” Dunbar said. “He’s going to bring pressure. He’s going to manufacture pressure.”","The Jets tried this approach under Rex Ryan, who took them to two consecutive A.F.C. championship games. It worked until it didn’t. Ryan coached the Jets for six years and was fired after the 2014 season, when he went too 4-12.","Williams’s demanding personality will be an adjustment for some players. Dunbar said another difficulty is how much information he throws at his players so they understand more than just their role in the defense — he wants them to know the whole orchestra, not just its parts.","“He wants his players to be more like coaches on the field than just robotic players,” Dunbar said. “He wants them to play with instinct and be able to call what they feel.”","To Scott, that is the type of coach the Jets need, controversy aside.","“He was the best hire available,” Scott said. “You have talented pieces. They just don’t know how to be great.”"
"Bob Kuechenberg, 71, Dies; Gritty Guard With Champion Dolphins - The New York Times","Bob Kuechenberg, a six-time Pro Bowl guard in the National Football League, two-time Super Bowl champion and member of the only N.F.L. team to achieve a perfect season, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, died on Saturday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 71.","His former wife, Marilyn Nix Kuechenberg, said the cause was a heart attack.","Kuechenberg joined the Dolphins as a free agent in 1970, the future Hall of Fame coach Don Shula’s first season, and played for them until 1983. He was part of a daunting offensive line that included guard Larry Little and center Jim Langer, both enshrined in the Hall of Fame.","The New York Times sportswriter Red Smith quoted Kuechenberg in 1975 on his strategy for neutralizing defenders, in this case the Chicago Bears tackle Wally Chambers. “I just fight him,” Kuechenberg said. “As long as he’s beating on my head and not the quarterback’s, it’s all right with me.”","Kuechenberg (pronounced KOOCH-en-berg) started every game for the 1972 Dolphins, who went 17-0, beating the Washington Redskins, 14-7, in Super Bowl VII at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He started 16 games during the 1973 season and playoffs when the Dolphins repeated as champions, blowing out the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7, in the Super Bowl at Rice Stadium in Houston.","The Dolphins overcame the vaunted Vikings defense, known as the Purple People Eaters, on the ground — the Dolphins’ quarterback, Bob Griese, attempted only seven passes — in no small part because of Kuechenberg’s work up front against Alan Page, the Vikings’ Hall of Fame defensive tackle.","In a statement after Kuechenberg’s death, Shula said his performance in Super Bowl VIII “was one of the keys to our victory.”","Kuechenberg was tough, even for an N.F.L. offensive lineman. He played with a fractured forearm in the Dolphins’ second Super Bowl victory, completed a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers with a broken ankle and played much of the 1977 season with two fractured bones in his back.","An eye injury ended Kuechenberg’s career after the 1983 season, during which he blocked for the rookie quarterback Dan Marino.","Kuechenberg played in 196 games with Miami, a team record that was later broken by Marino.","“He gave you everything he had every single snap, and that dependability extended throughout his career, missing only a few games during that time,” Shula said.","Robert John Kuechenberg was born on Oct. 14, 1947, in Gary, Ind., to Rudy and Marion Kuechenberg. He told The Palm Beach Post in 2005 that his father had been an iron worker, middleweight boxer, rodeo clown and human cannonball.","He grew up in Hobart, Ind., and graduated from Hobart High School in 1965 before studying economics and playing football at the University of Notre Dame.",Kuechenberg told The Palm Beach Post that his father (“the toughest guy I have ever known”) had motivated him to play through pain.,"“I’m the only one that I know of who made it in the N.F.L. whose father accused me of being a pussycat for taking the easy way out,” Kuechenberg said, referring to his college education and football career. “He basically said, ‘Either graduate from Notre Dame or get in the cannon.’”",“So a broken arm? That’s no big deal.”,"He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1969 and was chosen by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the N.F.L. draft. But he was released by the Eagles and then the Atlanta Falcons in his first season, which he finished with the Chicago Owls of the Continental Football League before joining the Dolphins.",He married his high school sweetheart while he was at Notre Dame. They later divorced.,"After retiring from the N.F.L., Kuechenberg ran fine arts and luxury real estate businesses. He also renovated houses in Florida with Ms. Nix Kuechenberg, whom he married in the early 1970s; one restoration was of a historic multimillion-dollar mansion on Star Island in Miami Beach. That marriage ended in divorce, as did his two subsequent ones.","His survivors include two children from his first marriage, Bryan and Eric; two from his second marriage, Nicholas and Alexandra Kuechenberg; one from his third marriage, Brandon; two grandchildren; and six siblings.","Kuechenberg was a repeat finalist for the Hall of Fame, in Canton, Ohio, but has not been elected to it.","“I’ve coached a lot of Hall of Fame players, including a number of offensive linemen, and Kooch was as good as any of them,” Shula said. “I hope one day he gets that ultimate recognition by being enshrined in Canton. It’s an honor long overdue.”"
"Opinion | The Meaning of Tony Romo, Super Bowl Psychic - The New York Times","The Super Bowl arrives and, with it, so many questions big and small. Is Tom Brady part cyborg and maybe even immortal? Will the Los Angeles Rams be hamstrung by the knowledge that they got this far by the grace of several sleepwalking referees?",How frequently will Tony Romo see the future? And might our fascination with that speak to a longing that reaches far beyond football?,"But first a quick primer on Romo, CBS’s dependably psychic commentator. Over the course of two seasons analyzing National Football League games from the broadcast booth, he has provided more than the usual blather and banter. He guesses what will happen next: blitz or no blitz, run or pass, involving this wide receiver or that tight end. He doesn’t do this for every play, but he does it repeatedly. And if he were picking stocks on Wall Street, he’d be a gazillionaire.","Romo hit peak prognostication when he announced the game two weeks ago in which Brady and the New England Patriots eked past the Kansas City Chiefs, earning yet another trip to the Super Bowl. He made 15 specific forecasts. Thirteen were correct. On the two occasions when the team on offense bucked Romo’s soothsaying, “the results were poor — one play ended with an incomplete pass, and the other with a turnover,” noted Zach Helfand in The New Yorker. “It seemed that, even when Romo was wrong, he was right.”","Romo, 38, previously spent more than a decade as a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. He was great but he wasn’t great, and with him as its leader, the team never went all the way. In a twist that’s testament to second acts in American lives, he’s doing something as a star for CBS that he never did as a star for the Cowboys: going to the Super Bowl. I suppose that’s fitting, because he’s more than great in his current gig. He’s peerless. And he’s a sensation.","So much so that after the Patriots-Chiefs game, reporters for The Wall Street Journal studied 46 hours of television footage from this past football season to review the 2,599 plays that Romo had provided live commentary for. Not even the Nixon Tapes got scrutiny like that. The Journal found 72 instances when Romo prophesied what a team was about to do. The team did what he said 68 percent of the time.",“A broadcasting phenomenon” is how The Journal describes Romo. Twitter calls him Romostradamus. Football fans gush about Romomania. And this is obviously about more than the novelty of his crystal ball.,"It’s about the rarity of his unquestionably deep knowledge in an era when so many of the people who put on the trappings of authority and peddle pearls of wisdom don’t actually have the goods. When so many opinions come with a swagger inversely proportional to their worth. When social media, cable channels, webcasts, podcasts, blogs and more have created an environment in which everybody’s an expert and nobody’s an expert — in which it’s sometimes impossible to tell.",With Romo you can tell. His verified foresight proves his genuine insight.,"As I’ve savored his genius and reflected on its appeal, I’ve flashed back to some comments that President Obama made to The New Yorker’s top editor, David Remnick, for a lengthy article in late November 2016 about his waning days in office. Obama was obsessed with the chaotic nature of this new information ecosystem. “Everything is true and nothing is true,” he told Remnick. “An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers’ payroll.”","I also flashed back to another article, by Amy Zegart, that appeared in The Atlantic the following summer. It defined the “three paradoxes disrupting American politics,” the first of which was “more information, less credibility.”","“The volume of data is exploding, and yet credible information is harder to find,” Zegart wrote. “Why? Because the barriers to entry are so low.” You don’t need a printing press, a book contract or the approval of some gatekeeper to have your say and share your thoughts. You just need an internet connection. And while there’s obvious benefit to that — judgment and permission aren’t the exclusive province of a discriminatory elite — there’s obvious danger, too. Good filters disappear with the bad ones. Cyberspace is at once a smorgasbord and a junkyard.","Romo’s habitat — network television — is old-fashioned, but that’s not what distinguishes and recommends him. His seriousness sets him apart. I don’t mean his style, which Helfand likened to “that of a 10-year-old who’s really into dinosaurs showing his uncle the T. rex exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History.” I mean his content. He played football recently and has studied it closely, so he understands what the athletes are thinking, what the coaches are plotting, what makes sense on third down and what doesn’t. He uses the days between the games that he’s announcing to bone up on the teams that will come under his gaze, even interviewing their members. While he comes by his charisma naturally, he makes it a point to be informed.","How refreshing, and what an excellent reminder he is that hugely successful athletes aren’t just physically gifted; they’re mentally tough, and many are smart. Their sports pivot on intricate strategy as much as brute strength. To the agile thinkers go the spoils. Ever listened to one of those LeBron James news conferences right after a basketball game? He remembers and can deconstruct every second of it. It’s all there in his brain.","Romo found glory aplenty on the football field, but he began to find even greater glory the minute he stepped off it in late 2016, with a farewell speech that was like the climactic monologue in one of those sports movies that has grown men working every last muscle and tendon in their faces not to cry.","“I just want to leave you with something I’ve learned in this process,” he said, referring to his quarterbacking years. “I feel like we all have two battles or two enemies going on. One with the man across from you. The second is with the man inside of you. I think once you control the one inside of you, the one across from you really doesn’t matter.”","Emotional intelligence along with clairvoyance: That’s no everyday combination. But then he’s no everyday oracle. You can tune in to the Super Bowl to marvel at Brady, chuckle over the commercials and gripe about the halftime show. Or you can come for Romo. He alone is lure enough. "
How Tom Brady Became New England’s Favorite Adopted Son - The New York Times,"Tom Brady, the five-time Super Bowl champion quarterback of the New England Patriots, came to Massachusetts via San Mateo, Calif., and the University of Michigan.","He is married to the supermodel Gisele Bündchen and has owned a luxury apartment in Manhattan, where their family spent much time in the off-season. He endorses UGG, the Australian apparel company, and he published a book about his life as a diet and health nut whose favorite dessert is a dairy-free avocado ice cream, a flavor not readily available at J.P. Licks or any other popular Boston ice cream haven.","Despite all of this, which would figure to turn off the people in a region known, perhaps unfairly, for its insularity and, perhaps fairly, for its hatred of pretension, Brady is now the most favorite son of New England. How he managed to pull that off, to become bigger than Ted Williams and Larry Bird, and even Big Papi, David Ortiz, has more to do with timing, some key lifestyle decisions and a certain fight with the N.F.L. over deflated footballs than his mounting collection of Super Bowl rings.","“If you were drawing a sports cartoon and it showed a train and each car in the train represented one of the recent Boston championships,” said Richard Johnson, the curator of the Sports Museum in Boston, “Brady would be the engineer in the front stoking the fire.”","Fans in 44 American states mostly despise Brady and pray to the football gods that his Patriots never win another playoff game. But in New England, it’s almost impossible to overstate Brady’s exalted standing. Putting Brady on par with a Kennedy might be a stretch, but not a huge one.","It’s also remarkable that at the end of a season that dawned with the potential for polarizing protests during the national anthem, sagging television ratings and other off-field controversies, it has instead all come back to Brady and his dominance. After nearly two decades, the N.F.L. remains his playground.","Partly because of that, the people of the New England region, who largely adopt all Boston teams, are living through an era of unusually high accomplishment: Their professional teams celebrate championships from season to season — as in spring to fall to winter. But in Boston, it always matters to have been the one who started a movement. And like Paul Revere dashing on horseback to ignite a revolution, Brady led the charge that ushered New England sports into the 21st century, and it has been a procession of duck-boat parades down Boylston Street past Boston Common ever since.",[An illustrated guide to the N.F.L. playoffs.],"Brady’s Patriots won the franchise’s first Super Bowl title at the end of the 2001 N.F.L. season. That was about three years before the 2004 Red Sox reversed the curse with their first World Series victory since 1918, and long before the 2008 Celtics finally escaped Bird’s shadow and won their first N.B.A. championship in more than 20 years. And it was a decade before the 2011 Bruins won the franchise’s first Stanley Cup since 1972.","Throughout that time, Brady’s Patriots kept winning. And while there have been other recent, treasured sports heroes in Boston, most notably the still ubiquitous Ortiz, consider this: When the origin story of Boston’s 21st century sports resurrection is told, whose name will be mentioned first?","Brady managed to ingratiate himself to the locals quickly when he arrived in 2000. His first home, symbolically, was in Quincy, Mass., a diverse city-suburb where two New England institutions, Dunkin’ Donuts and Howard Johnson’s restaurants, were founded.","He was a familiar sight back then, piling groceries in a cart and chatting with other customers at the Quincy Stop & Shop. Restaurants and bars there grew accustomed to seeing him on dates, and even grew protective of him when those outings attracted paparazzi.","Another factor that made Brady not just a favorite son of the region but the focal point of a rebellious, us-against-them cause was the bizarre spectacle that came to be known as Deflategate. Not surprisingly, us-against-them has been ingrained in the New England DNA ever since a lot of tea ended up in Boston Harbor about 246 years ago.","In 2015, when Brady and the Patriots were investigated by the N.F.L. for using deflated footballs to gain an unfair advantage — with Brady eventually suspended and, by association, labeled a cheater (in roughly 44 states) — New Englanders were outraged by what they saw as outsiders’ bias.","“The allegiance to Brady is deep and all the more intense because of the shared feeling he was unfairly stigmatized,” said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author, historian and longtime New England resident. “Deflategate put Brady’s entire reputation and legacy at risk. Fans here still battle the nonissue with fans elsewhere, and it makes us love him all the more.”","Goodwin added that she was recently at a bar in the Philadelphia airport, and everyone except her and one other patron wanted Brady to lose on Sunday.","During Deflategate, there was an infamous, ghoulish 2015 courtroom sketch made of Brady as he took part in a federal proceeding. Patriots fans were incensed that the handsome Brady had been rudely denigrated.","The courtroom artist apologized repeatedly and created another, more favorable sketch.","There are, of course, two other obvious reasons that Brady’s status in New England has been amplified, and they would probably bring him unbridled admiration in any pro sports community.","He holds the records for most N.F.L. victories as a starting quarterback (207), most playoff wins (29), most Super Bowl victories by a player (five) and most Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Awards (four).","That will breed a lot of loyalty. Brady, for example, is 41 and has been in the N.F.L. for 19 years. You might think that any fan who wanted a replica of his No. 12 jersey would have purchased one by now.",Apparently not.,"Merchandise bearing Brady’s name was the top-selling N.F.L. apparel item this season, with the Boston market driving sales. Since the Patriots clinched their berth in Sunday’s Super Bowl, Brady merchandise has been selling faster — by 40 percent — than it did in the week before any of his previous eight Super Bowl appearances, according to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports merchandise.",He is also married to one of the highest paid models in the world. There is little doubt that part of Brady’s crossover appeal is the understanding that he is the rare N.F.L. superstar whose spouse may be more famous than he is.,"Brady is chasing his sixth Super Bowl championship and seems to have secured his spot on the Boston sports version of Mount Rushmore. There is still room there for Williams, Bill Russell and (genuflect) Bobby Orr. Fans of Bird will make their case.","But the only person who could possibly unseat Brady is Bill Belichick, who admittedly already has a face of stone. He first landed in New England as a teenager during a postgraduate year at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., then attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.","Realistically, no one is likely to eclipse Brady. Two years ago, a Boston cultural museum unveiled a Brady wax figure (next to dozens of nonsports icons of the area). The representation of Brady was deemed creepy, and elicited more ire and wrath than the unworthy courtroom sketch did.","Which means only one thing: In five or 10 years, when civic leaders erect a Tom Brady statue, they better get the visage right. And drape him in his No. 12 jersey."

How Offense Took Over the N.F.L.  - The New York Times,"The 1,371 touchdowns scored in the 2018 N.F.L. regular season were the most for a single season in the 99-year history of the league. Quarterbacks threw more touchdown passes than ever. For the first time, both teams in a regulation game scored 50 or more points. Dozens of individual and team offensive records fell as players raced up and down the field, apparently to the delight of fans, because the N.F.L.’s television ratings spiked substantially.","Fittingly, and not surprisingly, the four teams that remain in the hunt for a berth in the Super Bowl — the New Orleans Saints, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots — scored the most points this season.","But the recent offensive explosion in the N.F.L. didn’t just happen in the past year, nor did productive, pass-happy, fast-paced offensive schemes materialize in a vacuum. Instead, for roughly four decades (or the life span of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady), a series of innovations, minirevolutions, bold strategies from pioneering coaches and the purposeful rule changes by the N.F.L. led to the unprecedented 2018 season.",And it was on this path that the four starting quarterbacks in Sunday’s conference championships games — two in their 40s and two in their early 20s — were also shaped.,Here is a timeline of how the N.F.L. dragged itself from its low-scoring past to one of its wildest seasons ever.,"The N. F. L. makes it illegal for defenders to make significant contact with a wide receiver once he is more than 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The league also loosens its restrictions on offensive linemen, allowing blockers to extend their arms and open their hands while protecting the quarterback on pass plays.","Capitalizing on the new rules, Don Coryell, in his first year coaching the San Diego Chargers, installs a downfield-pass-oriented offense that spawns disciples for years to come. The offense, known as Air Coryell and helmed by quarterback Dan Fouts, now a Hall of Famer, leads the N.F.L. in passing from 1978 to 1983.","The new rules enacted in 1978 have a vast effect. In 1980, teams pass the football 47 percent of the time, compared with just 38 percent in 1977. The number of points scored per game jumps to 41, from 34.4 in 1977.","Behind the innovative short-passing  scheme of Coach Bill Walsh, the San Francisco 49ers win their first Super Bowl. Walsh’s complex, horizontal offense relies on multiple wideout sets and ever-changing backfield formations. Called the West Coast offense, Walsh’s system is copied leaguewide after the 49ers win the Super Bowl two more times in the 1980s.","Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche institutes a radical no-huddle offense, and his Super Bowl-bound Bengals lead the N.F.L. in points, yards gained, first downs and yards per passing attempt. Before each snap, quarterback Boomer Esiason, the league most valuable player, reads the defense and alters the play call, presaging the elaborate presnap adjustments made by Peyton Manning and Brady years later.","The University of Houston brings the run-and-shoot offense into the football mainstream. The pass-first scheme, popularized by Mouse Davis at Portland State in the late 1970s, is predicated on the quarterback and his four receivers reading and reacting to coverages. The Cougars set 26 N.C.A.A. records, and Andre Ware becomes the first black quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy, throwing for 4,699 yards and 44 touchdowns.","Buffalo unveils its famed K-Gun offense in a 30-23 victory against Philadelphia. Operating out of the shotgun, quarterback Jim Kelly calls plays without huddling, spreading the ball in three-receiver sets. Behind its electrifying offense, Buffalo advances to its first of four consecutive Super Bowls.","The N.F.L. renews its emphasis on prohibiting defensive backs from jamming receivers more than 5 yards downfield, and passing statistics climb.","In his senior year, Brees leads Purdue to last-minute upsets over Ohio State and Michigan, helping the Boilermakers clinch their first Big Ten title in more than 30 years. Brees, who threw for 3,668 yards with 36 touchdowns and just 12 interceptions, sets two N.C.A.A. records, 13 Big Ten records and 19 Purdue records. But because he operated a spread offense, his passing statistics are devalued by N.F.L. analysts, who remain uncertain of his pro potential. Brees’s height (6 feet) is also expected to hurt his prospects.","In the fourth quarter of New England’s 10-3 loss to the Jets, linebacker Mo Lewis levels Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe near the sideline, knocking him out of the game with a sheared blood vessel in his chest. Bledsoe plays one more series before being replaced by Brady. Bledsoe never regains his starting job for New England.","Five months after replacing Bledsoe, Brady wins his first Super Bowl, 20-17, over the favored St. Louis Rams, whose league-leading offense was called The Greatest Show on Turf. ","New England advances to the Super Bowl after winning, 24-14, in Indianapolis in a game with leaguewide ramifications. After the Patriots followed Coach Bill Belichick’s orders to hit Colts receivers hard every chance they could, the N.F.L. responds by having officials emphasize defensive holding and illegal-contact calls, forcing defenders to be cautious about touching receivers beyond 5 yards.","Texas Tech’s Air Raid offense system, developed by Coach Mike Leach, gains renown when the Red Raiders score 70 points in victories over Nebraska and Texas Christian. Texas Tech’s Kliff Kingsbury becomes the third college quarterback to throw for 10,000 yards. Part of the ingenuity of the Air Raid offense is its simplicity (there are eight basic plays) and its sophistication (there are countless outcomes based on options that stress ball distribution, spacing and tempo).","In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which forces the Saints to spend the 2005 season on the road, the franchise regroups by hiring Sean Payton as coach and, two months later, signing Brees, a free agent, to a six-year contract. Payton, an aggressive play-caller, and Brees, the most accurate quarterback in N.F.L. history, embark on a fruitful partnership. It produces a Super Bowl title three years later, 118 regular-season victories (second among quarterback-coach combinations to Belichick and Brady in the Super Bowl era) and a template, 11 years later, for a young coach and his quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams to follow.","On the Patriots’ 15th offensive snap of the season, Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard lunges at Brady as he releases a pass, causing the quarterback’s left leg to bend awkwardly. The unpenalized hit leaves Brady with two torn knee ligaments. After the season, the N.F.L. adjusts more rules, accelerating the passing explosion. The league bars defenders on the ground from lunging at a quarterback’s lower legs and agrees to assess a 15-yard penalty for hitting defenseless receivers in the head, a move that further allows them to catch the ball over the middle without fear.","Brees sets a season record with 5,476 passing yards, and Brady surpasses 5,000 for the first time. Brady develops a strong on-field rapport with Rob Gronkowski, who in his second season epitomizes the new breed of tight ends,  who create unsolvable matchup problems with speed and size. Travis Kelce of the Chiefs is another such tight end. ","Reid, who had developed a reputation as a quarterback whisperer, is named head coach in Kansas City. He was an offensive assistant  in Green Bay in the 1990s, when Brett Favre led the Packers to two Super Bowls and won three league M.V.P. awards. By 1999, Reid was coach in Philadelphia, where he promptly drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb, who led the Eagles to five N.F.C. championship games. Four years after joining the Chiefs, Reid is instrumental in the team’s decision to focus much of their predraft attention on Mahomes.","Goff enrolls at California to play for  Coach Sonny Dykes, who assisted Leach at Texas Tech, where Dykes coached Welker. Running the Bear Raid — Cal’s version of the Air Raid — Goff, as a true freshman, sets several program passing records.","At Whitehouse High School in Texas, Mahomes passes for 3,587 yards with 41 touchdowns and four interceptions while running the Air Raid offense. Mahomes throws for 597 yards in his final game before heading to Texas Tech to play in the Air Raid system once again.","Five months before Manning breaks the season record for touchdown passes (55) and passing yards (5,477), the N.F.L. draft indicates where the league is trending. For the first time since 1963, no running back is taken in the first round. It happens again in 2014.","In what may have been a response to how Seattle’s defensive backs stifled Manning’s Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl, the N.F.L. emphasizes enforcing illegal-contact rules in the secondary for the first time in seven years. As a result, illegal-contact penalties soar, to an average of 3.31 per team from 1.19 in 2013, according to  nflpenalties.com. Defensive-holding penalties also increase, to an average of 7.34 per team from 5.66. Offenses capitalize on the new rules, throwing more touchdown passes (804) and completing a greater percentage of passes (62.6) than ever before.","The Rams, seeking to better develop Goff, hire Sean McVay as coach. At 30 years 11 months 19 days, McVay becomes the youngest coach in the N.F.L.’s modern era.","Brady wins his fifth Super Bowl, as the Patriots overcome a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons. He completes 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earns him Super Bowl M.V.P. honors for the fourth time.","Under McVay’s tutelage, Goff blossoms, completing 62.1 percent of his passes for 3,804 yards and 28 touchdowns, as the Rams morph from the lowest-scoring team in the N.F.L. to the highest. McVay’s offense, heavy on play-action and screens and condensed alignments for receivers, is built for misdirection. His preferred personnel grouping — three receivers, one running back, one tight end — rarely deviates, but McVay confuses opponents by changing tempos, alignments and motions. Many of the Rams’ passing plays resemble runs, and vice versa. ","The Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 Super Bowl victory over New England is an inflection point in the offensive revolution. It features the most combined yards in an N.F.L. game (1,151), and Brady throws for a Super Bowl-record 505 yards. The signature moment — a trick play called Philly Special — reinforces the appreciation of coaches’ ingenuity at the lower levels. The Eagles plucked the play from the 2016 Chicago Bears, but, according to The MMQB, it originated at a South Carolina high school in 2011 and had also been run by, among others, Clemson and Westlake High School in Austin, Tex. — the alma mater of Drew Brees and Eagles quarterback Nick Foles.","The N.F.L.’s latest attempts to regulate safety have an intended consequence of protecting its most valuable assets, its quarterbacks, and serve as prelude to a record-shattering season. The rule changes generate celebration from offensive players and fury from defenders, who are barred from initiating contact with their helmets by lowering their heads. The league emphasizes to officials that defenders cannot use their body weight to land on the quarterback as they are bringing him to the ground — or, well, ever, really. It also clarifies what constitutes a catch, acknowledging that players do not have to control the ball to the ground.","The aerial explosion enveloping the N.F.L. sends teams scurrying for coaches who can mold desultory offenses into the next Chiefs, Patriots, Rams or Saints. Coaches, in other words, like McVay. Eight jobs open, and of the six hires that have been announced, five have offensive backgrounds, including Green Bay’s Matt LaFleur, who spent the 2017 season as McVay’s offensive coordinator, and Arizona’s Kingsbury, who developed Mahomes at Texas Tech. The Cincinnati Bengals are expected to hire Zac Taylor, Goff’s quarterback coach, after the Rams’ season ends. "
Foxboro(ugh!): Where Visiting N.F.L. Teams Hate to Play - The New York Times,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — In the N.F.L. community, one word might be feared more than any other: Foxborough.","It is where the rosy Super Bowl dreams of visiting teams die a frosty death each January. It is where the New England Patriots, before a raucous southeastern Massachusetts home crowd, rarely lose a playoff game (this century’s postseason record there is 19-3). ","It is where N.F.L. road teams are not only defeated, but rejected under peculiar circumstances. See: Deflategate, Tom Brady and the tuck rule.","How did out-of-the way, small-town Foxborough, of all places, come to be synonymous with heartache in N.F.L. cities from coast to coast while blossoming into a shrine to comprehensive Patriots glory?","The Patriots, after all, came to Foxborough in 1971 only because no one else wanted them. It helped that the stadium land, 30 miles south of Boston, was free.",[N.F.L. Playoff Coverage: Patriots Dominate Chargers to Reach A.F.C. Championship Game]," Foxborough (population: 17,000) remains firmly rooted in its pre-Patriots past, with dairy cows visible from the top of Gillette Stadium. More than that, Foxborough is the oddest place to bear witness to recurring N.F.L. history, simply because no one here can agree on how to spell the town’s name.","Since 1778, by decree, in all authorized documents and on all town buildings, it has been spelled Foxborough. But almost immediately after that became official, many institutions in the town — banks, businesses, even the local newspaper — decided it was easier to go by Foxboro. In a quintessential example of New England persistence, the argument has endured for centuries: There are now signs with both spellings throughout the village.","However the name is spelled, Foxborough residents know their little municipality is renowned far and wide.","“I’ve done training across the country,” Tom Buckley, the town’s deputy fire chief, said. “When I’m asked where I live, I never mention the Patriots. I just say Foxborough. And instantly, everyone starts talking to me about the Patriots and how they always win there.","“Does that happen with any other N.F.L. team? I mean, I don’t know where the Miami Dolphins play, even though I know it’s not Miami.” ","The Patriots, unbeaten in their last eight home playoff games, will put that streak on the line Sunday afternoon against the Los Angeles Chargers in an A.F.C. divisional playoff game. The Patriots, who have won five Super Bowls since the 2001 season, have had, for them, an uneven season, losing five of eight away games. But they were the only N.F.L. team to be 8-0 at home, a substantial source of pride in Foxborough.","“In the town, we feel like we bring a different type of energy at those home games,” David Tynan, a longtime Foxborough resident, said on Wednesday outside the town’s primary grocery store. “Game days are like holidays. By kickoff, the streets are quiet — you’re either at the stadium or inside watching the game.”","Because there are few hills, trees or other buildings near Gillette Stadium, the landscape is windswept in January and bracing, with temperatures typically in the 20s. The Patriots intentionally built their practice facility adjacent to the stadium, and they almost always practice outside,  acclimating to the elements in a way that their playoff opponents — from mostly warmer regions — cannot. The atmosphere in Gillette Stadium is also especially hostile to visiting teams, as Patriots home crowds are considered among the most vociferous in the N.F.L.","Rich Noonan, a lieutenant in the Police Department and a fifth-generation native of Foxborough, recalled the town’s blue-collar origins and said area fans “were protecting their home turf.”","Noonan laughed, and added: “But so much has changed. When I was a kid, they couldn’t give away tickets. They opened the stadium gates at halftime and let anyone in.”","Indeed, the Patriots’ earliest days in Foxborough were as undistinguished as their first 11 years as the vagabond Boston Patriots of the American Football League. Beginning in 1960, those unheralded Patriots practiced on grassless high school fields and played games at Boston University, Harvard University, Boston College and Fenway Park. With the A.F.L.-N.F.L. merger in 1970, the Patriots needed a sizable stadium as a permanent home, and after talks with Boston city leaders repeatedly broke down, Billy Sullivan, the team’s owner, welcomed an offer from Bay State Raceway, which donated land next to its facility for a 60,000-seat stadium.","The Patriots won their first game at the stadium in 1971, although thousands of ticket holders never saw a single play because they were stuck for the entirety of the game in gridlock traffic that crammed Route 1, the only access road to the stadium.","Shortly after the first game, the local health board closed Schaefer Stadium because of malfunctioning toilets. Various solutions were tried, including an exercise that enlisted hundreds of volunteers to flush all of the stadium toilets simultaneously — a tactic referred to as Super Flush in the local news media. Fans came up with another name for the site: the Toilet Bowl.","“It was a nightmare at times,” Jack Authelet, the Foxborough town historian, said. “The stadium would be closed, it would get a reprieve for one game, and then there would be another closing. Another last-minute reprieve would allow a game to be played, then it would close again. This went on week after week.”"," When the games did go on, the crowds drank heavily, so much so that Foxborough prohibited the stadium from hosting “Monday Night Football” because of the  tumult that ensued after dark. And when the Patriots were not playing, the stadium hosted dozens of rock concerts, where pervasive drug and alcohol use caused nearby hospitals to fill with patients.","Foxborough, with a pastoral common at its center, was wondering what it had gotten itself into. But over time, and with some prudent strategizing, the traffic problems diminished. ","Restrictions on events were imposed to make them safer and calmer. The Sullivan family lost control of the team, and the stadium was renamed Foxboro Stadium — not Foxborough — and by 1994, the businessman Robert K. Kraft had bought the team. Kraft knew he needed a modern stadium, and in 1998 seriously flirted with taking the Patriots to Hartford. ","Eventually, a deal was struck to build what is now Gillette Stadium, next to the site of the old stadium. The Patriots won their first Super Bowl in an upset months before Gillette Stadium opened in 2002. The last game at Foxboro Stadium was a controversial, come-from-behind, overtime playoff victory known as the Tuck Rule Game, in which an apparent New England fumble became an incomplete pass and saved the day for the Patriots. The home Foxborough magic was born.","“All of a sudden, we had the Super Bowl champions and a real professional stadium,” said Mike Kelleher, a lifelong Foxborough resident and the town’s incoming fire chief. “That’s when everything changed around here. Before a 1 o’clock game, we would see every parking lot totally full with tailgaters by 10 a.m.”",The vibe was transformed. The home victories became a badge of honor for the locals.,"“Now you hear it all the time: This is Foxborough; the Patriots don’t lose here,” said Waylon Krueger, who moved from Buffalo three years ago. “It’s a given. Look, I’m a Bills fan. I wish we had that.”","Hosting the Patriots has also been enormously helpful for the town’s municipal budget, even though the stadium site is just a sliver of Foxborough along commercially dense Route 1, where Kraft’s holding company constructed a mall next to the stadium.","Foxborough receives a portion of each ticket sold to events at Gillette Stadium, which amounts to $2.5 million to $3 million annually, according to the town manager, William Keegan. That total is at least doubled by other taxes generated by the Patriots’ presence in town. In addition, the Patriots make six-figure charitable donations annually to Foxborough.","In the last 10 to 15 years, the town’s demographic makeup has been altered. Foxborough has had an influx of home buyers with corporate jobs who commute to Boston and Providence, R.I., which is a little more than 20 miles to the south. Larger homes have sprouted on tree-lined streets, some of them aimed at housing millionaire football players employed nearby.","More than half the Patriots’ roster lives in Foxborough, and many other players live in surrounding towns.","“I’m impressed with the intensity of the fan support in Foxborough; it’s almost like a college football town,” said Patriots center David Andrews, who lives in town. “And people make us feel welcome. They invite us to their homes for the holidays.”","Because it is inescapable, Andrews has noticed the town’s dual spelling. But he would not wade into the 241-year-old squabble over it. ","The dispute may not rise to the level of  bar fights, but there are strong opinions.","“You spell it long or you spell it wrong,” said Buckley, whose firefighter’s uniform has a Foxborough patch.","Authelet, the town historian, supports the longer spelling as well. But the license plate on his car reads: FOXBRO.","Massachusetts allows personalized plates to have no more than six letters, so he did the best he could.","A few years ago, Authelet was waiting in his car at a stoplight in Philadelphia when another car pulled alongside. The driver honked his horn and held up a sign.","“The guy had written on a piece of paper: Cheaters,” Authelet said, well aware of the rules controversies christened Spygate and Deflategate that have dogged Coach Bill Belichick’s team through the years.","“That kind of reaction happens; it’s a fact,” Authelet said with a smile. “But most people tell me that I live in a sports lover’s paradise where the home team almost always wins.",“A lot of towns would like to trade places.”
Will Defense Doom the Chiefs in the Playoffs? - The New York Times,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The last time the Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs, the day broke sunny and mild, with barely a breeze. On his drive to Arrowhead Stadium that January morning in 2004, Kansas City quarterback Trent Green, hoping that a rainy chill would greet the visitors from a domed stadium, rued the weather.","“I knew we would have to score a bunch of points,” Green said.","The Chiefs, the highest-scoring team in the N.F.L., did: 31, a nick above their season average, and never punted. Neither, though, did the Colts. With Peyton Manning operating in ideal conditions, they scored 38.","If what’s past is prologue, especially for a franchise with a postseason ledger as ghastly as Kansas City’s, then the Chiefs who will face Indianapolis in the divisional round on Saturday at Arrowhead are at risk of continuing a trend that doomed them 15 years ago.",The team that wrecked the N.F.L. with an offense so potent that it recalibrated how football is played in 2018 — scoring the most points and gaining the most yards and throwing the most touchdowns — also fielded one of the worst defenses that has ever made the playoffs.,[Read our predictions for the divisional round.],"The Chiefs’ defense finished last or second-to-last in passing yards (4,374), total yards (6,488) and yards per rush (5.0). The Chiefs gave up the most first downs ever, with 419. And though they ranked 24th in points ceded, with 421, only three other teams since 1990, when the playoffs expanded to include six teams from each conference, gave up that many and still advanced to the postseason.","According to Pro Football Reference, only 13 of the other 173 teams to reach the playoffs since 1990 have fared worse than the Chiefs in at least one of those statistical categories, including Green’s group from the 2003 season, which allowed 5.2 yards per carry. Aside from Kansas City, the only others to earn a No. 1 seed were Green Bay and New England in 2011, and neither won the Super Bowl. In fact, only one of the 13 — excluding the 2018 Rams, who allowed the most yards per rush this season — won a championship: the 2006 Colts, whose strong pass defense offset their generosity against the run.","Plus, they had that Manning guy.","The Chiefs have a guy, too — Patrick Mahomes — and that’s a pretty strong counterargument. But it’s not an impenetrable one, as losses to the Chargers (Kansas City led by 14 with less than nine minutes left) and the Seahawks (Seattle ran for 210 yards) proved.","It’s difficult identifying a historical analogue to the 2018 Chiefs, a team of such extremes. The closest might be the 2011 Packers, whose leading receiver, Greg Jennings, recognized the similarities at once. Like the Chiefs, Green Bay created a load of turnovers — a league-high 38 — while also scoring the most points. The Packers also gave up more passing yards and total yards than Kansas City did this season.","“The defense recognized it more than even we did as an offense,” Jennings, now an analyst for Fox, said of the imbalance. “What needed to be done was what we did. We recognized it and we had to make up for it.”","The Packers went 15-1 before sputtering in their first playoff game, against the Giants, whose offensive coordinator, Kevin Gilbride, as could be expected, cared only about Green Bay’s schemes and personnel and not its defensive rankings. He said those were skewed by all the yardage they allowed when leading. Three weeks after exploiting the Packers’ blitzes, the Giants sustained long drives that “were almost as important as scoring,” Gilbride said, to batter New England’s defense in the Super Bowl. Both defenses, he said, outclassed the Chiefs’.","“Oh, no question,” said Gilbride, who has analyzed Kansas City’s game film as part of his prep work for NBC’s broadcasts. “I think they’re vulnerable.”","The Chiefs, for their part, seem aware of their inadequacies, especially in the secondary and at linebacker. Gilbride noted how the team’s defensive coordinator, Bob Sutton, has tried concealing them with deception, by mixing coverage schemes or calling more two high safety looks, intended to protect them against deep passes.","Their strength is their pass-rush, which registered 52 sacks, and that just might be their path to glory. This season has demonstrated that the Chiefs’ defense need not always play well — it needs to play well only at certain times.","Forcing turnovers and pressuring the quarterback are more important than preventing yardage. The Eagles’ Super Bowl victory against New England offered convincing evidence; the teams combined for a single punt, and the game turned on Philadelphia’s only sack, producing its only takeaway. The Chiefs’ 54-51 loss to the Rams this season, in a game with three defensive touchdowns, reinforced it.","“Maybe you’re not playing as well as you’d like on defense,” Sutton said, “but you know, hey, we can rise up here and we get a stop here and a stop here, our offense can take care of this.”","The offense has been so productive that the Chiefs have been ahead for 64.8 percent of the time they’ve been on the field — and by 11 points, or two possessions, more than half that time. They’ve played a staggering 799 defensive snaps when leading — 100 more than the next closest team, Chicago, according to Pro Football Reference.","When trailing, offenses tend to throw more often, and against defenses willing to keep the play in front of them by conceding yardage. Green, an analyst for CBS, characterized Sutton’s philosophy as “bend don’t break,” though the Chiefs’ defense broke in their playoff loss last year, allowing three second-half touchdowns to Tennessee. And in their playoff loss two years ago, allowing 171 rushing yards to Pittsburgh but not a touchdown. And in their playoff loss five years ago, allowing 35 second-half points that erased a 38-10 third-quarter lead.","That fiasco came against the Colts, too, but in Indianapolis. Reflecting on the Chiefs’ flop 15 years ago, Green blamed the offense — he missed some throws, a penalty negated a touchdown, a lost fumble erased Priest Holmes’s 48-yard run. He emphasized that he never once believed that the defense would constrain them.","“We felt we could score on anybody,” Green said.","Same with these Chiefs. They tallied at least 30 points in 12 of 16 games and averaged 32.4 at Arrowhead, where they closed the season by throttling Oakland, 35-3, in a performance that safety Eric Murray said felt “more cohesive” and “less segmented.”","Murray said he was encouraged, but he will not know for sure until Saturday, when the Chiefs embark on a journey that, if it ends with confetti falling on them at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta, will have defied nearly 30 years of statistical trends.","Green still lives around here, and curious, he checked the game day forecast the other night: snow showers, mid-30s, 10-to-15-m.p.h. winds. He said he turned to his wife and laughed.","“I was like, ‘Why couldn’t we have had this weather back then?’”"
"Colin Kaepernick Is Silenced by a Settlement, but His Knee Spoke Volumes - The New York Times","So a compelling two-year run of American political and cultural theater comes to a deeply unsatisfying conclusion. Colin Kaepernick, a once brilliant young quarterback, chose to take a knee for his beliefs and endured apparent blackballing by the most powerful sports league in North America.","It would be churlish to criticize this man for taking an unspecified financial settlement and signing a nondisclosure agreement with the National Football League after he had accused the league’s teams of colluding to keep him out. He sacrificed for his beliefs and with a dignified use of free speech, that grandest of American traditions, he came to personify a coming of political age across several sports.","He persevered despite sprays of vitriol from this nation’s president, Donald J. Trump, who in 2017 used the specter of this black man to stir resentments.","“Wouldn’t you love to see one of those N.F.L. owners, when someone disrespects our flag, to say: ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’ ” Trump told a crowd in Alabama.",It was catnip for the vastly white crowds that roared in disgust over Kaepernick.,"It is galling that Kaepernick and his former teammate Eric Reid, who joined him in the protest and legal action, must remain mum about the corruptions of the industrial complex known as the N.F.L. The owners almost certainly conspired to blackball Kaepernick, ensuring that he would never throw another pass in the league.","As he sought to sign on with a new team for the season after his protest began, and less than five years after he had taken the 49ers to the Super Bowl, owners came up with ever more pathetic excuses for refusing to sign a quarterback so swift and so strong of arm.",Now he can say nothing about that travesty. It feels a bit like the Freedom Riders integrating a lunch counter and agreeing not to talk about it.,"I called Ira Glasser, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union who is also a deep-dyed sports fan. He resolutely declined to second-guess Kaepernick for surveying the ruin of his career and probably taking a large chunk of money.","“He was a star who burst upon the scene explosively, and maybe he extracted as much justice as he could from this situation,” Glasser said. “But it does leave a stain on the N.F.L. that ought not to be eradicated in the public mind.”","Kaepernick did not burn a flag or even hold a proud fist aloft. It’s a measure of the subtle nature of his protest that fans and sportswriters went three preseason games before they noticed that, oh yeah, Kaepernick was sitting out the national anthem.","When they asked the young quarterback about it, he talked about police brutality and too many dead black Americans: “To me this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.”","In the next game and thereafter, Kaepernick took a knee instead, at the suggestion of a military veteran. Yet the whirlwind of anger somehow gained in force.","In the first weeks of that season, I flew to San Francisco to draw his measure. To step into the 49ers postgame locker room was to find a remarkably composed man with the support of many teammates. He walked out of the shower that night and slipped a form-fitting shirt over a lithe, tattooed torso. Then he turned to a bristling array of microphones and cameras and calmly answered every question.","Are you proud, a reporter asked him, of your role in stirring players around the N.F.L. — several knelt or raised fists Sunday during the various anthems — to protest? Kaepernick, a new arrival to the world of political activism, shook his head. No airs, man, no airs.","“No, no,” he said. “This movement wasn’t for me. As I’ve researched these things, as I’ve seen more and more, it’s not right.”",He spoke instead of how social media and reading and looking at photographs online had driven home to him how many blacks were dying at the hands of the police.,"“You see things instantly, day after day, and it’s hard,” he told us before citing some of the casualties. “For me, I couldn’t see another hashtag Sandra Bland, hashtag Tamir Rice, hashtag Walter Scott.”","“At what point,” he continued, “do we take a stand?”","It was dissent, yes, and as unthreatening and American as you could find in a country so often given over now to partisan furies. As Glasser, the civil libertarian, said to me Friday, “If that’s not acceptable to this country, what is it that we are supposed to be fighting for?”","Colin Kaepernick the football player may soon move into history’s mists. Kaepernick the human rights activist, the man Amnesty International named an ambassador of conscience, may just be coming into his own.",You hope only that this young man walked away with a mother lode from the league without shame.
Aaron Donald Doesn’t Look Like a Defensive Tackle. So He Reinvented the Position. - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — The Rams selected defensive tackle Aaron Donald with their second first-round pick in 2014, No. 13 over all, which means that 11 other teams, after assembling draft boards and consulting scouts and analyzing a trilogy’s worth of film of his demolishing offensive linemen, decided against taking a player whose dominance has since redefined his position.","“I think,” said Mike Waufle, the Rams’ defensive line coach at the time, “people were scared of his size.”","Donald is 6-foot-1 and, coming out of the University of Pittsburgh, was listed at 285 pounds. That is enormous in human terms, but smallish for a defensive tackle, whose function in a 3-4 defense is to blot out the sun.","Not everyone with the Rams coveted Donald, but Waufle was undeterred. He had long prized speed over size, and from the start, he viewed Donald as an outlier, grading him as the best prospect he had seen since 1998, his first season coaching in the N.F.L. Donald generated so much power that he reminded Waufle of the Russian boxer Ivan Drago in “Rocky IV,” who punched a computerized meter with such force that Drago’s manager remarked, “Whatever he hits, he destroys.”","In his first season, Donald was selected as the top defensive rookie. Last season, he was defensive player of the year. After registering 20.5 sacks this season, the most ever by a defensive tackle, Donald will almost certainly repeat.","The Rams’ ascent to a Super Bowl berth against the New England Patriots on Sunday from 4-12 buffoonery in 2016 reflects a certain harmonic convergence — the confluence of foresight, audacity and good fortune, with Donald embodying it all.","Coach Sean McVay, a brilliant communicator whose football acumen pushed the Rams to the forefront of the league’s offensive frenzy, has already spawned a coaching tree, and the team has traded precious draft picks to acquire volatile personalities who have meshed in a cohesive locker room. But before all that, the Rams had the conviction to draft Donald. In 2014, he was an excellent defender. In 2019, he is the avatar for defensive disruption.","With N.F.L. teams eschewing downfield passes for underneath routes, and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady averaging a mere 2.18 seconds per postseason throw in the pocket, according to Pro Football Focus, interior pressure is ever more critical. And no one plows into the backfield faster than Donald, a player New England Coach Bill Belichick called “pretty much unblockable.”","“If he keeps this up,” the Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle said, “he can change the game almost like a Lawrence Taylor.”","Randle transformed the position, too, playing at 6-1 and 285 pounds, but in a different era, when teams prioritized space-choking interior tackles to stop the run and tended to harass quarterbacks from the outside. Of the 54 instances in which a player had at least 16.5 sacks in a season since the statistic was first tracked in 1982, 50 came from defenders who didn’t play tackle, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.","Randle never quite reached that total, topping out at 15.5. But contemporaries like La’Roi Glover and Warren Sapp did, and Randle viewed them, and himself, as misfits, fueled by the perception that they weren’t fast enough to play linebacker, big enough to play offensive line or nimble enough to play running back.","Across 14 seasons with Minnesota and Seattle, Randle amassed the most sacks by a defensive tackle in N.F.L. history — 137.5 — by destroying quarterbacks and game plans much as Donald does now, just with less time to get to the quarterback. Donald had a league-leading 106 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. The next closest player, Fletcher Cox of Philadelphia, had 95.","“When you get that interior pressure, they can’t run the sweep, the center can’t pull,” Randle said. “When you’re in the inside, you may not get there, but you’re in the quarterback’s face, and he can’t see because the pressure’s there. He sees you, and he’s more conscious of you. You’re right there in front of him.”","When watching Donald, Randle notices how his feet, hands and eyes work in concert, with a first step so quick that it can be mistaken for reflex. Donald’s arms allow him to get leverage on taller linemen — plural, considering the double teams he faces — beneath their pads, taking away their strength.","“Some guys at that position are top-heavy with skinny little legs, or are big down below but have nothing up top,” Dewayne Brown, who has helped train Donald since 2009 in their native Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview. “He’s built like a block, totally proportional.”","A secret: Donald may be listed at 285 pounds, but, he said Tuesday, he has been playing at 270, maybe 265. (The Rams’ other defensive tackle, Ndamukong Suh, is listed at 6-4 and 307 pounds.) Over texts, Waufle calls Donald a male model and tells him he’s pretty. Donald’s father, Archie, asked Brown to remind his son that he’s not a bodybuilder. In a photo he posted to his Instagram story Monday, a shirtless Donald is shown flexing, muscles bulging, his abdominal muscles clearly defined. Celery has more fat than he does.","“He’s got, like, an eight-pack,” Rams defensive tackle Michael Brockers said.","In the off-season, Brown helps Donald refine his speed and agility with 45-minute workouts laden with core exercises and resistance training, like the drill he performs wearing lateral resistors on his ankles. As someone drops a tennis ball eight yards away, Donald must sprint to grab it before it bounces a second time. Go on, try it.","To increase his strength, Donald works with Dave Andrews, the strength and conditioning coach at Pitt, who called him “a genetic mutant” and “a ball of dynamite.” Andrews challenges him with exercises in which he provides Donald with resistance throughout the entire movement to isolate a particular muscle group.","“It’s no different than when they’re in hand-to-hand combat on the field, and they’re manually trying to resist what he’s doing,” Andrews said. “Most likely, it takes two, maybe three guys, to slow Aaron down. You can imagine what it’s like in the weight room. Like, good luck. I walk out in a full sweat.”","Donald has long been strong and thick; as an adolescent, he would wake before dawn to lift weights with his father. But Donald was “real chunky,” Brown said, when he first encountered him as a junior at Penn Hills High School.","That season, Greg Gattuso, then the defensive line coach at Pitt, attended a Penn Hills game to scout one of Donald’s teammates. He had heard of Donald but had never watched him. Before leaving, Gattuso offered him a scholarship.","With each successive season at Pitt, Donald had more tackles for loss. His senior year, nearly half of his 59 tackles — 28.5 — came behind the line of scrimmage. At the N.F.L. scouting combine, Donald ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 seconds, faster that year than Raiders quarterback Derek Carr (6-2, 214), Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy (6-3, 243) and Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (6-3, 251). His 10-yard split, which gauges short-area quickness, was a solid 1.65 seconds.","From afar, Waufle yearned. As defensive line coach for the Giants, he replaced interior linemen with speedier ends to overwhelm Brady and unbeaten New England in Super Bowl XLII. He said he studied more game tape of Randle than Randle himself.",Waufle wanted a Randle of his own.,"On draft night, Waufle was working on a project in his office when, around the eighth pick or so, he glanced at the television and noticed Donald was still available. He cycled through scenarios in his head.","He thought Detroit, picking 10th, would grab him. He thought the Giants, picking 12th, would, too. When the Rams were on the clock, he sneaked into the draft room, hoping for good news. When he got it, he nearly yelped inside.","The next time he saw Donald, told him something he had never said to another player: Don’t listen to anything I say.","“We’ll get you lined up, and you just go, man — you just go,” Waufle said, relaying their conversation. “And he did. He tore the league up.”","Waufle left the Rams when McVay was hired, after the 2016 season, but his successor, Bill Johnson, marvels daily at Donald.","“What makes him different is no different than what makes a racehorse so great,” Johnson said. “They’re just sort of made to be, I guess. I don’t know. If I knew, I’d be cloning it.”","Donald’s trajectory might have made teams reassess their evaluations of him. It might have even made them more likely to consider undersized defensive tackles in the future — imitation and flattery, and all that. ","But there is only one Aaron Donald, and to the dismay of every other team, but most of all New England this week, he plays for the Rams."
N.F.L. Will Experiment With Replay Reviews of Pass Interference - The New York Times,"PHOENIX — The N.F.L., in a first, will allow challenges on pass interference next season, whether flags were thrown by referees or not.","The rule change, approved by a 31-1 vote of the league’s owners on Tuesday, came about two months after a controversial non-call on an apparent pass interference play influenced the outcome of the N.F.C. championship game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints.","Many Saints fans, believing that the non-call led to their team’s loss, refused to watch the broadcast of the Super Bowl between the Rams and the New England Patriots.","For one year only, coaches will be able to ask for a video review of possible pass interference plays, whether they have been called on the field or not. Those reviews can come in the first 28 minutes of each half. In the last two minutes of the halves, only replay officials may request a review.","Sean Payton, the Saints coach, said statistics showed that pass interference plays, whether offensive or defensive, were the fouls that had the biggest effect on game.","“We have essentially expanded replay to include two more plays,” he said.",The N.F.L. has never had a review option for possible penalties that did not draw a flag from the officials.,"Rich McKay, the president of the Atlanta Falcons and chairman of the competition committee, said that a league review had shown that of the 50 most impactful calls made incorrectly last season, half had come on defensive pass interference plays. The highest number of penalties that were not called were on offensive pass interference, he said.",McKay said he expected teams to propose that coaches be able to challenge other plays on which penalties are not called.,"“I don’t think we should be scared of replay being expanded,” he said.",N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the change was an attempt to address the furor over the non-call in the Saints-Rams game.,"Allowing challenges and video reviews of more plays will not make officiating perfect, he added. But “don’t let perfect get in the way of better,” Goodell said.","Coaches will still have two challenges per game, and will still get a third if their first two are approved.","Among other rule revisions, the league has now banned all blindside blocks, not just on defenseless players. Those blocks lead to about two-thirds of the injuries on punt returns, McKay said.","Troy Vincent, a former player who is now the league’s executive vice president for football operations, said banning the play would make the game safer.","“The blindside block, it ends careers,” he said. “To have that removed out of our game is significant.”"
Colin Kaepernick and the N.F.L. Settle Collusion Case - The New York Times,"The quarterback Colin Kaepernick ignited impassioned debates over race, activism and free expression after protesting police shootings of black men by kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” at National Football League games in 2016.","The president tweeted his anger at him and dozens of other players who also knelt in protest during the national anthem. Some fans boycotted games over the players’ actions, and some boycotted the N.F.L. with the belief that Mr. Kaepernick, who failed to land a job the next season, was being blacklisted for his leadership in the movement.","Now, two and a half years later, Mr. Kaepernick and a former teammate, Eric Reid, have reached a surprise legal settlement with the N.F.L., which they had accused of colluding to keep them out of the league.","In a terse joint statement issued on Friday afternoon, the league and the players’ lawyers said that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that “there will be no further comment.”","A confidentiality agreement means that, for all the debate and discussion the case generated, it ended with a silence that left hanging whether the league admitted there was any collusion and whether Mr. Kaepernick would ever play another down.","Yet there most likely will be further discussion, as people debate whether Mr. Kaepernick was right and what enduring lesson the owners and league might draw from the saga.","“The most important thing is he started a really important conversation that we’ve been having for a couple of years, and the people who were willing to have that conversation have learned some things,” said Michael MacCambridge, the author of “America’s Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation.”",He added: “I suspect even if Kaepernick knew how long it would take he might have done it differently. But he took a social stand and he was willing to suffer the consequences of that.”,"Mr. Kaepernick, 31, who played for the San Francisco 49ers and took them to the Super Bowl after the 2012 season, has not played in the N.F.L. since the 2016 season, when he began the kneeling campaign. (At first he sat during the anthem, but a former player who is a military veteran suggested he kneel instead to make his point while respecting the American flag.)","He filed a grievance under the league’s collective bargaining agreement in October 2017, months after failing to find a job, and his lawyers have been busy gathering evidence and testimony from numerous N.F.L. owners and league executives.","The case seemed headed to a ruling this spring by an arbitrator, until the abrupt statement on Friday that left the sports world guessing on whether the league paid the players and how much.","After protesting while playing for the 49ers, Mr. Reid, 27, also went unsigned for a period before playing most of last season for the Carolina Panthers. This week he signed a three-year contract with the team.",It is unclear whether Kaepernick will continue trying to play professional football again.,"The settlement of their case was another unpredictable twist in a saga that began in August 2016 when Mr. Kaepernick, an African-American little known as an activist, began his protests during the anthem. He said the gesture was meant to draw attention to racism and police brutality against people of color.","Several players across the league joined him in kneeling during the anthem, generating a national discussion over it and leaving the league flummoxed over how to respond. Last year the N.F.L. instituted a policy that said players could remain in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem, but that if they were on the field they would have to stand.","But that policy was suspended after the N.F.L. Players Association filed a grievance, and it was never enforced.","The sideline protest movement seemed to lose momentum, and few players knelt during this past season. Mr. Kaepernick has said little, reserving most of his comments for his social media accounts. During the Super Bowl this month he posted on his Instagram account pictures of athletes and celebrities wearing jerseys supporting his cause.","On Friday, he only retweeted a statement from his lawyer, Mark Geragos.","Mr. Kaepernick emerged from the protests as both a polarizing figure and a cultural symbol. Last year, Nike signed him to a lucrative endorsement deal even though he remained out of the league and largely silent, not typically what a brand wants from an endorser.","A year before, Nike executives had decided to end their contract with Mr. Kaepernick, before being talked out of it. But with Mr. Kaepernick’s growing stature in the civil rights movement, the apparel company decided to make him a face of its “Just Do It” campaign, debuting a commercial narrated by Mr. Kaepernick during the opening game of the N.F.L. season.","Legal experts have said collusion cases are notoriously difficult to prove, which makes it highly unusual for the league to settle a case like this. It is possible Mr. Kaepernick’s lawyers had gathered enough persuasive evidence and testimony from owners, league officials and football experts that Mr. Kaepernick stood a reasonable chance of persuading the arbitrator hearing the case to rule in his favor.","Frank Hawkins, a former senior vice president of the N.F.L., said he thought the league was probably more worried about embarrassing statements from owners getting out through a hearing than about losing the case.","“People say stupid things, things get taken out of context,” he said. “So I think there was a reasonable potential for embarrassment and it is something that if they could settle it at a reasonable cost, they would probably just think it was worth paying nuisance value.”","Had Mr. Kaepernick won his case in a full hearing, he would have been eligible to receive the money he might have earned if he were signed as a free agent. In addition, he may have received double that amount in punitive damages. In his final year with the 49ers, Mr. Kaepernick earned more than $14 million.","Carl Tobias, an expert on civil litigation who teaches at the University of Richmond School of Law, said that parties settle for all sorts of reasons, even when they believe they may prevail in court. But the N.F.L., he said, most likely wanted to move on from the issue rather than risk an adverse ruling that could, among other things, taint negotiations over the league’s collective bargaining agreement, which will expire in two seasons.","“I think the N.F.L. just wanted to get this behind them and not have this threat hanging over them,” Mr. Tobias said. “I think they’d pay whatever they’d get away with to stop the hemorrhaging and the negative light on the league.”","According to the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the union, the burden is on the player to prove that owners actively conspired against him.","“That is often difficult to do because parties typically don’t leave a written record of their illegal maneuvering,” said William Gould, who was chairman of the National Labor Relations Board at the time of the Major League Baseball strike in 1994.","Mr. Kaepernick, however, received a favorable ruling in August when the arbitrator overseeing the case, Stephen B. Burbank, dismissed the league’s attempt to have the case thrown out, allowing lawyers for Mr. Kaepernick to question owners and league officials in a format similar to a trial.","It was anticipated that Mr. Burbank would rule on the case in the coming months, and as of last week lawyers for Mr. Kaepernick were still preparing for final hearings in front of Mr. Burbank, according to a person with knowledge of the preparations.","Even though Mr. Kaepernick has not played in more than two years, and his play had grown erratic in his last months on the field, his name had continued to surface every time an N.F.L. team signed a new quarterback. Many of these quarterbacks had less experience or statistically did not seem to measure up to him.","Mr. Kaepernick’s name also continued to be invoked at major N.F.L. events, including the Super Bowl this month, when musicians said they would not perform during halftime out of sympathy for his case.","The Associated Press reported this week that a new league, the Alliance of American Football, spoke with Mr. Kaepernick but that he wanted at least $20 million to consider playing in it.","Mr. Kaepernick’s collusion case at times also exposed a bit of a rift between himself and the players’ union. Mr. Kaepernick hired his own lawyers for the case instead of going through the union, and the union’s statement on the resolution said it was informed of the settlement by the N.F.L. and was unaware of the terms."
"Missed Call Dooms Saints, Thrills Rams and Pains New Orleans - The New York Times","NEW ORLEANS — The Saints’ locker room at the Superdome was consumed by silence. Players dressed quickly before departing. A mountain of shoulder pads formed at the center of the room, next to a couple of yellow duffel bags labeled “PLAYOFFS.” Defensive tackle David Onyemata pulled on black jeans with designer rips that revealed skinned knees.","When running back Mark Ingram was asked for his reaction to the moment that had freshly defined the N.F.C. championship on Sunday afternoon, he stared at the floor in front of him and shook his head. When he finally spoke, it came out a whisper.","“I can’t say any words,” he said.","The topic of the day, and one that will probably linger like a noxious cloud over football-crazed New Orleans for years, was a noncall that had helped the Los Angeles Rams secure their Super Bowl berth with a 26-23 overtime victory over the Saints. On a cold day outside, the crowd left the building bubbling with rage. Most of the players tried to exercise at least some restraint.","“Nothing you can do about it now,” wide receiver Tommylee Lewis said.","The play in question happened late in the fourth quarter of a tie game. On third-and-10 at the Rams’ 13, Saints quarterback Drew Brees lofted a pass toward Lewis, who had run a wheel route out of the backfield toward the right sideline. But well before the ball arrived, Lewis was clobbered by cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who had his back to Brees and to the airborne ball — and later acknowledged that, yes, he had probably committed a pass-interference penalty.","“I just know I got there before the ball got there, and I whacked his ass,” Robey-Coleman said.","The only problem: The official closest to the play did not penalize Robey-Coleman for pass interference. It came as a shock to just about everyone, including Robey-Coleman, who recalled hearing the official yell, “Incomplete!” Per league rules, judgment calls like pass interference are not subject to video review.","“I got up and I looked around, and no laundry,” Robey-Coleman said, referring to the absence of a yellow penalty flag.","Had the official thrown one, the Saints would have been awarded a first down, allowing them to run down the clock before attempting a winning field goal (or even scoring a touchdown). The Rams probably never would have gotten the ball back.","Instead, the Saints had to kick a field goal on fourth down that put them ahead by 23-20 with 1 minute 41 seconds to play in regulation. It turned out to be more than enough time for the Rams to march down the field and make a 48-yard field goal that sent the game to overtime. Los Angeles eventually won the game on a 57-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein.","In his postgame news conference, Saints Coach Sean Payton said he had spoken by phone immediately after the game with Alberto Riveron, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president for officiating, and the league office.","“The first thing Al said when I got on the phone: ‘We messed it up,’” Payton said, adding: “It was simple: They blew the call. It should never have not been a call. They said, ‘Not only was it interference, it was helmet to helmet.’ Two calls.”","It was the second straight season that a Saints playoff run ended in heartbreak. Last season, it was a divisional-round loss to the Minnesota Vikings on a 61-yard touchdown reception as time expired — a fluke play that seemed impossible to replicate in terms of soul-crushing consequences.","But then, there was Sunday afternoon.","“That’s tough to swallow,” Brees said. “I think there were plenty of times throughout the season where there’s calls that go against you, go for you, or they miss, or they didn’t. Obviously, in a situation like that where it seemed like everybody in the world saw it, it’s tough.”","Tough, too, because of the Saints’ realistic Super Bowl aspirations. They finished the regular season tied for the best record in the N.F.C., and the Rams were coming to their building, where the crowd tends to be inhospitable to opponents at best — and downright ruthless at worst. The noise was so bad for the Rams on Sunday that quarterback Jared Goff had to put tape over the ear holes of his helmet so he could hear the audio coming from his coach.","Payton, though, has had a contentious relationship with the league, and an errant call — which the N.F.L. admitted making — in such a crucial moment seems sure to add to an already robust sense of injustice in New Orleans.","Much of that agita stems from the so-called Bountygate scandal, in which the Saints coaching staff was found to have rewarded players who injured opponents. As a part of the fallout, Payton was barred by the league from coaching during the 2012 season, and some of the scars are still evident, all these years later.","On Sunday, defensive end Cameron Jordan suggested that the referees were biased against the Saints.","“We know for a long time that we don’t get calls that way,” Jordan said, adding: “As far as I’ve known, we haven’t had referees that go gung-ho for the Saints. We’ve got to put ourselves in the best position so we’re not able to be touched.",“Will it haunt that ref? Who cares. Will it haunt this team? This will be something that will be another defining moment for us.”,"As for Robey-Coleman, the Rams cornerback who made the hit, he appeared to sense his place in football lore almost immediately.","“They’re going to show that forever,” he said, referring to the clip of the play. “They’re going to show that forever. New Orleans is going to hate me.”",He did not sound very sad about it.
Robert Kraft Wouldn’t Talk to Us. Here’s How We Profiled Him. - The New York Times,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.",Sometimes not knowing much about a person or a topic can make a reporter ideal for a story assignment. ,The panic of jumping into a world you know nothing about will usually cause you to do a ton of research and reporting. ,"And you don’t know better than to try really hard to land interviews with people who don’t often give them, like New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.","But it gets pretty complicated when you find yourself writing a profile on someone you’ve never met, whom you cannot interview, who has been intensely followed and written about for more than two decades and who is now at the center of a media firestorm.","That’s the challenge I faced when my editor on the Styles desk asked me to write a profile of Robert K. Kraft, the multibillionaire owner of the New England Patriots. Mr. Kraft was charged a month ago with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution in Jupiter, Fla. ","My task was to find out why a guy who is, as I ended up putting it, “a billionaire six times over and an N.F.L. team owner practically running out of fingers for Super Bowl rings” visited a strip-mall massage parlor 30 minutes from his Palm Beach home.","Mr. Kraft’s wife of 48 years, Myra, had died from cancer in 2011. I thought this was an important piece of information to understand his life today: awash in billionaire, N.F.L.-owning privilege, but lonesome and impacted by grief.","To get started, I asked Ken Belson, who covers the N.F.L. for The Times, if he would team up with me to work on the piece. He was busy reporting on the efforts to resolve the matter before the N.F.L. owners’ annual meeting began in Phoenix last weekend. But he spent hours giving me an education in the politics, hierarchies and dramas that exist behind the scenes in the N.F.L.","Then I started contacting everyone I could think of: Mr. Kraft’s lawyers and communications reps, obviously, but also anyone I have seen him linked to in press stories — Michael Rubin, an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers; the rapper Meek Mill; officials at Columbia University, to which Mr. Kraft has given tens of millions; Larry King, who I heard was at least a casual friend of Mr. Kraft’s; and Mr. Kraft’s on-and-off girlfriend Ricki Lander.","That’s a short list, and not everyone called me back. But to those who did, I made a simple pitch. I wanted to tell Mr. Kraft’s story to people like me, who didn’t know much about him beyond tabloid headlines and gossip columns. ","I think his friends probably decided that a feature piece written by a woman who is not a football fan could help humanize him. I landed on-the-record interviews with the current and former Patriots quarterbacks Tom Brady and Drew Bledsoe, the musicians Meek Mill and Kenny Chesney, Mr. Rubin, Mr. King and others.","Getting Mr. Brady to call me from his family ski vacation, rather than merely accepting the offer of an email interview, took a lot of pushing and cajoling. I explained to various public relations representatives that I would write in the story that Mr. Brady submitted comments over email through a Patriots spokesman, which doesn’t convey the same level of support of Mr. Kraft as getting on the phone for an actual interview. As Patriots coach Bill Belichick has said, “You get the job done or you don’t.” I did.","Access brings its own concerns. Mr. Kraft’s friends were painting a wholly sympathetic portrait, as you would expect. But I couldn’t publish a story that sanctified Mr. Kraft and ignored the fact that he needed good P.R. to avoid damaging his most cherished and valuable asset, the Patriots. Nor could I ignore the perils of the sex trade, even if his friends made a good argument that Mr. Kraft’s case was being overly amplified by Florida prosecutors. ","So I stopped asking Ken Belson to join forces with me, and started begging.",Now he and Mr. Brady both know how persuasive my nagging can be. ,"Together, Ken and I aimed to deliver a newsy story that humanizes a famous man without ignoring any of the reasons that he is in the spotlight.",We published the piece online Friday afternoon. Then Ken and I experienced a phenomenon that is particular to this time in history. Our story got trumped.,News that the special counsel Robert Mueller’s long awaited report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was delivered to the Department of Justice right around the time we published.,That’s a tough news cycle in which to compete. But we left it all on the field.
Hidden Gems: Do the Patriots Find Them or Create Them? - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — In 2000, Antowain Smith, a running back who had been the Buffalo Bills’ first-round draft pick three years earlier, was unceremoniously cut by the team. Smith had been buried on the Bills’ bench.","The next season, Smith landed in the training camp of the New England Patriots, even though some of his friends wondered why he wanted to play for a team coming off a 5-11 season and for a head coach, Bill Belichick, who seemed on his way to getting fired by a second N.F.L. team.","The Patriots already had two, young homegrown running backs, so what kind of chance would they give a veteran discarded by the second-rate Bills?","Smith became the first conspicuous castoff to end up playing a prominent role in a Patriots championship. In New England’s first Super Bowl victory in 2002, it was Smith — not the St. Louis Rams star Marshall Faulk — who became the game’s leading rusher, with 92 yards.","“I turned out to be the perfect fit that they needed,” Smith recalled in a telephone interview Thursday. “Belichick told me when I got there: ‘Do what you’re told and you’ll have a role.’ He spoke the truth.”",Such surprises have become a staple of the Belichick era: The Patriots win a Super Bowl when someone they found languishing on the waiver wire — or ignored until the bottom of the draft — ends up taking a star turn on pro football’s biggest stage.,"It does not happen by accident, former Patriots say.","“There were always younger guys that maybe got overlooked because there was a piece of their game that hadn’t been fully realized, but Bill sees the potential,” said Matt Light, a former Patriots offensive tackle. Light was not one of the lesser-known players, but he saw many of them suddenly appear in the locker room.","“Bill can wait on them, and then he can insert them into roles clearly defined,” Light continued. “Their role is always very well communicated, and they can go out and experience some success. And it’s amazing what success will do for a guy off the street.”",[How beloved is Tom Brady in New England?],"Smith wasn’t the only unexpected hero of the 2002 Super Bowl. David Patten, a former Arena Football League player who spent four mostly mediocre seasons with two other N.F.L. teams before joining New England, scored the team’s only offensive touchdown in the game when he faked and slipped behind a defender for an 8-yard reception in the end zone that put the Patriots ahead by 11 points.","Patten made 165 catches for the Patriots over four seasons, and 15 more in the playoffs.","Fast forward to the next Patriots Super Bowl victory, in 2004. Wide receiver David Givens was not a reject from another N.F.L. team; he came to the Patriots as the 253rd overall pick of the 2002 draft, taken in the seventh round. He played very little in his first two seasons, catching just 43 passes. But in the 2004 Super Bowl against the Carolina Panthers, Givens emerged from the shadows to make a 5-yard touchdown reception that gave New England a 14-7 lead just before halftime.","Givens had five catches for 69 yards in the game, none more important than an 18-yard reception on third-and-9 that put his team 3 yards from the end zone. It set up the Patriots’ final touchdown, with less than three minutes left.","The litany of Patriots who were shrewdly lured from other teams and then became Super Bowl heroes includes Corey Dillon, who was one of the best running backs in the N.F.L. for six years, until his production for the Cincinnati Bengals dropped precipitously in 2003.","Dillon’s career seemed in jeopardy as he approached his 30th birthday, and then the Patriots traded for him before the 2004 season. Dillon had the best season of his career and led all rushers in the 2005 Super Bowl. He scored a touchdown and ran for 9 key yards in the Patriots’ final scoring drive in a 24-21 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.","In 2015, the surprise performer was Malcolm Butler, an undrafted, reserve rookie cornerback whose goal-line interception averted certain defeat against the Seattle Seahawks.","Two seasons later, Belichick would use his background as a college lacrosse player to recruit an unlikely big-moment star. Chris Hogan, who played lacrosse at Penn State, reinvented himself as a wide receiver, playing four years for the Buffalo Bills, but they made no attempt to match the Patriots’ free-agent contract offer to Hogan before the 2016 season.","In the Super Bowl that season, Hogan made a pivotal, 16-yard, third-down catch that led to the tying touchdown against Atlanta late in the fourth quarter. Then in overtime, Hogan had an 18-yard reception that helped vault New England to its fifth Super Bowl victory.","“I think the Patriots have shown an ability to see guys for what they can ultimately be, and then they tailor the coaching to see if they can make it happen,” Hogan said here in Atlanta on Thursday. “The idea is to make you better at what you already do well.”","Matt Chatham, who played linebacker on three Patriots championship teams from 2002 to 2005, came to New England after he was cut by St. Louis in his rookie year. He had a slightly different take on how the Patriots continually find and polish diamonds in the rough.","“They’re not going to put you out in some sort of uncomfortable situation where athletically you wouldn’t be able to do it,” Chatham said. “That said, they may find the things that you do better than anyone else that another scheme doesn’t highlight.”","Chatham added, “Then they find a role that fits that.”","Smith, who got in nearly on the ground floor of the Belichick regime, said he thought it came down to Belichick’s renowned fastidiousness and punitive nature.","“People call Belichick a defensive coach, but if you think he’s not paying attention to everything the offense and special teams are doing, then just try making a mistake in practice on one of those plays,” Smith said. “You’ll be in his doghouse real quick. And he’ll tell you that you’re in the doghouse and then he’ll let you sit on the bench and think about it for a while.","“When you get another chance, or your only other chance, it doesn’t matter who you are, you’re ready to make something of it.”"
He Traded His Yellow Flag for a Microphone. Another Super Bowl Awaits. - The New York Times,"ATLANTA — Gene Steratore is back at the Super Bowl, one year after he ruled on two crucial, razor-close touchdown catches.","This time, his view will be from the broadcast booth, not the field. He was hired by CBS in June to be a rules analyst for its N.F.L. and college basketball telecasts.","At 55, Steratore is young enough — and fit enough — to be a referee for several more years. But after reaching the top of that profession, he is relishing doing something new, and, in some ways even more high-profile than serving as chief cop on the biggest stage in American sports. He now explains the intricacies of the rule book to tens of millions of sports fans watching on television.","“The excitement of the unknown, becoming a neophyte again, at a very high level, was extremely challenging to me,” Steratore said.","Steratore has made some of the most scrutinized — and denigrated — N.F.L. calls of the last decade. He overturned a potential winning touchdown catch by Detroit’s Calvin Johnson and a Dez Bryant catch for Dallas in the playoffs four years ago. Then last February, he upheld disputed touchdown grabs made by Philadelphia’s Corey Clement and Zach Ertz.","“Calvin Johnson didn’t catch it. Dez Bryant didn’t catch it. Corey Clement and Zach Ertz did catch it. O.K., it’s time to quit. That’s it. I’m out of here,” Steratore said while laughing during an interview days ahead of Super Bowl LIII.",[Read about sticky gloves and amazing catches.],"When Steratore started wearing zebra stripes, his current job did not exist. In 2010, Fox became the first network to hire an N.F.L. rules analyst: Mike Pereira, formerly the league’s director of officiating. CBS, NBC and ESPN have followed suit. Steratore is teamed with Jim Nantz, a veteran broadcaster, and Tony Romo, a wunderkind play predictor. But if the Super Bowl is anything like the conference championship games, Steratore will be the member of the broadcast team sitting under the brightest spotlight.","In the N.F.C. title game, shown on Fox, the officials failed to call an obvious penalty on Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman late in the fourth quarter after he hit New Orleans Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis before the ball arrived. The Saints went on to kick a field goal, but the Rams tied the game and eventually won it in overtime.","The noncall has dominated football chatter for the past two weeks. As a result, N.F.L. rules and their interpretation are top of mind.","Steratore, calling the A.F.C. Championship, had his own mess, err, messes, to deal with. After barely speaking for the first three quarters, Steratore was asked to comment on six fourth-quarter plays, including one that produced a questionable roughing-the-passer penalty against Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones.","He defended Clete Blakeman, the referee who made the call, and then stated plainly that Blakeman got it wrong. “It’s a swing and a miss, and it’s a missed call for roughing the passer there,” Steratore said on the telecast.",[Read what happens when players and officials chat on the field.],"Steratore, one of seven brothers and sisters, comes from a family of referees. His older brother, Tony, is an N.F.L. official, and his younger brother, Michael, referees lower-division college basketball. His father, also named Gene, was a college football and basketball official, and a cousin, Frank, just officiated the college football national championship game.","He is almost as close with his refereeing comrades. The head of the crew that botched the Robey-Coleman noncall, Bill Vinovich, was, with Steratore, one of the two active N.F.L. referees officiating Division I college basketball games.","“Vinny and I have a special relationship,” Steratore said.","He has said repeatedly this week that Vinovich’s crew got the call wrong, but also defended Vinovich, who told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play.","Steratore explained that Vinovich’s specific responsibility on the play was to watch the offensive line and the quarterback, not a pass 15 yards down the field.","“If you turn your head when that ball leaves and that quarterback gets hit at his knee or below and he’s laying there out, and there is no flag, it is a much more egregious mistake than this one,” Steratore said.","Gerald Austin, a former referee and ESPN rules analyst for six seasons, said parts of the analyst job were harder than being a referee.","There are seven officials on the field, each covering a specific area, but a rules analyst must cover it all. While analysts are watching the ball, there could be a development across the field they are asked to comment on a few seconds later, with limited time to watch a replay.","“Your decision has to be quicker and more on target in a shorter period of time,” Austin said.","Steratore said his job also involved educating viewers about the process of ruling on difficult calls. He quickly explains the situation and generally what the officials are considering, and then, after a few replays, he goes over the specific things they are looking at to make a call.",Only after he has seen every relevant angle does he say what the call should be.,"“The greatest officials in the world, they’re in the N.F.L.,” Steratore said. “It is fun to hate them, and it’s part of our game and we’re cool with that. We still need to have someone explaining to the world that these people are that good at what they do, even with their mistakes.”","Steratore grew up in Uniontown, Pa., and now lives in Washington, Pa., both about an hour outside of Pittsburgh. He officiated 11 Steelers game in his career, including two against their division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens. Brian Billick, the former Ravens coach, would tell Steratore he wanted him to referee every one of those games.","“His reverse psychology was that if it was a 50/50 play, I might be more inclined to go his way for fear of what the public may think,” Steratore said.","Billick said his request was mostly tongue in cheek, though he thought it was “worth bringing up just to get him to think about it — maybe he’ll pause.”","The referee for the Super Bowl will be John Parry, who was promoted to his job in 2007 after Vinovich temporarily retired because of health problems. Steratore knows Parry well, of course. His brother Tony officiated a previous Super Bowl alongside Parry, and Parry’s late father, David, was the supervisor of officials for the Big Ten.","Steratore said he expected Parry to do a great job. But if he doesn’t, or when he inevitably has to deal with an incredibly tight play, Steratore will be ready."
What Will the N.F.L. Do About Robert Kraft This Time? - The New York Times,"Roger Goodell began his tenure as commissioner of the N.F.L. in 2006 declaring that disciplining the league’s 2,000 players for their transgressions would be a priority. True to his word, the number of suspensions and fines rose, and it remains high relative to what it was.","Disciplining owners, though, has been more complicated. As with players, the N.F.L. constitution gives the league commissioner broad authority to penalize owners for “conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football.”","But while the players essentially work for Goodell, and have little leverage to influence his decisions, Goodell works for the owners, and those owners include Robert K. Kraft of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.","Kraft, 77, was charged on Friday with two counts of soliciting sex as part of a wide-ranging investigation into prostitution and human trafficking in Florida. The police in Jupiter, Fla., used video surveillance that showed Kraft inside a massage parlor that, the police said, was used for selling sex.","In a statement, the Patriots “categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.”","However the case is resolved, the episode is an embarrassment to a league that likes to portray itself as a pillar of moral rectitude but that has struggled to shake an image that its players, employees and owners treat women poorly.","The league has been rocked by a host of domestic violence scandals. Cheerleaders have detailed how they were exploited by their teams. Last year, Jerry Richardson, the former owner of the Carolina Panthers, was fined $2.75 million after an investigation confirmed claims that for years he sexually harassed employees.",Now this.,"If Kraft is found to have committed a crime, even a misdemeanor, Goodell will be under pressure to penalize him to compensate for the embarrassment the league has suffered. How he treats the matter will provide an illustration of the dynamics of power at the highest ranks of the league and show the lengths he will go to appear to treat players and owners equally before the expiration of the current labor deal two years from now.","Kraft may be the league’s most successful owner: His franchise has won six Super Bowl titles since the 2001 season. As a key figure in negotiating labor deals and broadcast contracts, he may also be the league’s most powerful one. He is also a confidant of the commissioner, close with the leaders of the league’s media partners and the league’s go-between with President Trump.","That said, the N.F.L. includes its share of misfits and wayward sons, and from time to time, the patriarch, or, in this case, the commissioner, has to dole out justice. How much justice often depends on the stature of the owner, the offense he or she committed and any past transgressions.","Some cases are straightforward. When Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty for failing to report a felony arising from a gambling fraud and extortion case, few were surprised when the commissioner at the time, Paul Tagliabue, fined him $1 million and suspended him for the 1999 season.","Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, who has a history of substance abuse, pleaded guilty to driving while impaired, and was promptly suspended for six games and fined $500,000 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.","Kraft’s case is more complicated. He was charged with two misdemeanors, and those charges may be reduced or dropped as charges of soliciting a prostitute often are. Kraft is not married. His wife, Myra, died of cancer in 2011.","Hugh Culverhouse Jr., who was involved in league matters when his father owned the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and who practiced federal criminal law for 30 years, said Goodell would most likely wait to see if the charges against Kraft were dropped, and then might only issue a fine.","Even so, he suggested Kraft was likely to be treated with kid gloves because he is among the most powerful owners. Kraft also sits on the compensation committee, which determines the size of Goodell’s paycheck.","“He essentially could be sanctioned for bad taste,” Culverhouse said. “It will come down to embarrassment.”","In a statement, the N.F.L. said it is “aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.”","At the very least, the commissioner will have to appear not to have one set of rules for players and another for owners. There are differences, though. Player penalties are negotiated by the players’ union and the league and included in the collective bargaining agreement.","The league’s constitution says Goodell can suspend or fine an owner (for no more than $500,000), or both. A suspended owner cannot go to the team’s training facility or stadium.","If warranted, the commissioner can refer the matter to the entire group of owners, which can vote to impose additional penalties.","That is unlikely to happen in Kraft’s case. Jodi Balsam, who was a lawyer at the N.F.L. and now teaches at Brooklyn Law School, said the league often waits until legal cases are resolved before penalties are assessed. Prostitution cases are often adjudicated quickly, she said, though this case will receive more scrutiny because it is part of a human trafficking investigation.","“If he is convicted, that would seem to bolster the case for commissioner discipline,” she said. And “even if he escapes criminal penalty, the league can conduct its own investigation and decide to penalize him.”","Goodell and the Patriots have butted heads before, over Spygate, in which the Patriots were found to be filming their opponents’ sideline to steal signals, and Deflategate, in which a league investigation determined it was most likely that the team had deliberately deflated footballs in inclement weather so players could grip the ball better.","Kraft didn’t hide his anger about the penalties his organization received in those cases. This one, of course, is different."

Was C.T.E. Stealing His Mind? A Gunshot Provided the Answer - The New York Times,"DIXON, Calif. — The blast from upstairs shattered the quiet of a small-town weeknight. It was all so sudden. Or had it been coming for years?","Jason Hairston had just been downstairs with his young son and daughter, who could not understand why their father was acting so strange. His wife, on the phone from across the country, was desperately trying to get her husband to say something, anything.","He ended the call without a word, walked upstairs and closed the bedroom door. He lay down on his wife’s side of the bed, lifted a gun under his chin and pulled the trigger.","The son, Cash, was 10, old enough to have previously Googled “C.T.E.”, wise enough to know what had just happened, poised enough to block his 9-year-old sister, Coco, from instinctively running upstairs toward the sound. He pulled her outside. The police and family members were on the way.","If there is such a thing as the American dream, Hairston, at 47, gave every indication that he was living it. He was a former college football star who played briefly with two N.F.L. teams, and he was the founder of KUIU, a top-end outfitter of hunting gear and apparel. He had legions of faithful customers and good friends who aspired to be like him.",He traveled to the most remote and rugged edges of the earth in search of quiet adventures and big game. He had just returned from a caribou hunting trip in Alaska with his father and son. And he had been sheep hunting with Donald Trump Jr. in the Yukon a couple of weeks before.,"He had recently described his wife and business partner, Kirstyn, during a 20th anniversary dinner toast as “truly my rock, my soul mate, the most loyal wife you could ever have.”","They had family photos that looked like the kind that come with the frame. They lived in a grandly renovated home just a block and a half from where Kirstyn’s family ran the city of Dixon’s favorite gathering spot, Bud’s Pub and Grill, at the corner of First and A Street. It was two miles from the headquarters of KUIU, which has been heralded as a runaway business success.","Hairston had it all, or so it seemed. Then the gun went off. And the questions echoed long after everything went quiet on that Tuesday evening in September.","The case of Jason Hairston is unusual for at least two reasons. First, he was convinced, years ago, that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the progressive degenerative brain disease caused by repeated hits to the head. It can be diagnosed with certainty only in the dead, but he and Kirstyn, now 46, intensely studied the research. They saw a clear picture of Hairston in all the data points and accounts of deteriorating brains, especially in football players.","Second, Hairston defied the image of a diminished victim of C.T.E. He was in near-perfect physical health, with 3 percent body fat and model-handsome looks. Confident and charismatic to the end, his public persona contradicted the corruption he felt in his brain.","“He was very open about it, but I just didn’t see it,” Brendan Burns, Hairston’s closest hunting partner and a KUIU executive (now co-chief executive), said shortly after Hairston’s death. “I was like: ‘Dude, I think you’re overthinking this. You’re paranoid.’ Because what you read about is the guy who can’t get out his front door. He was so sharp. Maybe that’s why I didn’t think much about it. It was conceptual. It wasn’t like we were on a sheep hunt and he’s trying to skin a sheep with a spoon.”","Hairston was a linebacker in high school and at the University of California, Davis, not far from Dixon. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in May 1995, and spent part of the season on the team’s practice squad. The Denver Broncos signed Hairston the next May, but he left the game for good a month later with numbness from a lingering neck injury in college.","An avid hunter, he saw an open niche in high-end hunting apparel, a market overlooked by the likes of the North Face or Patagonia. Hairston co-founded Sitka Gear in 2005, and after a management shuffle, he moved on to start KUIU, a direct-to-consumer company, in 2011.","Hairston became KUIU’s public face, an aspirational figure. Photos and videos of him hunting sheep, moose, bear and other big game were featured in the company’s savvy social media marketing and glossy catalogs. Forbes reported that KUIU did $50 million in sales in 2016.","I spent time with Hairston in Dixon in 2016 while exploring story ideas. (It eventually led to an article in 2017 titled, “The Ultimate Pursuit in Hunting: Sheep”; Hairston and Burns played roles.) Hairston was focused and engaging, which made it a surprise when he mentioned that he thought he had C.T.E.","He had a history of concussions, he said, too many to remember. He was fighting headaches, mood swings, impulsivity — all symptoms of C.T.E., which shares characteristics with Alzheimer's disease.","Knowing that I had written many accounts of C.T.E., including one shortly before we met, about the former Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, he and Kirstyn were inquisitive.","They used their full range of contacts and money on doctors, tests, medications and advice, all in hopes of slowing the effects. Hairston tried diets and hyperbaric chambers. The more he felt his mind slip, the more he exercised his body. The more he worried about time, the more things he crammed into whatever time he had left.","In November 2017, Hairston emailed me a photograph of him and his son with Goliath, an aging and elusive desert bighorn sheep they hunted on a tag purchased at auction for $235,000. That bid was a part of the article published months earlier.","“He is the new CA State Record Ram, 12 years old and as big as everyone who hunted him previously thought he was,” Hairston wrote. “Enclosed are photos of my Cash and I. It was such an amazing experience to share with my son.”","Less than a year later, his suicide shocked family and friends, admiring strangers and loyal customers. It did not surprise Kirstyn, who had watched the decline close up.","“We were really good at hiding it,” she said.",The couple’s suspicions were right. Hairston had C.T.E.,"Bennet Omalu, a clinical professor at  U.C. Davis, made the diagnosis at his lab in Stockton. The results, part of a 44-page autopsy, had not previously been revealed publicly.","“He has C.T.E., there is no question about it,” Omalu said in an interview, describing the buildup of abnormal and cell-strangling tau proteins he found across most regions of Hairston’s brain. “Those are the telltale signs, undeniably. This was almost a replica of Mike Webster’s brain.”","Omalu discovered the disease in Webster, a Hall of Fame lineman who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and who died in 2002 at age 50. That diagnosis connected C.T.E. to football in the national consciousness, and garnered Omalu a measure of fame. He was played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie “Concussion.”","A malady formerly attached to “punch drunk” boxers, C.T.E. has now been found posthumously in more than 200 former football players, including more than 100 who played in the N.F.L., plus an array of athletes in sports ranging from hockey to soccer, rodeo to BMX. Much of the research about the condition has centered on brain injuries in the military.","Scientists are on the verge of being able to confidently diagnose C.T.E. in the living. It promises to be a game-changer, leading to all sorts of complex ethical questions in sports.","When a football star receives a C.T.E. diagnosis, for example, who will decide whether he should stop playing? Will high schools, colleges and professional teams have an obligation to test and reveal the results? Will athletes in all sports, at all ages, have the option to be tested?","Hairston embodied some of that coming anxiety. During news media interviews in recent years, he sometimes mentioned offhandedly that he thought he had C.T.E. The conversations always moved on quickly.","Even those who hunted with him regularly said they did not see cause for concern. Paul Bride, an outdoors photographer who worked for KUIU, accompanied Hairston on all his expeditions.","“I saw him on his best days, in the best place he could be — the mountains,” Bride said.","In hindsight, though, his friends said maybe Hairston had become more forgetful, a bit less predictable. None of those close to him were alarmed enough to worry that he might end his life. He had it all.","Privately, though, the Hairstons struggled to hold it together. Jason Hairston routinely broke down and cried, Kirstyn said, scared of where his brain was headed. When a scan revealed deterioration in the frontal lobe that had not been present a year earlier, she said, Hairston made her promise she would never make him have another test, because he did not want to know the results.","A slow decline over the past decade, she said, sped suddenly into a drop.","“The last 18 months, he wasn’t there,” she said, sitting in the living room of the family home. “It was like a switch flipped. He was so different. We were going from one crisis to another. I felt like I was drowning.”","Impulsivity spiked through flashes of infidelity and alcohol abuse. (He had been in alcohol rehabilitation about 10 years earlier, Kirstyn Hairston said.) Hairston showed unfamiliar anger — toward the children, the family pets, other drivers on the road. He sometimes fell to his knees with headaches, complaining of ice picks to his brain. He dropped into dark periods of depression, his wife said, tinged with fear of being alone. ","“I knew it was C.T.E.,” Kirstyn said. “I read everything I could. This was such typical behavior for C.T.E.”",She cried as she delved into details.,"“He said, ‘If you leave me, I’ll be dead in three months,’” she said. “And I said, ‘You’ll be dead in a week.’ But I needed him for the kids. And I know he would have stayed for me.”","The two were apart for most of Hairston’s last month. He went on two hunts. Kirstyn was invited to New York with friends, a rare time away. They crossed paths at the Sacramento airport. He was on his way home. She was on her way out. He took the children. ","“He said: ‘You think I can’t take care of our kids for three nights? I’m good,’” Kirstyn said. “I said, ‘O.K.’ You always want it to work out.”","They shared a long embrace, then spoke on the phone the next evening, discussing KUIU. (Kirstyn worked alongside her husband and remains the chairwoman and majority owner.) Jason ordered pizza for the children. The couple laughed at the role reversal, she said. Usually she was the one at home with them.","She was at dinner in New York two hours later when her son called, saying that Jason was behaving oddly. She asked to talk to him. Her husband held the phone to his ear but said nothing. He hung up.","Kirstyn Hairston called her parents, who lived a few blocks away, to ask them to rush to the house.","When she called her son again, the gun had already gone off.","The autopsy found a blood-alcohol level of 0.22 percent, two to three times the typical limit for drunken driving. His system also contained sertraline and trazodone, prescription medications commonly used to combat depression and anxiety.",Kirstyn Hairston had a feeling the day would come. But not so soon.,"“I thought I had another five years,” she said through tears. “I really did.”","But she believed that if Hairston ever took his life, he would shoot himself in the chest to preserve his brain for examination, as Dave Duerson did in 2011 (at age 50) and as Junior Seau did in 2013 (at 43). Both posthumously received diagnoses of C.T.E. ","Still, Omalu said there was plenty of Hairston’s brain tissue to study. The answer he provided — the positive diagnosis of the C.T.E. that the Hairstons long presumed — brought some measure of relief.","“I’m not surprised Jason killed himself,” Kirstyn Hairston said. “I’m surprised he did it with our kids in the house. I’m surprised he did it here. But would you want to live if you knew you were losing your mind? Especially being really young and really healthy?”","She let the questions linger, unanswered. The house went quiet.","If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources."
Letting Landon Collins Leave Continues a Disturbing Trend for the Giants - The New York Times,The Giants on Tuesday allowed the three-time Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins to enter free agency rather than use an $11.15 million franchise tag that would have kept him a Giant.,"It was startling decision because Collins, 25, was one of the few stars on a porous defense that even the Giants’ brain trust blamed for a dispiriting 5-11 record last season.",But more alarming is that Collins’s departure continues a discouraging trend in recent Giants history: the procession of top draft picks discarded by the team.,"Collins was a second-round selection in 2015. The Giants traded three picks (in the second, fourth and seventh rounds) to move up so they could take Collins with the first choice of the second round.","Now Collins, in the early part of his prime, is unencumbered in free agency, where he will draw considerable interest. It’s a familiar fate for a Giants draft pick.","In 10 drafts from 2008 to 2017, the Giants selected 70 players. Only seven are still with the team.","The player the Giants chose in the first round ahead of Collins in 2015, tackle Ereck Flowers, was a colossal bust and was cut from the team early last season. In fact, no other player from the Giants 2015 draft class is still on the roster.","That is hardly an aberration. The only player left from the 2014 draft class is Odell Beckham Jr. No player selected in 2013 is still with the team, and only two from 2016 are in a Giants uniform.","The Giants’ approach to team building — if that’s even an appropriate term since they have had just one winning season since 2012 — has been highly unconventional as compared with their peers. In an era of salary cap restrictions, most N.F.L. teams have treated their draft selections like prized jewels to be coveted as they molded rosters with carefully chosen picks from the amateur draft.","Collins certainly appeared to be the one selection of the Giants’ 2015 draft who would make the team proud for many seasons. After an uneven rookie season, a typical outcome for a first-year defensive back, Collins had five interceptions and 100 solo tackles in his second season, resulting in his being named to the All-Pro team.","Collins’s production slumped slightly in the next season when he was not 100 percent because of injury. The same was true in 2018, but Collins still made the Pro Bowl in each of the last two seasons. He led the team in tackles in each of his four seasons.","Collins also grew into a respected team leader who was a dependable, stand-up presence in an often fractious locker room that endured two coaching changes and consistent losing.","It is true that Collins’s strengths as a player are as a run stopper, and last season his lack of downfield coverage skills were occasionally laid bare by opponents. Every year, the N.F.L. becomes more of a pass-first league, and it’s possible that the Giants will seem prescient for not investing heavily in a safety who might not be as valuable in a few years when teams are throwing the football 70 percent of the time — or more often.","And then, of course, there is considerable salary that Collins would have commanded under the Giants’ franchise tag. More than $11 million is a lot for a safety. But the Giants could have negotiated a long-term contract with Collins to mitigate the annual cost.","Meanwhile, it’s hard to forget that Eli Manning, who is 38 and has won eight games as the Giants’ starting quarterback in the last two seasons, will count $23.2 million against the Giants’ salary cap in 2019.","The overarching strategy of Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman, who has been charged with fixing most of the draft choice blunders made by his predecessor, Jerry Reese, is not clear. Gettleman may be counting on the Giants receiving a high-round compensatory draft pick when Collins signs with another team. In addition, Gettleman may have feared that Collins, if designated with the franchise tag, would stay away from the team throughout training camp this summer, a negotiating tactic employed in recent years by other players seeking long-term deals. The Giants may not have wanted that distraction.","What is known is that a poor Giants defense just got substantially worse. The Giants will now have more money to pursue free agents to resolve that expanding deficiency. And, bucking a trend, they had better draft wisely."
Joe Flacco Is Reportedly Headed to the Broncos. But Mum Is the Word. - The New York Times,"On Wednesday afternoon, the lead story on DenverBroncos.com was about Joe Flacco. So were the website’s top three featured videos. The team also posted about Flacco on Twitter and Facebook.","All of that happened while Flacco, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback, was still officially a member of the Baltimore Ravens.","In the Broncos’ latest attempt to solve their quarterback problems, they are expected to trade for Flacco, but the N.F.L. calendar does not allow the deal to be completed until March. That leaves the team in the awkward position of trying to acknowledge the move without stating that it happened.","Provided the deal, first reported by ESPN, does not fall apart, the Broncos will presumably be replacing Case Keenum, the incumbent starter at quarterback.","Flacco, 34, got off to a 4-5 start last season with Baltimore before missing some time with an injury, then lost his job because of a remarkable performance by his substitute, Lamar Jackson, whom the Ravens had chosen in the first round of the 2018 draft.","Flacco, a first-round pick by the Ravens in 2008, had started 157 of Baltimore’s 163 games leading up to the hip injury that effectively ended his time with the team. His tenure included five 10-win seasons and reached its peak in 2011, when he led a thrilling run through the playoffs that culminated in a win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII.","The Broncos, who signed Keenum as a free agent last off-season, finished 6-10 in 2018, the third consecutive year in which they failed to make the playoffs.","Despite having John Elway, a Hall of Fame quarterback who won two Super Bowls with the Broncos, running the team’s football operations, Denver has struggled considerably at the position in recent years.","Peyton Manning was a shell of himself as the Broncos’ quarterback in 2015, but the defense and running game did enough to dominate the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. A parade of quarterbacks since — Trevor Siemian, Paxton Lynch, Brock Osweiler and Keenum have all started games — have failed to live up to that standard, combining to go 20-28.","Now the Broncos appear to be turning to Flacco, who has no guaranteed money left in his contract but has base salaries over the next three years of $18.5 million, $20.25 million and $24.25 million","The notion that Flacco is an upgrade from Keenum is debatable. In his lone season with Denver, Keenum, 30, completed 62.3 percent of his passes, with 18 touchdowns, 15 interceptions and an adjusted-yards-per-pass figure of 6.1. Those numbers were well below what he had produced as a fill-in starter for Minnesota in the previous season. But the numbers make him, at the very least, competitive with Flacco, who is more than three years older and had 12 touchdowns, six interceptions and 6.4 adjusted yards per pass.","Keenum, who is guaranteed $7 million of his $18 million salary next season, will presumably be shopped to other teams.","The move, while somewhat questionable for Denver, makes sense for Baltimore. The team was in a tailspin when Flacco was injured, and it appeared that Coach John Harbaugh’s job was in jeopardy.","After Jackson stepped in, the offense was reborn as a run-first attack unlike anything the league had seen in decades. Jackson went 6-1 as a starter, and while his passing clearly needed work, he ran for 695 yards, or 4.7 yards a carry.","Despite a devastating wild-card round loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, the Ravens were presumably already committed to Jackson as their starter. The Broncos are expected to send the Ravens a fourth-round draft pick, giving Baltimore a decent return on a player who had gone just 24-27 over the last four seasons."
Saints Beat Patriots in “Super Bowl LIII.” - The New York Times,"If you sat through Sunday’s football-related entertainment, you could be forgiven for swearing off Super Bowls forever.",That might be too precipitous. Quite a few recent games have been thrillers with lots of touchdowns and exciting moments.,"Just last year the Philadelphia Eagles won their first championship in half a century in a 74-point classic. The year before the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons battled into overtime. In the last 10 years, we have had Patriots 28-Seattle Seahawks 24, Baltimore Ravens 34-San Francisco 49ers 31 and Giants 21-Patriots 17.","Sunday was more of a throwback to the late 1980s and early ’90s, when the Denver Broncos or the Buffalo Bills were getting demolished year after year and Super Bowls let the public down as frequently as Star Wars prequels.",And come on now. Was Sunday’s game even really all that bad?,Yes. Yes it was.,"But with the help of a time machine, or something, maybe we can tweak the past just a little and make Sunday’s game just a little more like the recent squeakers.",Close your eyes and imagine:,The New Orleans Saints brought the N.F.L. title to Bourbon Street with a 49-41 victory over the New England Patriots destined to be a modern classic.,"Drew Brees led New Orleans’s high-powered offense, which scored 40 or more points six times this season, to one of its most potent results, throwing for six touchdowns.","The Saints had found their way into the Super Bowl after Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman was called for eight different penalties after his helmet-to-helmet hit on Tommylee Lewis in the N.F.C. championship game. The Saints scored on the next play, giving the Rams too far to come back.","Brees showed veteran poise on Sunday by repeatedly finding Lewis and Michael Thomas. “When you’re a young quarterback who has never been to the big game before, you will make mistakes against a great defense,” Brees said. “Thankfully no one like that faced the Patriots today.”","At 41, Tom Brady defied his years with an aerial show of his own that fell just short, taking advantage of a Saints defense that almost seemed to want him to score, just to get the ball back in Brees’s hands.","Only special teams fans were disappointed, as neither team ever sent out the punting unit.",Here are the fans celebrating:,The halftime show by Taylor Swift also got great reviews.,The Kansas City Chiefs won their first title since the days of Len Dawson with a 54-51 triumph over the Rams.,Patrick Mahomes threw for five touchdowns and ran for one more.,"The Chiefs had made it into the big game after an overtime victory in the A.F.C. championship; they won the coin toss and marched down the field to score, never giving the Patriots a touch.","Every time Mahomes got the ball on Sunday there was a sense that something exciting was about to happen: a no-look pass, a rocket fired into a tiny space, an improvisation that made something out of nothing. About the only thing you knew you weren’t going to get was a punt.","The Rams gave as good as they got, with Jared Goff picking apart the unheralded Chiefs defense for three touchdowns of his own. Todd Gurley provided fans of the running game something to cheer with a 100-yard effort.","Chiefs Coach Andy Reid kept things interesting, nearly throwing the game away late with puzzling clock management, repeatedly going into full huddle despite trailing with time expiring. But the error just made Mahomes’s eventual touchdown scramble with zero seconds on the clock all the more thrilling.","The Chiefs now look poised to become the sport’s new dynasty with the 23-year-old Mahomes ready to star for years to come. But the ageless Brady and the Patriots, the resurgent Eagles or Steelers, the Saints and Rams will have something to say as well. It looks like a golden age of Super Bowls is upon us.",The Chiefs hometown paper celebrated:,The halftime show by Cardi B. also got great reviews.,Now wasn’t that more satisfying? Maybe next year.
Opinion | How I Learned to Love the Patriots (Again) - The New York Times,"I became a besotted baseball fan at the age of 6, watching the Boston Red Sox, my mother’s ancestral team, march to the World Series against the New York Mets. My parents woke me up near midnight on Oct. 25, 1986, to come downstairs with them and “watch the Red Sox win” — an eventuality that was, at that moment, just a single out away. It remained one out away through three singles, a devastating wild pitch and an incident that shall not be described involving one William Joseph Buckner. I wept, slept and awoke a gloomy pessimist, forever haunted by the fall of man.","I became a football fan around the same time, and I figured I should root for the Patriots as well, in New England solidarity. They had recently played (albeit embarrassingly badly) in a Super Bowl, so I was unaware of their long, distinguished legacy of lousy play. But by the time I turned 10 and they were working their way through a 1-15 season, with a 2-14 encore just around the corner, I understood a little better the implications of my choice.","This combination of Red Sox tragedy and Patriot futility defined my relationship to professional sports until adulthood, at which point (as you may have heard) absolutely everything changed for both teams and they became insufferably dominant. And my fandom, forged in suffering and melodrama and “wait ’till next year” rue, never quite recovered from my favorite teams’ success.","Everyone leaves certain childish things behind, of course. But there is no greater chasm in the remembered continuity of the self than the gulf separating me from the version of myself whose mind was at least 35 percent baseball from February until October and 20 percent football for the rest of the year, who screamed and raved my way through crucial games and crucial months, and who once talked a boss into letting me off work early because of the psychic damage inflicted by Aaron Boone’s Sox-crushing, American League Championship Series-winning home run the prior night.","I remember that person, but I can’t remember how he felt. And trying to raise my children to be New England sports fans in an age of constant New England winning has given me real sympathy with the lukewarmly religious, the Christmas-and-Easter sort of believer who wants to impart some measure of piety to their children without really experiencing the flame of faith themselves.","There are reasons besides Bostonian sports success for the dying of that flame. My current editors probably wouldn’t let me out of column writing after a devastating loss, and normal adult obligations leave less time for rereading Roger Angell’s season-recapping baseball essays for the 847th time.","But the frequent triumphs of the Sox and Pats have been crucial to my loss of ardor. In the old days I was always mystified about how Yankee fans stirred up the same excitement year after year despite their constant winning, and as my teams became increasingly Yankee-like the mystification remained. Indeed, I missed the thirst enough to seek the feeling elsewhere — adopting long-suffering franchises temporarily (until the Kansas City Royals ruined our affair by winning the World Series) to remind myself of what it was like to nourish long-unrequited hopes.","Despite that infidelity, though, I’ve never taken the step of actually rooting against one of my childhood teams. Which has kept me connected to both of them, however dutifully.","And now that the Patriots have ground their way, in a terrible-to-watch game highlighted by punts, to yet another Super Bowl victory, I want to report a change in my sports psychology. In my dutiful connection to the latest run of Patriot Super Bowl appearances, I have begun to feel something different, strange and unfamiliar — not a recovery of the old romance, but a growing appreciation of pure, ruthless effectiveness, an admiration for iron efficiency, a joy at the dismantling of highly touted rivals, a feeling that almost … almost … makes me begin to have a trace of a scintilla of understanding for what it feels like to be a Yankees fan.","I say this as someone who feels no particularly personal sympathy or affection for the two men, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, who have delivered the Patriots their extraordinary dynasty. Belichick is an unpleasant perfectionist whose cultivated public misanthropy and “look at me, a slob” outfits often seem like an irritating sort of performance art. Brady preferred the supermodel charms of Gisele Bündchen to Bridget Moynahan, the nice Catholic ex-girlfriend (I saw them at Mass together once, so I'm totally in her camp) who was carrying his child — and then succumbed, via Gisele, to a pro-athlete equivalent of the Gwyneth Paltrow-Goop worldview.","And without delving into the arcana of Deflategate, it’s obvious that the Patriots’ search for a competitive edge has taken them to at least the edge of, you know, cheating.","So the old fake-personal bond that I felt for my flawed New England heroes — Yaz! Nomah! Bledsoe! — isn’t there with Brady and Belichick today. What is there, and increasingly as their dynasty has become more improbably extended, is something very different: a zest for on-field excellence simply for its own sake, a forgiveness of personal and even moral deficiencies because the record speaks for itself, a setting aside of feel-good narratives and romantic underdog stories because the sheer force of winning trumps them all.","Oh, did someone say Trump? Yes, it’s appropriate that the Patriots are Donald Trump’s favorite team, but not because they have too many white players or because their consistent, grinding, rigorous success somehow resembles his improbable and often ridiculous ascent. Rather it’s because the Patriots are the actual thing that his grifter’s instincts and “Great Again” sloganeering are constantly trying to evoke — a dependably, reliably excellent American institution, of the kind that people in the pre-Vietnam era took for granted, and that our own era struggles to reproduce.","The Patriots are to football what the Apollo and Manhattan Projects were to military-industrial-complex science, what IBM and General Motors were to big business, what the Hoover Dam and Mount Rushmore were to public works — with Belichick as their Patton-meets-Eisenhower impresario, by turns a jerk and a bore but a winner above all. They are a throwback, a constant rebuke to the decadence visible in every other American institution (their First Fan’s White House very much included), a last bloom of the can-do genius that won us World War II …","… sorry, getting a little carried away here. The point is that unlike my beloved Red Sox, who now win just often enough to make me feel some Catholic-with-Calvinist-ancestors guilt over their success, the Patriots have over the last few years passed into new territory, a new sphere of fan experience. For the first time since I was in college and they were scrappy underdogs, their every victory makes me want them to win more — to boldly go, like Neil Armstrong and James T. Kirk, where no team has gone before …","… sorry, carried away again. The point, the point, is that I am a changed fan, or at least a changing one. With every Patriot victory, I am winning the victory over myself. I am shedding old habits, jettisoning the underdoggery and romance of my childhood, learning to love dynastic rule.",The Super Bowl is over. But next season is coming. Brady isn’t retiring. Belichick is going back to his tapes and plots and schemes. Six Super Bowl rings? That’s nothing.,How did Patton put it? Americans love a winner and can’t tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time …,Let’s make it seven.

We often discuss the need for more women in the boardroom, but what about in the locker room, a team’s back office and on the sidelines?","So I was encouraged this weekend to see Sarah Thomas become the first woman to officiate an N.F.L. playoff game. Thomas, a Mississippi native and a mother of three, had already broken plenty of ground in the sport — becoming the first full-time female official in N.F.L. history in 2015. She was also the first woman to referee a major college football game, a bowl game and a game in a Big Ten stadium.","Thomas wasn’t the only first over the weekend. In a playoff game on Saturday, Terri Valenti became the first female replay official.","The news got me thinking about the women who had already changed football — the ones who have smashed through the gender wall without pads, a helmet or much fanfare.

Boring Game Plus New Orleans Rebellion Leads to Ratings Drop - The New York Times,"It was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, a universally agreed-upon snoozefest. The halftime show was forgettable. The commercials were tame.","The fans watching at home noticed, and Super Bowl broadcaster CBS paid the price.","CBS announced Monday that 98.2 million people watched the New England Patriots defeat the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, on CBS, the smallest television audience since 2008, when the New York Giants defeated the Patriots. That is a 5 percent drop from last year, when 103.4 million people watched the Super Bowl on NBC, and a 12 percent drop from 2017, when 111.3 million people watched it on Fox. CBS said 2.6 million people streamed the Super Bowl, setting a digital viewership record, for a total audience of 100.7 million, which means compared with two years ago, people really did not care for this Super Bowl.","That was especially true in New Orleans, where a sense of righteous indignation from fans whose hometown Saints were the victims of poor refereeing contributed to the audience collapse. The Saints lost to the Rams in the N.F.C. championship game after a blown call helped the Rams send the game to overtime. The N.F.L.’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, later admitted the call was blown.","Though New Orleans isn’t one of the country’s largest television markets, it is one of the most fervent for football, typically rating among the highest in the country for the proportion of households watching the Super Bowl. But Sunday’s game only earned a 26.1 overnight rating in New Orleans; last year’s Super Bowl earned a 53.0. It was the lowest rating for New Orleans in Super Bowl history.","Instead of watching the game, thousands of Saints fans staged a French Quarter protest parade. LaToya Cantrell, the mayor of New Orleans, even showed up at the Boycott Bowl concert. A number of Saints fans have filed long-shot lawsuits against the N.F.L.","The local newspaper, The Times-Picayune, got in on the fun too. “Super Bowl? What Super Bowl?” asked the front page of Monday’s edition, which was otherwise blank. A former Saints running back, Pierre Thomas, certainly agreed, tweeting approvingly that the front page was “championship level petty.”","Fans in Kansas City, whose Chiefs lost to the Patriots in the A.F.C. championship game, were also turned off, though not nearly to the same extent. Super Bowl ratings in Kansas City were down 11 percent compared to last year.","The Super Bowl’s smaller viewership ran counter to the success the N.F.L. had on television this season. Every time slot for N.F.L. game earned higher ratings during the 2018 regular season, a total gain of 5 percent.","The regular season pointing one way and the Super Bowl pointing another isn’t necessarily unusual. Both the 2017 and 2018 Super Bowls suffered modest overnight ratings declines from the previous Super Bowl, but they were smaller than the major viewership declines the N.F.L. suffered during both of those regular seasons.","There was also some unknown number of people who boycotted the game because of what they view as the unfair treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has not been able to land even a backup job with an N.F.L. team the past two seasons. Kaepernick became a controversial figure in 2016 when he began kneeling during the national anthem to bring attention to police brutality and other issues affecting minorities and economically disadvantaged people in America.","Despite the fourth straight year of a viewership decline, the Super Bowl will almost assuredly be the year’s most-watched program, boasting tens of millions more viewers than anything else on television. In a fragmenting market and amid declining audiences for traditional television across the board, football remains king. In 2018, 46 of the top 50 most watched telecasts were N.F.L. games."

"When the Whole Country Reviews a Play, Referees Can’t Always Join - The New York Times","More than 50 cameras blanketed the Superdome on Sunday afternoon, ensuring endless angles and replays of every highlight from the N.F.C. championship game between the New Orleans Saints and Los Angeles Rams.","At stake was a trip to next month’s Super Bowl, but when the officials needed a replay most, the N.F.L.’s complicated rules for what is and is not subject to video review prohibited them from watching one, even in the midst of a game that cost tens of millions of dollars to produce and is among the most watched events on television.","So, despite dizzying rules changes and stunning camera angles all aimed at getting the calls right, the decision came down to a simple fact: The most important guy was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and nobody could do anything about it.","Those rules might change this off-season, though in the past the N.F.L. has shown little appetite for making penalties reviewable because they are considered judgment calls. This means that rulings of fact — such as whether a ball crossed the goal line, or a foot touched the sideline, or whether a pass is complete — are reviewable. Whether a player committed holding or pass interference is not.","In the minute after a crucial late-game play on which referees could have called two separate penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman but opted to call none, Fox’s broadcast team showed five separate replays that made clear officials had made a terrible mistake. It appeared to cost the Saints an advantage that could have led to their winning the game. As those replays rolled, the side judge Gary Cavaletto, who was near the play, endured an earful from Saints Coach Sean Payton.","However, in an era when anyone watching on a high-definition television at home has as good a view as the officials on the field do, as well as the benefit of reverse angles and slow motion for each play, the harsh judgment of the world most often ends up carrying the day: The official screwed up.","The Saints owner Gayle Benson rendered her judgment in an emotional statement issued late Monday afternoon, vowing to make sure no team ever experiences what hers did Sunday.","“I have been in touch with the N.F.L. regarding yesterday’s events and will aggressively pursue changes in N.F.L. policies to ensure no team and fan base is ever put in a similar position again,” Benson said. “The N.F.L. must always commit to providing the most basic of expectations — fairness and integrity.”","The league declined to issue a statement about what will undoubtedly become one of the most notorious non-calls in the league’s history. An N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, also declined to comment when asked about the play. The head official for the game, Bill Vinovich, told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play, pointing out that plays involving potential pass interference are not reviewable.","The closest thing to an official league position came from Payton, the Saints’ head coach. After the game, he said he had spoken on the phone with Alberto Riveron, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of officiating, who told him the officials botched the call, a position the league chose not to refute.","While the relative silence may seem odd in the age of very public apologies and mea culpas, the N.F.L. actually has no consistent strategy for dealing with high-profile officiating errors, a reflection of what is often an idiosyncratic approach to crisis management. Sometimes Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, chooses to say plenty; other times he says nothing at all.","When it comes to major officiating mistakes, oftentimes what happened does not become clear until years later, when the official involved chooses to speak.","Bill Leavy can’t forget Super Bowl XL. As an N.F.L. referee, officiating the biggest game of the season should have been an honor for Leavy. Instead, it is the night he will always remember for all the wrong reasons.","Leavy and his crew made several controversial calls that went against the Seattle Seahawks, who ended up losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers by 21-10. The league tried to protect Leavy’s crew when it said the game was “properly officiated.”","Years later, Leavy acknowledged the missed calls and said they still weighed on him.","“It left me with a lot of sleepless nights, and I think about it constantly,” Leavy told reporters in Seattle in 2010, four years after the game. “I’ll go to my grave wishing that I’d been better.”","Video replay was supposed to rectify much of that. The former N.F.L. coach Mike Holmgren refers to it as the “50 guys in a bar” rule. If 50 people watching in a bar agree it’s a bad call, it should probably be overturned. Yet, like a lot of things that happen in the N.F.L., which has a dense, 89-page rule book, it is never that simple.","Cavaletto might want to heed Leavy’s remorse. Cavaletto, the side judge in the N.F.C. championship game on Sunday, has been widely ridiculed for not calling a penalty late in the fourth quarter on Robey-Coleman, who drilled New Orleans Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis before the ball arrived.","Cavaletto, who did not grant an interview, and the other referees could have called penalties for pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet hit, but they chose to call neither.","The Saints settled for a field goal, but enough time remained on the clock for the Rams to march down the field and kick a field goal that sent the game into overtime. The Rams ended up winning the game, 26-23.","“It was simple: They blew the call,” Payton said after the game.","Cavaletto, 63, spent most of his N.F.L. career as a field judge before becoming a sideline judge before the 2014 season. He worked Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, between the Giants and New England Patriots.","He is a 1973 graduate of Bishop Diego High School in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he played football, baseball and basketball. Cavaletto later played parts of three seasons in the Atlanta Braves minor league system, as a first baseman.","After washing out of baseball, Cavaletto became a three-sport official, officiating Division I college basketball and baseball games, as well as Canadian Football League and Arena Football League games, before making his N.F.L. debut in 2003.","He, too, will most likely live with his non-call for years to come.","In the past, officials involved in controversial calls have not worked subsequent games involving the aggrieved team. It is a good bet, then, that Cavaletto will not be seen at future Saints games.","Infuriated Saints fans, who have long insisted that the N.F.L. remains biased against them because its coaches were found to have rewarded injuring opponents, took to social media after the game to note that Cavaletto lives a mere two hours from Los Angeles.",His non-call may also lead to change.,"That is, after all, what happened after a series of mistakes involving the N.F.L.’s so-called “tuck rule.”","The most famous invocation of that rule came during a playoff game in 2002, when a fumble by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass after a replay review by the referee Walt Coleman. Brady’s arm, Coleman ruled, had begun a forward movement before he attempted to tuck the ball back toward his body. The Patriots went on to defeat the Oakland Raiders in overtime.","While the N.F.L. elected to leave the rule as-is following that game, a push to make a change began in earnest after another instance in a 2011 playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Kansas City Chiefs. Finally, in 2013, after continued consternation over the regulation, the N.F.L. abolished the tuck rule.","Even though Coleman officiated for 17 seasons after the game before retiring this year, he never officiated another Raiders game.",
"In the Din of the Dome, the Rams Beat the Saints in Overtime - The New York Times","The triumphant locker room at the Super Dome started out so crowded Sunday night that personal space seemed like an extravagance. But as the room emptied, and the jubilant Los Angeles Rams continued a celebration that would rival any bacchanalia in this city’s French Quarter, the player who helped preserve their season by blatantly breaking the rules stood in the middle of it all, still in full uniform, delighted to answer question after question about his fateful, and fortunate, moment.","Amid the mayhem after a 26-23 overtime victory that propelled the Rams past the Saints and into the Super Bowl, that player, cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, got his first look at the replay of his helmet-to-helmet, fourth-quarter thump on New Orleans receiver Tommylee Lewis. Peering at a reporter’s cell phone, he could see himself slide into view and clobber Lewis before the pass arrived.","For Robey-Coleman, it was just visual confirmation for what he already knew — he had been guilty of pass interference on Lewis and somehow had gotten away with it.","“I felt more than lucky,” Robey-Coleman said, when asked how he felt when no penalty was called, allowing the Rams to stay within 3 points when the Saints were forced to kick a field goal rather than go for a touchdown. “I felt blessed.”","The repercussions of that play will be felt everywhere from the league office, which acknowledged to New Orleans Coach Sean Payton afterward that the officiating crew botched the call, to this mystical city, which will now mourn a second consecutive infuriating exit from the postseason for their beloved Saints. Just 53 weeks ago, the Saints lost in the divisional round of the playoffs when Minnesota scored on a last-second, 61-yard touchdown — nearly the same distance as Greg Zuerlein’s 57-yard field goal that doomed them on Sunday.","But in the giddy aftermath of Sunday’s game, the missed call maybe resonated even deeper for a Los Angeles franchise that went 4-12 two seasons ago after relocating to Southern California from St. Louis and entrusted a 30-year-old coaching prodigy, Sean McVay, to return the Rams to prominence. And now, on the 39-year anniversary of their only Super Bowl appearance as a Los Angeles franchise, the Rams have advanced there for the second time.","“We walked into the interview saying, ‘How on earth could we hire a 30-year-old? We walked out of the interview saying, ‘How could we not hire Sean McVay?” the Rams’ chief operating officer, Kevin Demoff, said in recalling the decision to hire McVay.","“He’s a great football coach,’’ Demoff added. “He’s not a quarterback whisperer. He’s not an offensive genius. Today he found a great way for our team to play complementary football. We kicked two field goals to go to the Super Bowl.”","In one night, the Rams vindicated two off-seasons’ worth of bold personnel moves intended to turn a middling team from St. Louis into a champion in Los Angeles. Having pierced the aura of the Superdome, where Payton and quarterback Drew Brees had won their previous six playoff games, the Rams will now face New England on Feb. 3 in Atlanta.","It is not a surprise that the Patriots – who also advanced with an overtime victory, by 37-31 at top-seeded Kansas City – will be there. They always are. But the Rams have gotten this far because, at bottom, every move they made after losing to Atlanta in the playoffs last year, all the off-season splurges and in-season roster churn, positioned them to thrive amid the jackhammer-in-your-ear din that they confronted on Sunday in the Superdome.","“We didn’t feel pressure,” said cornerback Aqib Talib, one of several new players on the Rams’ revamped defense. “We applied it.”","This N.F.C. title-game matchup registered somewhere between sunrise and sunset on the inevitability scale. Since September, New Orleans and Los Angeles had jockeyed for the conference’s top seed, with one coaching mastermind named Sean striving to duplicate the success of another. No other matchup embodied the season’s offensive boom better than having the conference’s most prolific teams — who combined for 80 points in the Saints’ Week 9 home victory over the Rams — vying to outscore each other for a second time.","On Sunday, a full quarter elapsed before the Rams looked comfortable — or, at least, they no longer looked sleeping-above-an-alligator-pit uncomfortable — and then gradually, they chiseled away at the Saints’ lead. They trailed by 13 after the first quarter but by just 3 at halftime and ultimately tied the score, at 20-20, on Zuerlein’s 24-yarder with 5:03 left in the game.","The other day in the Saints’ cafeteria, Brees, newly 40, glanced up and saw himself on television. The channel was showing the N.F.C. championship game from 2010, the last time New Orleans played in the Super Bowl. His teammates ribbed him about all the hair he had nine years ago, all the hair he seems to have lost.","Seizing the chance Sunday to lead them to another, Brees drove the Saints to the Rams’ 13. On third-and-10, Lewis scooted out of the backfield and ran a wheel route. Brees saw him and released a pass down the near sideline — the Saints’ sideline — toward Lewis, who was now inside the 5-yard line. The ball never reached him. Robey-Coleman made certain of that.","The officiating crew, which could have called any number of penalties on the play — pass interference and unnecessary roughness among them — opted to call none. The referee, Bill Vinovich, told a pool reporter that he “personally” had not seen what occurred.","The Saints protested. Payton ranted and screamed. The public-address announcer admonished fans not to throw debris onto the field. Instead of scoring a touchdown or draining time off the clock, the Saints settled for Wil Lutz’s 31-yard field goal that put them ahead by 23-20.","“It was simple: They blew the call,” Payton said.","For the Rams and for Jared Goff, the quarterback who blossomed under McVay’s tutelage and became one of the best in the league, 101 seconds remained to tie or even win the game. Goff, who overcame a first-quarter interception to complete 25 of 40 passes for 297 yards and a touchdown, proceeded to direct the Rams into field-goal range, and Zuerlein equalized from 48 yards with just 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter.","After winning the overtime coin toss, knowing that a touchdown would win the game but a field goal would return the ball to the Rams, New Orleans faced a 2nd-and-16 at its 34. Charging on a stunt, Rams linebacker Dante Fowler, acquired from Jacksonville by the trade deadline, reached Brees and hit him in the wrist as he threw, causing his pass to float. Safety John Johnson, defending Michael Thomas, watched the ball reach its apex from his back. He barely moved as he intercepted it.","“I saw it the whole way,” Johnson said. “I’m glad I got my contacts in. I probably would have dropped it if I didn’t.”","Goff ran back onto the field, the Rams with the ball at their own 46, five plays from deliverance, and General Manager Les Snead said it all felt akin to climbing the 18th green at Augusta National Golf Club.","“The hole gets smaller,” Snead said.","Demoff harked back to a conversation he had with Goff after that miserable 2016 season, when he lost all seven of his starts. Goff told him that he knew how to turn around the franchise since, he said, he had done it in college, at Berkeley. “I know we’re not that far,” Goff told him at the time, and indeed the Rams weren’t.","They won a second consecutive N.F.C. West title this season. They beat Dallas last week, and when Zuerlein went on to kick his 57-yarder, they had conquered New Orleans as well. The fact that the referees helped the Rams, too, won’t make them any less proud.","“The referee made the call, we respect it,” Robey-Coleman said. “Now I’m going to the Super Bowl. Nobody can change that.”",— Ben Shpigel,"[The New England Patriots beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 37-31, in the A.F.C. championship game Sunday, and will face the winner of this game in the Super Bowl. See how they did it here.]",Here’s how the Rams beat the Saints:,He’s known as Greg the Leg for a reason.,"A 57-yard kick by Zuerlein has sent the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2001.

The Rams got down to the 31 yard line, but the Saints defense held firm, and a 48-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein tied the game with 19 seconds left. The Saints elected to kneel it to send it to the extra period.",But that no-call on the Lewis play on the last drive continues to look worse and worse.

Hard to believe.,— Zach Schonbrun,"Saints settle for a field goal to take a 23-20 lead and give the Rams back the ball with 1 minute 41 seconds left and one timeout. But the Saints and the fans were upset that Rams cornerback Robey-Coleman hit Tommylee Lewis early on a pass out in the flat. Both players went up for the ball, but Coleman connected with Lewis before the ball touched him. Fans are booing and, from replay, it certainly looked like the flag should have been thrown there. That could have ended the game because the Saints could have run down the clock before kicking a field goal. Once again, an N.F.L. playoff game could be decided by the referees.",— Zach Schonbrun,"You just knew the Saints were going to try to take a shot downfield at some point. They've been thriving on their usual mix of underneath passes and creative screens, but, with time ticking down to the two-minute warning, Brees finally uncorked a bomb to Ted Ginn Jr., who out-leaped the safety Lamarcus Joyner for the ball 43 yards downfield. The Saints are now in the red zone with three timeouts and less than two minutes left.",— Zach Schonbrun,"After trailing 13-0, the Rams have climbed back to tie it with just about five minutes remaining. After starting the drive on their own 9-yard line, Goff drove his team all the way down the field, and a rush by C.J. Anderson was stopped on the 1-yard line. Rams Coach Sean McVay likes to be aggressive, but going for it on fourth down and passing up the chance to tie was a bit too risky even for him. So after a field goal, we are all even.",— Zach Schonbrun,"That was a huge series for the Saints defense, which forced the Rams to punt from their own 12-yard line — and just when the Rams looked to be seizing momentum (again). Add in a personal foul against the Rams on the punt, and the Saints will take over at the Rams' 46.",— Scott Cacciola,"Rams continue to gash the Saints for big yardage plays, just as they did against the Dallas Cowboys last week. Brandin Cooks now has 100 yards receiving after a 25-yard catch and run.

After the score, Higbee immediately put his finger to his lips. Shhhhhhhh. (Don't think the Saints fans will listen, though).",— Zach Schonbrun,"So much for the Rams’ momentum. After they went three-and-out on their opening series of the second half, the Saints took over and marched down the field. Their 12-play, 71-yard drive culminated in a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brees to Taysom Hill, the team’s third-string quarterback. (!) But really, that drive was all about Alvin Kamara, the Saints’ do-everything tailback. Kamara caught four passes for 34 yards and ran once for 6 yards, sparking New Orleans — and the crowd is once again in a tizzy.",— Scott Cacciola,"Don't count the Rams out yet. They turned up the defensive pressure on Brees, sacking him on consecutive plays.

A touchdown run by Gurley (remember him?) makes it a 13-10 game at halftime.",— Zach Schonbrun,"That series was the best possible sequence of events for the Rams. Not only did Gurley get involved with the touchdown run — welcome back, Todd — but the Rams also absolutely silenced the crowd before halftime. And don't forget: The Rams will get the ball to start the second half.",— Scott Cacciola,"Something to watch: The Rams have gone away from Todd Gurley, their All-Pro running back, since that early pass that wound up being an interception slipped through his hands.

(The result was a field goal to get on the board, 13-3).","On the other side, the Saints’ special teams were the most efficient in the N.F.L. this season, led by the well-respected Mike Westhoff.

And just to give Saints fans a friendly nudge, the game operations department here keeps flashing a giant ""MAKE NOISE"" sign on the Jumbotron, with flames licking all the letters. Noise, of course, is part of the strategy. Veterans in the press box who have been to many sports events here at the Superdome are saying this is the loudest they've heard it — and the noise is clearly affecting the Rams. Jared Goff had the experience of playing against the Saints here earlier this season, but suffice it to say the atmosphere was slightly more muted back in November than it is today.",— Scott Cacciola,"Fifteen. That's the total yardage for the Rams in the first quarter, their lowest total for a quarter this season. That does not include a single first down. And they're facing another third down when the second quarter begins. More alarming: The crowd noise at the Superdome caused the Rams to commit a false start AFTER they had just called a timeout … because of the crowd noise.",— Zach Schonbrun,It’s starting to look like a nightmarish start for the Rams in New Orleans.,"In the red zone for a third time already in the first quarter, the Saints brought their do-everything backup quarterback Taysom Hill in on third down but could not convert the run-pass option play. No matter: New Orleans brought Brees back onto the field on 4th and 2 from the 10-yard line, and he got the Rams to jump offside.","On the next play, two Rams defenders ran into each other, and Brees found Garrett Griffin wide open in the end zone. 13-0 New Orleans.",Los Angeles looks completely out of sorts on defense. But the Saints have that effect on a lot of teams.,— Zach Schonbrun,"It’s probably worth noting the colossal difference in time of possession here so far: While the Rams have had the ball for a grand total of 3 minutes 9 seconds, the Saints have had it for 10:16. The Rams’ defense is already working hard, and probably did well to limit the Saints to two field goals on their first two series. Goff and his offense could do the defense a huge favor by keeping the ball here for more than another three-and-out.",— Scott Cacciola,"On the N.F.L.'s radio broadcast, they are reporting that Rams quarterback Jared Goff was having problems with the audio inside his helmet, meaning he couldn't hear Coach Sean McVay. The Rams are hoping that the issue is resolved.",— Scott Cacciola,"Oh boy. New Orleans forces a turnover as a dropped pass by Todd Gurley goes right into the arms of Saints linebacker Demario Davis on the Rams' own 16-yard line. It was L.A.'s first turnover in three games, and it gives New Orleans a chance to take a commanding early start.",— Zach Schonbrun,"It did not take long for Drew Brees to make a little history. With his third completion of the Saints’ opening drive, he passed the great Dan Marino for sixth on the all-time postseason completions list with 385. Incidentally, the Rams made an unusual decision to defer after winning the coin toss, giving the Saints the ball to start — a small gamble when Brees is the opposing quarterback and this crowd is fired up. (The kids might refer to the Superdome as “lit.”) All things considered the Rams were fortunate to get off the field after giving up just a field goal.",— Scott Cacciola,"The last time the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints met, they combined for 80 points and 970 yards of offense, and the Saints ended the Rams’ dreams of going undefeated the entire season.",Here is what to know now:
Robert Kraft Facing First-Degree Misdemeanors in Prostitution Case - The New York Times,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Three weeks and a day after he watched his team win its sixth Super Bowl championship, Robert K. Kraft was formally charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution.","Mr. Kraft, who lives in Massachusetts but has owned property in Palm Beach, Fla., for a number of years, was one of 25 men caught in a sting operation at a spa called Orchids of Asia, a small storefront business in a strip mall in Jupiter, Fla.","On Friday, Jupiter police filed two second-degree charges against Mr. Kraft, but State Attorney Dave Aronberg of Palm Beach County increased the severity of the charges to two first-degree misdemeanors. If convicted, Mr. Kraft could face up to a year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service, Mr. Aronberg said. He added that it was unlikely a first-time offender would spend time in jail.","“Human trafficking is evil in our midst,” Mr. Aronberg said. “It is fueled on the demand side.”","The charges are the latest crisis for the Patriots and Mr. Kraft, who is one of the N.F.L.’s most powerful owners, a trustee emeritus and longtime benefactor of Columbia University and a friend of President Trump’s. Mr. Aronberg made it clear that Mr. Kraft would not receive special treatment because of his prominence.","“Our office treats everyone the same, whether you have a lot of money or are indigent,” Mr. Aronberg said. “No one gets special treatment in Palm Beach County.”","The N.F.L., which will have to consider a punishment for Mr. Kraft, released a statement expressing the same sentiment Monday morning.","“Our Personal Conduct Policy applies equally to everyone in the N.F.L.,” the unsigned league statement read. “We will handle this allegation in the same way we would handle any issue under the policy. We are seeking a full understanding of the facts, while ensuring that we do not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation. We will take appropriate action as warranted based on the facts.”","Through the Patriots, Mr. Kraft has denied engaging in illegal activity. A team spokesman said on Monday that the Patriots would not comment on the new charges.","Mr. Aronberg said that because Mr. Kraft was considered a local resident, he had received a summons in the mail. He will not be booked into the local jail or appear in a mug shot. His lawyer can appear on his behalf in court.","Details of the case against Mr. Kraft emerged Monday through an affidavit, which described his two visits to the spa that were caught on video.","According to the affidavit, one of Mr. Kraft’s visits occurred in the late afternoon of Jan. 19, a Saturday. He arrived in a 2014 white, chauffeur-driven Bentley, and he was wearing a blue shirt and ball cap, the affidavit said. He spent about 40 minutes at the spa, during which time he undressed and lay on his back on a massage table as a woman massaged his genitals.","As Mr. Kraft left the spa, the police followed the car, pulling it over in what was described as a traffic stop, and identified the owner of the Patriots.","The next day, hours before the start of the A.F.C. championship game, Kraft arrived at the spa just before 11 a.m. He entered the room and hugged a masseuse. Once again, a woman was observed with her hands on his genitals, according to the affidavit, and then she was seen placing her head close to his pelvic area. The woman helped him get dressed. Mr. Kraft hugged her and gave her a $100 bill and another, unidentifiable form of currency. He was on his way 14 minutes after he arrived.","Mr. Kraft later traveled to Kansas City, where he watched the Patriots defeat the Chiefs to earn their third consecutive trip to the Super Bowl.","“This is not about lonely old men or victimless crime,” Mr. Aronberg said. “This is about enabling a network of criminals to traffic women into our country for forced labor and sex.”","On Friday, the Jupiter police announced the charges, the result of an investigation into human trafficking that involved multiple agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. None of the men charged in the sting have been accused of being involved with human trafficking.","Mr. Kraft is a member of the league’s powerful broadcast committee, as well as the compensation committee, which sets Commissioner Roger Goodell’s salary. Mr. Goodell, who has striven to convince fans that the N.F.L. is a female-friendly organization after several high-profile incidents of domestic violence involving players, now could be in a position to fine or suspend Mr. Kraft for his conduct.","The N.F.L. gives Mr. Goodell broad authority to hold players and owners accountable for conduct he deems detrimental to the league. Previous punishments have included fines and suspensions, but also prohibitions that have barred owners from being at their team facilities or from attending games.","The N.F.L. maintains a “reserve/commissioner exempt list” for players who are being investigated by the league for conduct violations. This is the list that Kareem Hunt, the former Kansas City Chiefs running back, landed on after video emerged of him pushing and kicking a woman. (The Chiefs cut him shortly after the video became public and the league put Hunt on the exempt list; Hunt signed with the Cleveland Browns this month, though he has not yet been cleared to play.)","Players on the exempt list cannot practice or attend games, but they continue to be paid. It is not clear whether Mr. Goodell would suspend an owner pending the outcome of an investigation.","Mr. Goodell is hired and paid by the owners, making his decision on potential discipline for Mr. Kraft a tricky one.","Mr. Kraft and Mr. Goodell had been considered longtime allies. Their relationship was strained, however, by two earlier punishments for the Patriots: when Mr. Goodell disciplined the franchise for spying on other teams in 2007, and when he penalized the team and quarterback Tom Brady in a case that began in 2015 about deflating footballs for a competitive advantage.","The team came under larger scrutiny when one of its players, Aaron Hernandez, was charged with first-degree murder. He was convicted in 2015, and he killed himself in his cell in 2017."
"On Way to Super Bowl, the Patriots Moved the Ball and the Line - The New York Times","As another N.F.L. season winds to a close, the New England Patriots find themselves in a familiar position: favorites in the Super Bowl. But it wasn’t certain they would hold the honor until nearly the last minute.","For much of the season, the Patriots were considered a tier below the best teams; for months, that group included the Saints, the Chiefs and the Rams. Throughout the season, bookmakers offering early Super Bowl wagering made the N.F.C. entrant — whomever it turned out to be — a 3-point favorite over a generic A.F.C. representative.","As the big game got closer, however, oddsmakers began offering odds on hypothetical Super Bowl matchups. The Rams were generally listed as a 1-point favorite over the Patriots as recently as a week ago.",Then the teams played their conference championship game.,"“Everything is about public perception: What have you done for me lately?” said Scott Cooley, a spokesman for the online gambling site BetDSI. “As we saw the Rams game unfold, they were down the entire game, they benefited from an egregious miscall. Maybe this team is not as strong as we thought they were.",“The Patriots were dominant on the road over a Chiefs squad that was favored. The manner in which the last two quarters unfolded: marching down the field and scoring in overtime — the Rams won in less convincing fashion.”,"Immediately after the Super Bowl matchup was confirmed, many bookmakers made Rams-Patriots a pick ’em game. Bettors reacted quickly.","""We opened at even,” said Marco Blume, trading director at Pinnacle Sports. “Then the action came almost immediately on the Patriots.” All that action has led Pinnacle to recalculate, and make the Patriots a 2-point favorite.","“We know the Patriots are a public team,” Cooley said. “They are always going to be wagered on by the Average Joe bettor. The Patriots, the Cowboys, the Packers. They are going to blindly bet on those teams.”","Cooley identified the key moment when the Patriots started gaining respect as the divisional round against the Chargers. “Smart pro bettors were betting the Chargers, though the public still liked the Patriots,” he said. “The spread went from Patriots by 5, down to 3½. And the Pats crushed them.”","At that point, casual fans and smart bettors alike started to realize that “this isn’t a feeble Patriots team,” Cooley said. “Maybe Gronk isn’t doing the damage he once did, but you’d be hard-pressed to bet against them.”","Could the line, now 2 at most places, keep moving to Patriots by 3 or even 4 by a week from Sunday? Probably not, several bookmakers said.","“We’re going to reach peak on the Patriots soon,” Blume said. “Sharp customers may look to get a bargain on the Rams. People are waiting. The sharps have a number in their heads, and as soon as they see a chance, they will pounce on you.”","The Patriots’ current status as 2-point favorites defies computer rankings, though, which are the basis of most lines. In Jeff Sagarin’s main ranking, the Patriots are a mere four-hundredths of a point better than the Rams. In his Predictor rating, in which many bettors put even more stock, the Rams are actually a half-point better.",But the bets keep coming in on New England.,"“People love Tom Brady,” Blume said.","It wasn’t always this way. In the first Super Bowl of the Brady era, in February 2002, the Patriots were 14-point underdogs to the 14-2 St. Louis Rams. The Patriots won anyway.","Bettors learned. The Patriots have been Super Bowl favorites six times in seven games since then, ranging from 2½ points to 12. In one game, against the Seahawks after the 2014 season, the line was even. The Pats won four of those seven games, but covered the spread in only two of them.","Regardless of who wins on Feb. 3 in Atlanta, one thing seems sure: Points will be scored.","The over-under on the game is between 57 and 58, potentially the highest in Super Bowl history. The previous record was 57, for Atlanta-New England two years ago and New Orleans-Indianapolis in 2010.","Thanks to rule changes designed to protect players, the trend in football has been toward higher scoring games; over-unders in the 1960s were generally in the 30s. But that is not the only factor. Both of this year’s teams are seen as offensive powerhouses with slightly suspect defenses.","“If it was Bears-Ravens, we’d have a total in the 40s,” Cooley said.","Don’t expect a move into the 60s, however. Blume suggested it had topped out already. “I expect it to close a little bit lower,” he said."
"Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Big Boi Will Play Super Bowl Halftime - The New York Times",The N.F.L. on Sunday ended months of uncertainty by officially announcing Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi as the lineup for this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.,"In an indication of how fraught the debate around the high-profile performance has become, Scott released a statement on Sunday announcing that he and the N.F.L. will partner on a $500,000 donation to the social justice group Dream Corps — a move that seemed to be aimed at stemming a backlash from groups that have criticized the football league’s policies.","Sources familiar with the N.F.L.’s Super Bowl plans had confirmed the rock band Maroon 5 as the headliner as long ago as September, and Scott emerged last month as a reported addition to the Feb. 3 halftime performance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Big Boi, the newest name on the bill, is a member of the Atlanta rap group Outkast.","But the run-up to this year’s halftime announcement had turned into a skirmish over sports and politics, as artists and others criticized the N.F.L. over its treatment of Colin Kaepernick and other players who have taken a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice.","In February, the rapper Cardi B, who was featured on Maroon 5’s hit “Girls Like You” last year, told the celebrity news website TMZ that she would consider performing at a halftime show “when they hire Colin Kaepernick back.”","In a song released last June, Jay-Z rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.”","Scott’s involvement, specifically, has prompted criticism from some. In an interview with TMZ, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he thought Scott “should do what a lot of other major artists have done — say, ‘I’m not going to participate.’”","“You can’t fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus,” he added.","In a pair of tweets, the rapper Meek Mill responded to the news that Scott would be performing with, “For what????” and “He don’t need that he on fire already!”","And Gerald Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., told The Guardian that the chapter had contacted artists and asked them not to perform. “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the N.F.L.,” Griggs said. “They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr. Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.”","For his part, Van Jones, the president of Dream Corps and a founder of the group, celebrated the announcement in a post on Twitter, addressing Scott by his handle.","“This is great news!” Jones wrote. “Welcome, @trvisXX. Glad to have you with us, brother!”"
Robert Kraft’s Future in the Balance: ‘I Am Truly Sorry’ - The New York Times,"When you find yourself at 77 a billionaire six times over and an N.F.L. team owner practically running out of fingers for Super Bowl rings, there aren’t a ton of opportunities you haven’t already enjoyed. Private jets are your subways. Weekends with pals at $2,000-a-night island resorts are your backyard barbecues. The question “what to do for kicks?” becomes harder to answer.","That may be why Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, ended up on stage with Cardi B before Super Bowl LIII last month.","Mr. Kraft was at the pregame party hosted by Michael G. Rubin, the 46-year-old owner of Fanatics, the online sports merchandise company, and an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.","Cardi B was performing “Money.” (It goes: “I like boardin’ jets, I like mornin’ sex, but nothing in this world that I like more than checks.”) “Get out there and dance,” said Meek Mill, just off the stage, to Mr. Rubin and Mr. Kraft.","Mr. Rubin backed away. But Mr. Kraft, dressed in black and his signature Nike Air Force One sneakers, began to bust out some steps.","“He was moving more than I thought he could move,” Meek Mill said later. The video spread around the web.","It was about three weeks later, though, that news about Mr. Kraft really went viral. ","On Feb. 22, Mr. Kraft was charged with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting sex at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. He pleaded not guilty.","[Read more: Despite charges, Trump wants Robert Kraft at Super Bowl celebration.]","On Tuesday, prosecutors made an offer to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men facing charges: a fine and community service in return for admitting that if their cases were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win.","And on Wednesday, lawyers for Mr. Kraft and 14 other men filed a motion to prevent evidence in the case from being made public, including hidden camera video of the men at the massage parlor. ","As of Friday, Mr. Kraft, who declined to comment for this article, refused to sign the proposed deal.","And on Saturday, he released a statement. “I am truly sorry. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard,” it said, in part. “Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women; my morals and my soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years.”","The Kraft camp is very sensitive to the inferences that Mr. Kraft’s solicitation charges have anything to do with what prosecutors say is a larger investigation into sex trafficking. All told, dozens of men have been charged with soliciting prostitution.","“We have looked into it, we’ve looked at the charges brought, looked at the evidence, and there is zero evidence of human trafficking,” said William Burck, one of his attorneys.",The operators of the Jupiter spa have not been charged with sex trafficking; the women Mr. Kraft is accused of soliciting are 45 and 58 years old and are licensed massage therapists.,"Another woman, who ran a spa in Vero Beach, has been charged with trafficking, and the investigation continues, as does a conversation about the role of men seeking sex for money in the trafficking economy.","And Mr. Kraft’s name continues to propel the conversation about that investigation. “It makes my skin crawl to see him being smeared this way,” said Drew Bledsoe, the former Patriots quarterback.","While Mr. Bledsoe and others who are sympathetic to Mr. Kraft say prosecutors are using the solicitation charges against him largely to publicize their broader investigation, it remains true that the sex trade often exploits women who have few or no means to escape it.","As his lawyers fight the case, Mr. Kraft has been described by friends as conflicted. He is angry about what he did and ashamed of the embarrassment he has caused, yet insistent that he did nothing illegal and is defiant enough to hire a very expensive legal team to battle charges that most people settle quickly. ","Several people interviewed for this article say he continues, a month after the case became public, to break down in tears when discussing the situation.","Casual friends of Mr. Kraft think the public reaction is overblown. “I can understand someone being 77 and going to a massage parlor,” said Larry King, 85. “He’s an older man who finds himself with a need and he gets that need satisfied. Why do we care?”",Much of the fascination with this case stems from an as-yet unanswered question: Why was a gazillionaire going to a random strip mall massage parlor anyway?,And the attendant tabloid headlines are a consequence of Mr. Kraft’s fame and wealth. Here is one of the richest men in the country — a pal of President Trump and the owner of a dominant football team — charged with a seedy offense.,"Now he must face the group he may care about as much as his family: his fellow N.F.L. team owners, who will gather starting Sunday at the Biltmore hotel in Phoenix for their annual meeting. ","Last year the talk there surrounded Colin Kaepernick and players kneeling during the national anthem. This year, the chatter will be about what penalty the league may impose upon Mr. Kraft for “conduct detrimental to the league” — code for making the owners look bad.","Friends and colleagues in Mr. Kraft’s inner circle say that his current legal problems reveal his continuing struggle to recalibrate in the aftermath of the 2011 death of that “love of my life” — his wife, Myra. ","They married in 1963, when he was 22 and about to enroll in Harvard Business School and she was 21, going into her senior year at Brandeis University. They were married for 48 years when Mrs. Kraft died of ovarian cancer.","“Bobby was so devastated when Myra died,” said Steven J. Comen, who has known Mr. Kraft since they were in kindergarten. “It took him a long time to get his bearings. If you can imagine becoming married when they were kids, and having kids when they essentially were still kids, and having the partnership to build something that was so spectacular — and her going through such a long period of suffering and then dying — well, it would have been devastating to anyone.”","This wasn’t a situation where Mr. Kraft took care of the business and Mrs. Kraft saw to the home life, said Tom Brady, the Patriots’ quarterback for 19 years, who called from a family vacation to talk about his closeness with “RKK” and the Kraft family.","“I remember bringing my oldest son, Jack, in to her office and her playing with him on the floor, with blocks and Legos,” Mr. Brady said. “She was very influential in my life and in many players’ lives. She was the mother of four sons, so she knew what it was like being around boys.”","Mr. Kraft has had one serious girlfriend in the intervening years. He met Ricki Noel Lander, now 39, in 2012 at a party hosted by Steve Tisch, an owner of the New York Giants. They have gone through very public phases, like attending a New York City Ballet gala for which Ms. Lander served as a chair, along with Sarah Jessica Parker, in 2016, and she appeared on the field with him after Super Bowl wins, including after the most recent one. ","They also have maintained separate lives. In 2017, Ms. Lander became a mother to a baby girl. The Patriots released a statement that said, “While Robert Kraft is not the biological father, he is thrilled with Ricki’s blessing of having a healthy child.” (Attempts to reach Ms. Lander were unsuccessful.)",Public and private reaction to Mr. Kraft’s most recent newsworthiness is complicated. Most of his fellow N.F.L. owners are reluctant to speak publicly about his crisis.,"But his fight against a relatively minor charge, using high-priced lawyers, is evidence of his sense of self-importance, possibly prolonging the media attention, according to at least one person familiar with that world. ","“The problem with Kraft is the problem with famous people, which is you bring famous attorneys and think they will do a better job,” said Hugh Culverhouse Jr., a former prosecutor and lawyer in Florida and son of the former owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “It’s like going to a knife fight with the entire Seventh Army.”","Some politicians, including Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said they intend to give the campaign donations they received from Mr. Kraft to groups focused on ending human trafficking, according to The Boston Globe. A group of survivors of sexual exploitation are planning to send a letter to the N.F.L. to ask that Mr. Kraft be barred from owning a team.","These days, Mr. Kraft is leaning heavily on one of his closest friends, Mr. Rubin, 30 years his junior. Like Mr. Kraft, Mr. Rubin is a billionaire who is branching into professional sports ownership.","“We talk on the phone five times a day,” said Mr. Rubin in an interview at the Fanatics office in New York. (Actually, he and Mr. Kraft like to FaceTime each other.)","They were set up on a friend date in 2012 by Mr. Kraft’s oldest son, Jonathan Kraft, the president of the Kraft Group and the New England Patriots. Mr. Rubin was divorced, and so they were two single men with 10-digit bank accounts. ","“I’ll go as his date to events, he’ll come as my date,” Mr. Rubin said. “My girlfriend is jealous. She’ll say, ‘I wish you talked to me the way you talk to Robert.’”","In Charlotte, N.C., during last month’s N.B.A. All-Star weekend, Mr. Rubin chatted with an N.B.A. employee who revealed that he was a die-hard Patriots fan. “So I FaceTime Robert,” Mr. Rubin said, “he’s got his shirt off, he’s in bed. I say to the kid, ‘Say hi to Robert,’ and then I leave the phone.”","Mr. Rubin is trying to keep Mr. Kraft hip to pop culture, but some references get lost. In February, Mr. Rubin was at a 76ers game with the actress Emily Ratajkowski and her husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard, a producer, and Josh Ostrovsky, the Instagram personality known as the Fat Jew. ",Mr. Rubin FaceTimed Mr. Kraft and introduced him to Mr. Ostrovsky. Mr. Kraft was perplexed. “What do you mean he’s a fat Jew?” he said. ,Mr. Kraft and Meek Mill first bonded through Mr. Rubin during a guys’ weekend in Miami to attend the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.,"“I am from the ghettos of America, and he is one of the most powerful billionaires,” said Meek Mill of Mr. Kraft. “He is more down-to-earth and relatable than I expected him to be.” ","After the Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl, in February, Meek Mill gave Mr. Kraft his $200,000 diamond-encrusted necklace that spells out “Championships,” the title of his recent album. Mr. Kraft wore it during the victory parade. ","“My chain is like my Super Bowl trophy for rising above poverty and overcoming the system,” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘I wear this chain every day. It’s my gift to you.’”",Meek Mill said he had spoken to Mr. Kraft probably 30 times since the massage parlor scandal broke. ,"In 2017, Meek Mill, now 31, was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating his parole. (Meek Mill pleaded not guilty to the initial incident, when he was 19, and said if he had done what he was accused of, he would be dead. “Everyone knows what happens to a black kid that points a gun at police officers,” he said.)","Meek Mill’s friends, including Mr. Kraft, talked to him frequently while he was in prison and were outraged by his situation. Mr. Kraft visited him in prison a year ago and spoke to the press about injustice afterward.","The N.F.L.’s inner circle is dominated by billionaires who lean to the right. Despite his friendship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kraft is considered one of the more liberal owners, backing an array of progressive causes and voting Democratic more often than not.","“He is one of the biggest faces in America, and this is a smart guy saying to the world, ‘This is a good kid.’” Meek Mill said. “It was a big deal for me.”","After Meek Mill was released, Mr. Rubin asked Mr. Kraft to join his efforts to create an organization called Reform Alliance, to fight for changes to criminal justice practices. The eight founders, including Jay-Z and Daniel Loeb, a billionaire investor, pledged a combined $50 million.","Meek Mill sees echoes of his experiences in Mr. Kraft’s current predicament. “They aligned his name with a different set of charges that weren’t tied to him at all,” he said.","There are big differences, and Meek Mill has made sure Mr. Kraft appreciates them too. “I said it to Robert the other day, ‘Someone as powerful as you, you have done so much good in the world and brung so much to America, you see what they did to you,’” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘Imagine someone that comes from poverty in the ghetto who doesn’t have people to speak up for them on their behalf. It happens in my community every day.’”","Mr. Kraft grew up in Brookline, Mass., loving sports, though joining teams was difficult because he couldn’t play on the Sabbath. He liked the Boston Braves baseball team.","He went to college at Columbia, on scholarship. As a senior, he went back to Boston for a football game and spotted Myra Hiatt in a delicatessen. He waited until her date went to the restroom and then introduced himself. He went to the library on the Brandeis campus the next day to look her up, and they married the following year.","Myra finished college, and they had four sons; three work for the family business. ","After attending Harvard Business School, Mr. Kraft went to work for his father-in-law. Mr. Kraft had his own vision for the company, and left but eventually purchased the business and began to build a fortune in paper and packaging. As he did, he and Mrs. Kraft established themselves as a power couple in Boston’s charity scene. The family has given away “hundreds of millions of dollars,” a Patriots spokesman said.","Foundations backed by Mr. Kraft are known to make unexpected calls to small organizations in which Mr. Kraft pledges a gift ranging from $100,000 to a few million dollars, urging the nonprofit group to create donor-match campaigns.","A few years ago, Lisa Goldblatt Grace, a founder of My Life My Choice, received such a call, from an executive at the Patriots Foundation. The mission of My Life My Choice is to support young survivors of sexual exploitation and the commercial sex industry. The foundation gave the group $100,000, with a matching incentive. The money allowed the group to hire another mentor, Ms. Grace said.","“We were heartbroken when we heard the news that Robert Kraft had been charged,” Ms. Grace said. “The most important thing we can do is focus on the victims and shine a light that helps people to understand that this is a multi-billion-dollar industry that preys on the most vulnerable.”","In 1994, Mr. Kraft paid $172 million for the Patriots, at the time the largest sum paid for a professional sports franchise. ",Mr. Kraft and his son Jonathan flew back from the meeting to Boston (middle seats in coach on T.W.A.) to tell Mrs. Kraft the deal was done. She was worried that the high price tag would make it difficult for the family to continue its philanthropy. Mr. Kraft promised her that owning an N.F.L. team would give them an even larger platform to support their causes.,"The next night, Mrs. Kraft overheard her husband on the phone with the head coach, Bill Parcells. Mr. Parcells said he needed $10 million for a contract to sign a player.","She was not happy. “The summer house better be in my name,” she told him.","The investment turned out to be beyond sound. In 2000 Mr. Kraft lured Bill Belichick away from the Patriots’ division rival New York Jets. The next year, Mr. Brady became the team’s starting quarterback, and the Patriots raced all the way to their first Super Bowl win.","The Belichick-Brady tandem has shattered records ever since. Forbes estimates that the Patriots are the second-most-valuable N.F.L. franchise, worth an estimated $3.8 billion.","The team’s success has also burnished Mr. Kraft’s status inside the N.F.L., where owners can be hypercompetitive and jealous. By most accounts, Mr. Kraft has become the league’s most influential owner, with seats on the powerful broadcasting, labor and finance committees. ","His contacts in media circles make him indispensable during negotiations with the television networks that provide the bulk of the league’s income. One owner said that these multi-billion-dollar deals are typically negotiated by three people: the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell; Brian Rolapp, the league’s media chief; and Mr. Kraft.","Now, amid what friends describe as Mr. Kraft’s unyielding anguish over his travails and the uncertainties he is confronting in the legal system, the N.F.L. and the court of public opinion, Mr. Kraft’s BFFs are rallying around him, and are eager to discuss the depth of their respect.","Despite the solicitation charges, Mr. Trump has said he wants Mr. Kraft to attend a White House reception celebrating the Patriots’ recent Super Bowl victory.","Mr. Brady is also standing by his longtime friend. “I’ve been with the organization 19 years and I’ve been through a lot,” Mr. Brady said. “He has been by me and supported me. That’s hard to do these days — to have longtime relationships like we do is a challenge.” ","Mr. Bledsoe, the former Patriots quarterback, said that even in the 18 years since he left the team, he still answers his mobile phone when the caller ID says “BLOCKED,” in case it’s Mr. Kraft, whom he calls “RKK.” ","“RKK has achieved success on a scale that few people ever achieved and kept his soul intact all the way through,” said Mr. Bledsoe, now a winemaker in Walla Walla, Wash. ","On a golf outing a few years ago, Mr. Bledsoe asked Mr. Kraft to tell him the one thing that matters most in building a successful organization. “‘There is no one thing,’” Mr. Bledsoe said he said. “‘There are no small details.’”","Kenny Chesney, the country music star, said: “Robert has become in many ways a very strong mentor in my life. He believes that music and sports bring people together like nothing else.”","Fifteen years ago, Mr. Chesney was dreaming of performing concerts in N.F.L. stadiums, which hold three to four times more fans than other large arenas. “Robert was the first N.F.L. owner to take a chance on a guy from East Tennessee,” Mr. Chesney said. ","He has played Gillette Stadium, home of the Patriots, in Foxborough, Mass., 19 times, more than any other musical artist. He has lunch with Mr. Kraft in his office each time he plays there.","“He set me on a path and helped me see a blueprint for how to change the scale of my business and the scope of my touring life,” Mr. Chesney said.","Mr. Kraft has made only a few public appearances since he was charged, including at parties hosted by fellow billionaires Ron Perelman and Barry Diller on Oscar weekend in Los Angeles.",Mr. Rubin called Mr. Kraft and urged him to come to Philadelphia for Meek Mill’s first hometown solo concert since being released from prison last year. ,"On March 15, Mr. Kraft hung out backstage while Meek Mill performed at the Met Philadelphia, a recently refurbished opera house.

"To Build a Champion, the Rams Took Risks. They Just Don’t See It That Way. - The New York Times",ATLANTA — Marcus Peters came into this week well aware of the narrative that had developed around himself and the other defensive starters the Los Angeles Rams had acquired since last season.,"“What you’re trying to say is, how does he take a bunch of guys who have bad reps and make them act cool together?” he replied when asked how Coach Sean McVay and his assistants handled the acquisitions of Aqib Talib, Ndamukong Suh, Dante Fowler and Peters.","They all have run into trouble on or off the field. So Peters, on guard for any intent to trash the reputations of the Rams newcomers, considered the question before continuing. ","“I got a coach who just turned 33, he does an excellent job with us,” he said. “I think that us as a team, we’ve been doing a hell of a job by respecting each other, and it’s been all together with ‘we, not me.’”","That spirit of camaraderie is evident up and down the roster heading into Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots on Sunday. The entire team talks about the value of liking one another, the comfort they have with the coaching staff. They frequently praise the work of General Manager Les Snead, who drastically reworked the defense in a series of moves last off-season — and one significant trade during the season — that helped turn the Rams from last season’s breakout team to this season’s N.F.C. champion.","Snead faced equal doses of praise and criticism as he pieced together a defense that he hoped could better complement a world-beating offense. Talib and Fowler have been involved in off-field misconduct cases. Suh had long been saddled with a reputation as a dirty player. Peters, a 26-year-old big-play cornerback, had been dismissed from his team in college and made available by the Kansas City Chiefs for a trade because of personality conflicts and some heated arguments with coaches.","At the time of the trade last February, Peters made a point of mentioning that all of his issues in the past had been related to intensity on the field and that his off-field record was unblemished.","Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ executive vice president for football operations, said his team was not given enough credit for due diligence before trading for Peters and the others. ","“We did a ton of research on each of these guys individually,” Demoff said. “It wasn’t like we opened up NFL.com’s Top-10 N.F.L. Free Agents and said, ‘yes, yes, yes, no.’”","Demoff said an important element of the decision was trusting the culture created by McVay and his defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips.","“I think we thought that not only could our coaching staff and the organization handle it,” Demoff said, “but that it was probably a lot less of a risk than people made it out to be.”","Phillips, who had coached Talib to a Super Bowl title with the Denver Broncos, said his approach when trying to bring together players of various personalities was fairly straightforward.","“You ask them to do what you want them to do, you let them know clearly how you want it done, and if they’re not doing it, you tell them,” he said. “As long as you’re truthful with these guys, they can trust you.”","Talib said that Phillips was a master of letting players be themselves, but added that it was not hard to come together, because Snead and the team’s other executives had done such a good job at finding players that would fit together.","“Kudos to Les,” he said. “Les went out and got the perfect group of guys that could get in the locker room and mesh together.”","In the regular season, the results were mixed for the Rams’ attempt at building a championship-caliber defense. The unit ranked 19th in yards allowed and 20th in average points allowed per game (Los Angeles had ranked 12th and 19th in those categories last season). Its biggest successes were the interior pressure created by Aaron Donald, who is expected to repeat as the N.F.L.’s Defensive Player of the Year, and 30 turnovers, which ranked third in the N.F.L.","The problems consisted of a propensity to allow big plays, a softness in their run defense, and an injury that cost Talib, an 11-year veteran, eight games and left the team too short-handed to compete. Peters showed flashes of brilliance, but in eight games without Talib, the Rams allowed an average of 30.6 points a game. In the 10 games, including the playoffs, that Talib started, that number was 18.3.","In the postseason, the whole group has seemingly been at its best. ","Suh and Fowler appear rejuvenated, generating a combined three sacks, and Talib and Peters took the best shots Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys and Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints had to offer and walked away victorious both times — even after you account for the missed pass-interference call on Nickell Robey-Coleman that has continued to be an issue for the league.","Peters, who was called out by Saints Coach Sean Payton for ineffective play in the Rams’ loss to New Orleans in Week 9, approached Payton after the conference championship, presumably to remind him of those unkind words."," Proving Peters’s point about how narratives can be twisted, some news media described the encounter as Peters trying to fight Payton, despite video showing that the cornerback was just talking.","Now that he is with the Rams, Peters has found a team willing to look beyond a headline and find out what’s really going on. And if Los Angeles can come away with a win on Sunday, Peters, doubted by so many, will undoubtedly have plenty more to say."
"In Adam Gase, Jets Pick a Coach They Could Rarely Beat - The New York Times","The Jets have come to the realization that if they could not beat Adam Gase, they might as well hire him.","After a busy, 10-day coaching search that saw the team chairman Christopher Johnson and General Manager Mike Maccagnan interview eight candidates, the Jets decided on Wednesday to name Gase their next head coach, according to a person familiar with the deal who is not authorized to comment publicly about it.","The hire was first reported by ESPN and NFL Network, and a formal announcement is expected to come on Thursday.","Gase went 23-25 in three seasons with the Miami Dolphins in the A.F.C. East, reaching the postseason in just one of those years. But he was 5-1 against the Jets, including two wins in 2018.","It is a pivotal hire for the franchise, which fired Todd Bowles on Dec. 30 after four playoff-less seasons that extended a postseason drought that started in 2011. But in quarterback Sam Darnold, who will be entering his sophomore season, the team believes it has a franchise cornerstone brimming with potential.","Gase, 40, checked a lot of boxes for Johnson and Maccagnan, who led the search. He is a young but experienced coach with a reputation as an innovative playcaller. Most important for his new team, he is a quarterback guru, who received rave reviews for his work with players including Peyton Manning, Jay Cutler, and Tim Tebow — work that the Jets hope will continue with Darnold.","Gase was considered a rising star in 2016, when he was hired by Miami as the youngest coach in the N.F.L. He had spent two seasons as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos, who set N.F.L. scoring records and reached the Super Bowl with his creative, pass-heavy offense. As the Chicago Bears’ offensive coordinator in 2015, he helped Cutler reduce his interceptions and record a career-best passer rating.","His breakthrough into head coaching, however, came with mixed results. Gase, who also called the plays for Miami, went 10-6 his first season and reached the playoffs — losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in a wild-card game — but the team failed to finish over .500 the next two years. Gase’s young quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, missed the entire 2017 season and five games in 2018. And with an injury-depleted roster this season, Gase received some credit for managing to keep the team in contention until the final month of the season.","A protégé of Nick Saban, Gase did not play college football but started assisting on Saban’s staff as a student at Michigan State. When Saban later left for Louisiana State, Gase was the only staff member who left with him. And during the week leading up to the Super Bowl in 2014, Manning called Gase “the smartest guy I know.”","Gase’s hiring caps a coaching search that carried a palpable sense of urgency. On Dec. 31, a day after the conclusion of the regular season, Johnson and Maccagnan outlined what they were looking for in the next coach, knowing that seven other teams were in the same boat. And the Jets quickly got to interviewing; the candidates included the former head coaches Jim Caldwell and Mike McCarthy; the coordinators Eric Bieniemy, Todd Monken, and Kris Richard; and the Baylor University coach Matt Rhule.",Gase’s résumé stands out among those of past Jets coaches. He is the franchise’s first coach to be hired with any prior head coaching experience since Bill Parcells in 1997 and the first with an offensive background since Rich Kotite in 1995.,"While Johnson and Maccagnan did not rule out hiring another defense-minded coach, their remarks made clear that they were focused on finding someone who could mentor Darnold, the No. 3 overall pick in last year’s draft. And with the No. 3 pick yet again this year, and over $100 million in salary cap space this off-season, the burden is on Maccagnan, in the final year of his contract, to put together a roster that can finally compete for a division title.","On Dec. 31, Johnson said he believed the Jets’ opening was an attractive one, and not only because of Darnold.","“If you win here, you’re a freaking legend,” Johnson said. “That counts for something.”",Gase will get the chance to find out.

Defense Sustained the Patriots’ Reign Until the Old Guard Rose - The New York Times,"After the first series in Sunday’s Super Bowl, which ended in an interception, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady angrily cocked his right arm and flung his helmet over a sideline bench.","Behind him, Coach Bill Belichick was yelling in the direction of two assistants, who did not bother to turn around.","On the field, Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower had a potential interception ricochet off his hands.","Brady went back out for the Patriots’ next offensive series of the first quarter and swiftly moved them into scoring position, but Stephen Gostkowski missed a field goal, the first kick he had missed in five games. Watching near his team bench, Brady turned and hurled a wad of white tape to the ground.","The Patriots were having one of the ugliest performances of any of their nine Super Bowls in the Belichick era, and that included the three games they lost. Yes, the Los Angeles Rams were falling apart, seemingly trying to give the game away. But the Patriots had not run away from the confused, tentative Rams. And they were still tied with them in the fourth quarter.","But then, like so many other times before, when it counted most, Brady and the Patriots rediscovered the brilliance that produced five previous Super Bowl victories. An offense once out of sync found a groove that led to a sparkling touchdown drive.","It was brief, but it had the cool efficacy of an assassin. The names so familiar. Edelman. Gronkowski. Sony Michel. And the Patriots’ defense, which was not even ranked in the top half of the N.F.L. this season, somehow kept the league’s second-ranked offense from scoring a touchdown.","Seconds before the final whistle and a last, largely ceremonial play, the Patriots began hugging one another in the huddle. Seconds later, confetti showered the field and the Patriots were 13-3 winners.","The struggles of the first three quarters were forgotten, a puzzling memory but of no consequence any longer.","“It was tough,” Brady said on the field afterward. “We just couldn’t make the big play; we couldn’t stay on the field on third down. It was a weird game like that. We were doing so much right, but none of it mattered until the fourth quarter.”","It was, in many ways, a microcosm of the Patriots’ season. They began the year 1-2, rallied and then fell apart again. But they made the playoffs, capping their run with their sixth Super Bowl win — tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most. They did so by outplaying three of the top teams in the league: the Los Angeles Chargers, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Rams, who could never figure out how to solve New England’s ’ ever-changing defense.","The Patriots left their safeties deep for much of the game but kept switching the positions of their cornerbacks, keeping them in the Rams’ wide receivers’ faces on one series, and then backing off the next. And the pressure on Rams quarterback Jared Goff was relentless for much of the night.","A sloppy, listless game like Sunday’s might make it hard to immediately declare the Patriots’ championship run this century as one of the best in N.F.L. history, but the resilience and the ability to come out on top year after year is hard to argue with.","“It took all kinds of ways to get this done, even week by week,” Brady said. “We had to grind it out against the Chargers, at Kansas City and obviously again tonight when we really struggled to find a rhythm.","“But I mean, world champs again. Man, it’s pretty unreal.”","The tone of the game — chaotic, muddled, boring — was evident from the beginning. The Patriots were having their problems, but the Rams’ offense was hapless (they had just two first downs in the first half).",The Patriots were marching but getting nowhere.,"There was one Patriot having a spectacular game: wide receiver Julian Edelman, who had 10 receptions for 141 yards and was named game’s most valuable player. In the first half alone, Edelman made six catches that resulted in a first down, including a 25-yarder that set up a 42-yard Gostkowski field goal and a 3-0 lead that lasted until intermission. The Rams tied the game with a field goal of their own in the third quarter.","The pivotal drive of the game began when the Patriots took control of the ball with 8 minutes 50 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The first play of the possession was a nice touch pass from Brady, who lofted the football over the head of a defender as tight end Rob Gronkowski circled toward the sideline for 18 yards.","Two more Brady completions had the crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium chanting, “Bray-dee!”","Brady then settled in the pocket and, behind the near flawless pass protection he had throughout the game, lofted a perfect spiral that dropped over the head of two fleet Rams defenders who were nonetheless helplessly chasing the 6-foot-6, 270-pound Gronkowski.","Gronkowski was hobbled for most of this season, sometimes comically so, and he is openly pondering retirement. But after two weeks to rest various leg and elbow infirmities, Gronkowski looked rejuvenated. His 26-yard catch moved the ball to the Rams’ 2.","In the huddle before the play, Edelman looked at Gronkowski and said, “We need another one from you, bro, we need a huge play.”","Gronkowski said, “He had been making all the plays; I had to step up.”","On the next play, Michel bulled into the end zone for a 10-3 lead. A late Gostkowski field goal sealed the outcome.","The Patriots, bungling, frustrated and unsure of themselves for most of the game, had found a way to another championship — as they have so often before.","“I don’t know what was going on there for a while — it was strange,” Brady said. “I just know it doesn’t matter anymore.”"
Crucial Reference Helped Adam Gase Land Jets Job: Peyton Manning - The New York Times,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Shortly before he was fired by the Miami Dolphins, Adam Gase requested a favor from one of his former pupils. He knew he would need some help convincing another team to take a chance on him so quickly after a disappointing three years as head coach of the Dolphins. Fortunately, a powerful voice was willing to intercede: Peyton Manning.","It has been five years since Manning and Gase first joined forces in Denver, setting records and bringing the Broncos to a Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium. But a phone call last week from Manning to the Jets’ chairman and chief executive, Christopher Johnson, went a long way for Gase, who will find himself back at MetLife in a different capacity this fall.","On Monday, at Gase’s introductory news conference as the Jets’ new head coach, Johnson signaled a shift in the organization’s philosophy, which has centered on defense for the past two decades. With Gase, the Jets have finally stepped in line with the league’s curve.","“To paraphrase Wayne Gretzky,” Johnson said, “he’s coaching to where football is going.”","There was some inherent awkwardness as Gase arrived in front of a packed auditorium filled with team executives, former players, and fans. As coach of the Dolphins, he went 5-1 against the Jets, including two wins this season. And since the deal was announced last week, reports have surfaced indicating that talks had broken down between the Jets and another top candidate, Matt Rhule, over staffing issues, although Johnson denied on Monday that the team intended to dictate any staff hires.","But Gase, 40, underscored his reputation for fieriness and an inimitable work ethic by expressing how eager he was to get back to coaching despite only having been out of a job for a little more than a week.","“I was home for nine days, and I was good,” Gase joked.","He had a pedestrian 23-25 record with Miami, his first head coaching stint, and some players were critical of his style in exit interviews after the season. But the Jets were willing to look at his new situation as a fresh start in several ways.","“We have a young team,” General Manager Mike Maccagnan said. “We have a lot of cap space. We have a lot of roster flexibility — we’re not burdened by a lot of big contracts and older players.”","These factors, Maccagnan continued, provide “an ability to shift and change a little bit.”","He added, “We can change the makeup of our team pretty quickly.”","The Jets have more than $100 million cap space, which Gase acknowledged made them an especially intriguing landing spot. He also said he liked the ability to stay in the A.F.C. East and get another crack at dethroning the New England Patriots.","But Gase said the primary factor in his decision to sign with the team was Sam Darnold, the 21-year-old quarterback who will be entering his second season after showing plenty of promise as a rookie. Gase took Manning to new heights at the end of his career, and he guided Tim Tebow and Jay Cutler as well (he was a bit less successful developing Ryan Tannehill, his quarterback in Miami, though Tannehill missed the entire 2017 season and some of 2018 as well).",But he said he has never worked with a talent like Darnold.,"“This is the first time I’ve been able to get with a guy this young, this early in his career,” Gase said. “He’s hungry for knowledge, he wants to be coached. And with a player that does have the physical traits, this is an exciting thing for me to go through.”","The Jets interviewed Gase early on, but then followed up with a second interview that included Darnold, who chimed in via FaceTime. Johnson had said he would look for a coach that had success grooming young quarterbacks; Gase’s résumé checked out.","Though he was hesitant to reveal many details about who he wants to fill his coaching staff, Gase said that he was considering forgoing hiring a quarterback coach, so as not to fill Darnold’s head with too many voices besides that of his offensive coordinator and Gase himself. (Gase also called the plays in Miami.)","With Manning, Gase said, it took almost no time to develop a kinship.","“When we met each other, it was really, ‘Who’s going to be the first one to break, who will outwork who?’” Gase said. “He appreciates hard work, and who’s going to go nose-to-nose with him and mentally try to challenge each other. That was something I really enjoyed.”",The Jets are betting that their matchmaker game between Darnold and Gase produces something similar.,"“You always want to be forward-looking,” Johnson said. “The game is changing. Adam has shown us that he is part of that change.”"
Pochettino Fears VAR Will Change 'Spirit' of Game - The New York Times,"LONDON — Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino fears the ""spirit of football"" is being changed by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) after his side fell victim to technology on Tuesday.",As it turned out the penalty awarded by VAR against Danny Rose for handball was missed by Sergio Aguero and Tottenham went on to earn a crucial 1-0 win in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at their new ground.,But that could not hide Pochettino's unease at a system that will be rolled out in the Premier League next season.,"While a sliding Rose's arm did make contact with the ball as he attempted to block Raheem Sterling's shot, no City player appealed for a penalty - evidence in itself that the decision was the kind of marginal one that could be debated all night.","Pochettino himself said in the letter of the law it could possibly have been a penalty, but rules on what constitutes handball appear open to interpretation.","As it stands in the International Football Association Board (IFAB) rulebook, a player can be penalised for handball if their arms extend 'beyond a natural silhouette' - even if accidental.",Manchester United beat Paris St Germain thanks to a late VAR penalty this season after Diogo Dalot's shot struck Presnel Kimpembe on the arm and went over the crossbar - a decision Neymar branded a 'disgrace'.,"Pochettino was more measured, perhaps as the penalty was saved by Hugo Lloris, but still raised concerns that there are too many grey areas in deciding on handball.","""There's a lot of work to do with VAR,"" he told reporters. ""We know there are many decisions that no one knows if VAR is going to be used or not, to check or not.","""Maybe technically it was a penalty because it was handball, but we do not know the protocol.

Is it going to check everything?"" Pochettino said.","""I don't know because today there were a lot of actions you could check. Next season, how is it going to work?

"In Soccer, Power’s Always in Play - The New York Times","PARIS — On the pitch, soccer is a cipher for war, with uniforms, formations, victory and defeat. Beyond the pitch, soccer is power, with owners seemingly using their teams as much for the corollary benefits as for any love of the game.","Sports in general, but especially soccer — given its global appeal — are an ideal way for tycoons to purchase prestige and for countries to burnish their reputations, particularly when governments have unsavory associations with issues such as human rights abuse, gender inequality or antidemocratic politics.","“Soccer and the Arab World: The Revolution of the Round Ball,” an exhibition at the Arab World Institute in Paris that runs through July 21, surveys the modern history of the sport in Africa and the Middle East, charting changes in gender and racial politics, government and finance, through the lens of the game.","Viewing the Arab world from the French perspective, the show ranges from midcentury events like the rise of the first Algerian national team, whose players broke away from France even though Algeria was still a colony, to more recent ones, like the purchase in 2011 of the French soccer team, Paris St.-Germain, by a Qatari state-run company.","Binding the show together is an exploration of political clout: using soccer to explore the increasing reach of some Arab nations, while France’s global influence is decreasing — seen in the cultural legitimacy that the sport provides.","“New Arab countries are in the game,” said the show’s curator, Aurélie Clemente-Ruiz, on a recent tour of the exhibition. “It’s not only North Africa or the Middle East but all of these countries from the Arabian Peninsula — Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates — that are very involved in soccer, and it’s a way for them to exist in an international point of view. It’s a real soft power and, to them, very useful.”","At the root is the ability of sports to shape perceptions. For the likes of Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,  being associated with global soccer can help divert attention from the international indignation at the killing of a dissident. For Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates, his ownership and lavish spending on the English team Manchester City automatically buys a certain fame and influence. Similar reasons inform Qatar’s control of Paris St.-Germain and the country’s efforts to win the right to host the men’s World Cup in 2022.","The exhibition begins by looking at how soccer reflected relations between France and Arab nations over nearly a century, including in former French colonies: It touches on the Nejmeh Sporting Club in Lebanon, a team historically known for its players’ mixed ethnicities; and on Larbi Benbarek, a Moroccan midfielder born in Casablanca who played for the French national team and is regarded as the first great Arab soccer player in Europe. (When Morocco won its independence in 1956, Mr. Benbarek became the national team’s first coach.)","The show in Paris also focuses on soccer as a way for people on the outskirts of society to gain mainstream recognition: It explores the rise of Arab women’s teams and the shifting views on race in France between the country’s World Cup victories in 1998 and 2018. Ms. Clemente-Ruiz said that the de facto slogan of the 1998 French national team, “black-blanc-beur,” or “black-white-Arab,” gave way in 2018 to “blue-white-red,” the colors of the French flag. She said the implication was that the French players were no longer defined by skin color but by their shared nationality.","“Soccer is the first place many people will begin to accept immigration, to see those of other colors as one of their own,” Ms. Clemente-Ruiz said.","Given the subject matter, at least one of the exhibition’s backers was of interest: Qatar’s tourist board is an official sponsor. So are FIFA and the French Football Federation, which lent a number of archival objects to the exhibition, including both of France’s World Cup trophies. (A private Lebanese collection also provided numerous loans, including the oldest known photographs of Arabs playing soccer, from 1929.)","The show does not kowtow to the sponsors, however. In fact, sometimes it borders on mocking Qatari influence on soccer. In the penultimate room of the exhibition, the uniforms of Paris St.-Germain’s superstars, including Edinson Cavani, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar, are studded with fake jewels, the usual dark blues and blacks of the jerseys transformed into shocks of outlandish rainbow colors. Created by the Indian designer Manish Malhotra, known for costume design in Bollywood films, the outfits drip with nouveau-riche taste. Here, soccer is about the confluence of money, prestige, and a polished global image.","Jack Lang, the president of the Arab World Institute and a former culture minister of France, said in an interview that he conceived of the exhibition in 2016 as way to expand the institute’s sometimes-narrow focus on North Africa and its relationship to France. Ms. Clemente-Ruiz said that she had been committed to maintaining political neutrality, presenting the facts of Arab influence on soccer while withholding any significant judgments.","Yet there are times when the exhibition does take a political side, such as a section on the Palestinian national team that is penned in by high, metal fences, or in a room of eight models of Qatar’s World Cup stadiums, which feature no mention of complaints about working conditions for the thousands of migrant workers who built them.","The show is composed mostly of documents, videos, archival photographs and objects, but there are some artworks, too. One of them, a two-channel video installation, follows Zinedine Zidane, a French former midfielder of Algerian descent, as he plays for Real Madrid in a 2005 match against Villarreal — a study of near-monastic focus and intensity. Splicing together footage from 17 cameras trained on the player, “Zidane, a 21st Century Portrait,” created by Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno, is a worshipful portrait of one of the most talented French players of all time, ultimately placing an Arab-descended individual at the center of French history and celebrity.","The video brings a spiritual aspect to a sport that is increasingly defined by money and politics. Mr. Zidane was a player whose rare talent largely kept him from being used as a political pawn, the child of immigrants who moved to France while Algeria was under colonial rule. After the World Cup win in 1998, Jacques Chirac, then the president of France, called him a man that “the whole country is extremely proud of.”","Mr. Zidane’s influence binds past and present, transcending the tensions between the Arab world and France, and epitomizing the possibilities that soccer presents."
Robert Kraft’s Other Problem: Soccer - The New York Times,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Robert K. Kraft’s New England Patriots are a very good football team, having won six Super Bowl championships the past 19 years. They are 33-5 against the A.F.C. East division rival Buffalo Bills during that span.","In a cruel twist of fate, Robert Kraft’s other team that plays at Gillette Stadium, the New England Revolution, might as well be the Buffalo Bills of Major League Soccer. There was a run of dominance — four M.L.S. Cup Finals appearances in six years — without a championship, and a mostly fallow period now going on a decade. The team is below .500 (125-148-89) since 2008, the year after it went to its third straight M.L.S. Cup Finals.","Kraft has bigger concerns at the moment than the Revolution. He is facing two misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. (Kraft denies illegal activity.) Kraft most likely won’t face jail time, but the charges could result in a fine or a suspension or both from the National Football League, where he has become one of the most powerful owners, and from Major League Soccer, where he also enjoys a long, close relationship with the commissioner.","If his attention turns back to his soccer team, he is likely to find a house in the middle of a major overhaul.","“One of our strategies last year was to instill a new culture at the club,” said Brad Friedel, the former United States national team goalkeeper hired to turn around the team last year. He said a tear-down had been necessary. “We felt that there needed to be a completely different work ethic.”","Friedel spoke before the Revolution’s home opener last weekend, a 2-0 loss to the Columbus Crew. He praised his team’s recent signings, but he didn’t hesitate to criticize the team he took over. “We needed leaders,” he said. “We didn’t have a lot of leaders last year.”",There is no Tom Brady here.,"The Revolution began play in 1996, as one of Major League Soccer’s 10 original teams. Kraft, alongside Lamar Hunt and Philip Anschutz, recruited Don Garber from the N.F.L. to be the league’s commissioner, and that tight group helped keep M.L.S. afloat in the early 2000s, when it was on the verge of collapse.","But while Kraft has been able to master the N.F.L., the soccer revolution in America has mostly passed him by.","The Revolution are one of three M.L.S. teams that still play in cavernous football stadiums. The others, Atlanta United and the Seattle Sounders, justify it by drawing the largest average attendance figures in the league, but only 13,808 fans showed up for the Revolution’s home opener last weekend. The Revolution will draw better when there isn’t snow on the ground, of course, but last year’s average attendance ranked 16th in the league.","The team has been trying to build a soccer-specific stadium somewhere in the Boston area since 2006. In the 13 years since, sites have been proposed, millions have been spent on architectural renderings, and plots of land have almost been purchased, all to eventually collapse for one reason or another. A new multimillion-dollar training center will open this season, but that too will be in Foxborough, even as the Boston stadium search goes on.","“It’s about getting into a stadium that will transform soccer in our region,” the team president, Brian Bilello, said. “With that in mind, we have been patient, probably to a fault, to try and get the right project done.”","In Garber’s mind, most of the Revolution’s problems would be fixed by a new stadium. “My view is their economic model is challenging in Gillette,” he said. “It has not been able to tap into the young, millennial sports fan in the Boston metropolitan area because it is further away.”",The couple hundred die-hard Revolution fans tailgating in the parking lot before the home opener weren’t so sure. The stadium search has gone on for so long that they rarely get their hopes up anymore. A number of them said that it feels as if the Revolution are a distant priority for the Krafts.,"Bilello and Garber deny that is the case. Still, the N.F.L. is a $15 billion-a-year league, and a social, financial and cultural presence far bigger than M.L.S. Kraft sits on some of the N.F.L.’s most powerful committees. His son, Jonathan Kraft, holds those roles on M.L.S. committees and seems to handle most of the team’s day-to-day business.","Last year, the Krafts spent $20 million to buy their third team, the Boston Uprising, an e-sports team that competes in the Overwatch League. The sardonic joke among some Revolution supporters is that now they’re not even the neglected second child, but something even worse: the ignored middle child.",The team declined to make either Robert or Jonathan Kraft available for this article.,"Over the years, the Revolution have dabbled in signing higher-priced players, but none has proved a particularly large draw or game-changing addition on the field. The team now wants to give young homegrown players, like Isaac Angking, Nicolas Firmino and Justin Rennicks, a real pathway to first team minutes and success.","This off-season, the team also acquired Carles Gil, a Spanish midfielder Friedel hopes will jump-start the attack, along with other players who figure to make an impact, like Edgar Castillo and Juan Fernando Caicedo. Bilello said that the team’s spending on players had been ramping up and that the Krafts were giving the team all the money it needed to compete; both Bilello and Friedel promised that another designated player — the league’s highest salary classification — would arrive in either May or July, once contractual issues could be worked out. They would not reveal the player’s identity.","The team is also building a new $35 million training center adjacent to Gillette Stadium that will house both the first team and the academy. The center will feature a number of grass and artificial turf training pitches — the team’s current training pitch is covered in snow, so it has been practicing at Gillette Stadium — and the state-of-the-art facilities that, team officials hope, will help persuade new players to join.","Soccer is soccer, though, and building a winning team is mostly the same the world over. The thing that makes M.L.S. unique, according to Friedel, who spent nearly two decades playing in England and other top European leagues, is that it is constantly evolving.","“Whether there is a new rule, a new stadium, a new training ground, other new designated players, a new club, a new franchise, a new second division, a new third division,” he said, ticking off the list of possibilities, “all these things happened in this country because the league is growing.”","The last four M.L.S. Cups have been won by teams that weren’t original league members, and the last few years have witnessed a steady expansion of the league. When M.L.S. fans think of the most exciting teams now, they are often thinking of bright new teams with bright new stadiums with bright young stars, clubs like Atlanta United and Los Angeles F.C.","“At times it is easier to be new, and it is easier to be a new and improved, than it is to be a legacy business,” Garber said.","In New England, they know how true this is."
Finding Fraternity and Politics in Algerian Soccer - The New York Times,Arms raised high. Crowds united in song. Riot police armed with batons. These images could have been taken at political rallies or protests. But they weren’t. They were from soccer matches in northwestern Algeria.,"The sport is so popular in the North African nation and the region, that it’s been given the Marxist treatment: “We call it the opium of the people,” Fethi Sahraoui said. Since 2015, Mr. Sahraoui has photographed roughly 30 games in his hometown, Mascara, and in neighboring Relizane. The result is “Stadiumphilia.”","During soccer season — which runs from late August until the end of May — young men storm stadiums to watch local teams face off in biweekly matches. Unlike those fans, Mr. Sahraoui isn’t concerned with the athletes. He turns his lens toward the surrounding commotion, the fervent faces in the stands.","The atmosphere is electric, to say the least. Algerian law prohibits anyone under 18 to enter the stadiums without a guardian, Mr. Sahraoui said. But that doesn’t stop young boys from trying to jump over fences to see the action.","On the surface, the takeaway is that Algerians are soccer fanatics. But Mr. Sahraoui sees beyond the entertainment. He says the stadiums have become platforms for young men to find a sense of brotherhood and to escape the pressures of daily life. After spending years among those crowds, he adds, he can’t help but link the energy of those games to current protests.","In February, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced that he would run for a fifth term. Algerians had been living under his rule for 20 years, and they had had enough. Thousands of demonstrators have been taking to the streets demanding his resignation, citing problems like corruption and stifling unemployment.","Life is particularly rough for Algerian youth. According to the International Monetary Fund, the unemployment rate among Algerians between the ages of 15 and 24 is more than 28 percent. And a third of youth are either unemployed or not in school. “We need to admit that what’s happening in Algeria, this popular movement or popular uprising, it’s orchestrated mainly by youth,” Mr. Sahraoui said.","He feels that before the protests, young Algerians took out their frustrations in the soccer stadiums. Their songs and chants were highly political and socially conscious: They would imagine better lives or call for local politicians to step down. Some would sing tribute songs to friends who had perished trying to cross the Mediterranean, Mr. Sahroui said.","Politics has long been intertwined with the sport. In one image, a boy peers out from behind a poster of Zougari Taher, a man who died during the Algerian war for independence from France in the 1950s and ’60s. Locals herald Mr. Taher as a martyr, and the stadium in Relizane is named after him.","With the recent protests, Algerians have turned to the streets. “I’m happy for them because it’s a larger space and a lot of people are hearing them and paying attention to them,” Mr. Sahraoui said. The streets also allows for more unity. Women have openly taken part in the demonstrations, while soccer has always been a “manly” sport in the country, Mr. Sahraoui said. He wanted this essay to focus on young fans, and most if not all of those happened to be boys.","Mr. Sahraoui couldn’t exactly see himself in those youngsters. Growing up, his family thought the games were dangerous and prohibited him from going. “Working on this project, it was like a delayed exploration of this universe,” he said. “I went there as a photographer, but there was the young child who was inside me.”","Fun fact: These images — and all of his personal projects — were taken with smartphones. But he says if no one notices, “it’s a good sign.” He feels at ease with the device. Plus, carrying a larger digital camera would have drawn the curiosity of riot police, while a phone helped him blend in with the crowds.","“I think that a photographer will remain a photographer,” he said. “Even with an iPhone.”",Follow @nytimesphoto and @_SaraAridi on Twitter.

Opinion | Athens in Pieces: An Offering to the Soccer Gods - The New York Times,ATHENS — It is about time I told you what I have really been doing here the past few months. It hasn’t all been visits to archaeological sites and meditations on the contemporary relevance of antiquity. Today I’d like to put ancient history on hold for a moment and move from the past right into the present.,"It might be objected that what I have been writing is a series of postcards, perhaps with lots of local color and historical background, but nonetheless a kind of high-end philosophical tourism from famous Athenian locations. Perhaps this can’t be avoided. I am, after all, a foreigner and a temporary resident. And this city’s monuments, with their beauty and historical grandeur, exert a pull like virtually no others. But is there perhaps a better way of connecting with ordinary Athenians, with their habits and routines? Maybe I could get closer to their lives in the vast modern Agora of this metropolis through a common passion. A passion for soccer. And what site could be more ordinary than a pub?","I am a lifelong fan of Liverpool Football Club and spend much more time than I care to confess watching games, reading about soccer, listening to podcasts and watching endless YouTube clips of highlights, news conferences and often rather tedious match analysis. I will talk to any poor soul I can find about my team and about theirs, although I prefer mine. Yet — much to my constant amazement — there exist people in the world who do not care for the beautiful game.","Liverpool were playing the day after I arrived in Athens in early January. I urgently needed to find out where to watch live games because the TV in my apartment was pretty basic. On the morning of match day, I dipped into the internet and discovered a promising-looking Facebook page for “The Pan-Hellenic Liverpool Friends Club.” I sent a message, more in hope than expectation.","Three minutes later, I got a reply: “Good morning m8. You can meet us in the Wee Dram pub. It is a Scottish pub. Ask for John.”","I got there early and asked for John. It was like meeting a long-lost friend. John Skotidas founded the official Liverpool supporters club in 1995 and has been running it ever since with a good deal of organizational skill. It has 1,100 members, and Liverpool are the most popular English team in Greece. I’ve gotten to know John quite well in the time I have been here. He was an aircraft engineer with the Greek Air Force for 27 years, before retiring at age 46 to pursue his other passion, watching and talking about soccer. John even has his own YouTube channel. He became a Liverpool fan after seeing the Beatles on TV when he was a kid in the late 1960s. He just liked the name “Liverpool.” It sounded good. When he was 10 years old, he watched them play for the first time against Newcastle United in the FA Cup final in 1974 and decided to support them. He has been a fan ever since.","I also met a number of other people in the bar on that first day: Scotty, Kris, Spiros (who promotes Bollywood movies in Greece, which are apparently pretty popular) and a bunch of other Greek fans. I watched my first game with them on Jan. 12, Liverpool versus Brighton. It was an edgy match, but with a confident defensive display from us, we won 1-0 (“one-nil”).","Since then, I’ve watched an awful lot of games at the Wee Dram, and it has developed into a ritual of sorts. I have a talked a fair bit about the nature of ritual in this series, whether the processional pomp of the City of Dionysia, the Divine Liturgy of Mount Athos or the Greater Mysteries of Eleusis. Watching soccer is an undoubtedly lesser mystery, with a more humble and humdrum set of ritual actions, but they also have meaning. And every fan has their rituals and superstitions.","Before leaving the apartment, I carefully select my Liverpool shirt, track suit or scarf (depending on the weather, but I always look a teensy bit ridiculous) and walk to Syntagma or Constitution Square. I descend into the underworld of the subway system, take the four stops to Panormou station, buy a piece of spanakopita or sumptuous spinach pie from the bakery, walk slowly uphill eating it, get to the Wee Dram, push open the door, scan the room for seats and look for John. He’s always sitting in the same spot (it’s a superstition, he told me), just next to the big TV, head down, looking at his phone. Although I always try to get there early, the place is usually packed. John seems to have a secret supply of stools that he will whip out if a regular comes in late and the place is too crammed with fans.","John gives the nod, says a few words, and a seat opens up. I shake hands with everyone, ask them how they are doing, head to the bar, buy a pint of Murphy’s (they don’t sell Guinness), sit down and check the WhatsApp connection with my son Edward in London. We exchange a couple of short messages like “I’m in position. You?” and then discuss the team lineup and usually wonder why our German coach Juergen Klopp has included or left out a player we particularly like. The Wi-Fi tends to keep dropping, which occasions much dashing out into the street.","The Wee Dram is owned by Ross, who incidentally used to play for the Scottish national basketball team (I didn’t know they had one) and supports Hearts of Midlothian. To each their own. The pub has two main areas, a glass-walled central room where you can buy drinks, which is where the younger lads tend to gather, standing together in small groups, often wearing Liverpool shirts, and a larger outside area with older fans, sitting or standing. I prefer to sit, at least until something really exciting happens and then I stand and retreat backward to the door of the pub, so I don’t block anyone’s view. For reasons that completely escape me, I often crouch with my arms at a right angle and fists softly clenched. It’s almost an attitude of prayer.","There’s a large wooden central rectangular table with benches where the hard-core fans sit, with John in pole position, top left. Most of them are smoking (Athens is a great place to pick up a passive smoking habit. Smoking is banned, of course, but Greeks tend to do what they want), drinking beer or coffee and betting online on their phones. Just behind the central table is another, smaller table with about four or five seats, marked “reserved” (although it turns out that all the tables are “reserved”). This is where I sit, usually with some familiar faces. We talk to one another as much as we can, in broken English and fragmentary Greek, but in great detail about the qualities of particular players, tactics, formation and the strength of the opposition. Although we don’t really know one another that well, there is an immense of feeling of familiarity, affection and trust.","For the non-fan, it’s hard to explain how detailed these discussions are and the extraordinary levels of knowledge that ordinary fans possess. Although this might sound stupid, there is an amazing rational intelligence to soccer talk, bolstered by a common passion for the team that we all love.","The teams emerge, I sit up straight, and there is the usual fluff of TV commercials and dumb graphics before kickoffs. We all clap when the whistle blows, and then we enter the shared and strangely meditative flow of the game. Things get really quiet. There is always an odd experience of tension in watching a game with a group of fellow fans, waiting for your team to score or at least have a shot or engage in a compelling passage of play. The TV in the Wee Dram has useless speakers, and it is a real strain to catch the Greek commentary. Not really understanding the words, I listen eagerly for the names, which have an almost magical aura: Van Dijk, Robertson, Sadio Mane, Milner, Alexander-Arnold.","Of course, there are a lot of complaints, when there is a misplaced pass or especially when our star forward player, Mohammed Salah, shoots and misses, which has been happening a lot of late. The most frequently heard word in the bar is “malakas.” Let’s just say this is a word with a wide range of semantic connotations, many of them connected with the sin of onanism. There is a visceral connection between soccer and swearing, and I am at my most disgustingly foul-mouthed when watching Liverpool play. I am not proud of this fact and often try to swallow the vowel after the first consonant of the bad word has spilled from my lips.","When we score, the place explodes. Skintight anxiety suddenly releases into ecstasy. Everyone leaps to their feet, with wild scenes of joy, hugging and loud cries. I high-five everyone around the table, often inaccurately. I don’t know why I do it. It’s not my style. But I started the habit at my first match in January and somehow feel obliged to continue because they expect it from me. It’s a little awkward.","When the opposing team score, there is absolute silence in the bar. Not a word. And barely any reaction. The mood shifts entirely and no one speaks for at least 10 seconds, then: “Malakas.”","My three months in Athens has been a very tense time to be a Liverpool fan. A six-point January lead in the English Premier League has been whittled away by the relentlessness of our main opponents and reigning champions, Manchester City, and the fact that we drew a number of games that we should have won. We’ve lost some of our flair, flow and attacking rhythm. But we’re still in there fighting, match by match, grinding out victories often with last-minute goals. A nerve-shredding experience.","Today, March 31, is an absolutely vital game. I arrive very early at the Wee Dram, about 45 minutes before kickoff, around 5:45 p.m. There is a lot of banter, more beer is being drunk than usual, and servers slide through the crowd setting down pizzas that are always shared. Liverpool are playing Tottenham Hotspur, and my son Edward is at the Anfield Road stadium with his mate Ben watching live. Edward is a large part of the reason the fate of Liverpool Football Club in this season’s English Premier League matters so much to me. I deviously programmed him in his childhood years to support Liverpool, and he is now a better, more knowledgeable fan than I. But he has never seen Liverpool win the league; it is 29 years since it last happened. Liverpool won it 13 times during my first 30 years on planet Earth. But that history feels as ancient as Athens itself.","Spurs are a fine team. Some of my best friends are Spurs fans. They didn’t deserve to lose. But, very obligingly, they did, thanks to a goal-keeping blunder from the World Cup-winning French captain Hugo Lloris off a cheeky header from the sinuous Salah that ricocheted into the net off the shin of Toby Alderweireld in the 90th minute of the match. Call it luck, if you like. I choose to call it destiny.","It is hard to describe the feeling of sheer unconfined joy when your team wins. Everything is right with the world and the mind is free of any concern, distance or gnawing introspection. Here at the Wee Dram, there is a genuine feeling of warmth and solidarity among fans. Despite the linguistic limitations, we understand one another very well because we have a team in common. And there are 300 official Liverpool supporters clubs all around the world and countless other millions watching in whatever way they can. After the Spurs game, Ross played the Liverpool anthem, “You’ll Never Walk Alone” by Gerry and the Pacemakers and everyone sang along, bellowing out of tune at the top of their voices. It was really something.","I realize that such rituals are pretty stupid, shallow and far too sentimental, but at such moments I feel a real sense of disinhibited belonging, and other people feel the same. ","After the song climaxed and the final chorus faded, I finished my beer and looked for John to say goodbye. But he’d already left.","Will we win the league? Probably not. Manchester City are a better football team. But today we won. I don’t so much walk as glide down the hill to the subway station, texting with Edward and reading the early match reports. I pick up a loaf of bread at the bakery and head back into the center of the city. Life is good.",Athens in Pieces is an eight-part philosophical tour of the ancient city.

"In Soccer’s Biggest Elections, Accusations Are Common but Challengers Are Not - The New York Times","Soccer officials from one of FIFA’s largest confederations have gathered this week in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to elect a president. The balloting will take place at the end of a long day of speeches, motions and reports, but at least the setting — the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel — promises to be comfortable.","Before the vote is held, the incumbent, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, will have the opportunity to make a speech outlining his qualifications. His opponent will not.","That is because, as usual, there is no opponent.","For the third time in less than a year — the fourth will come in June — one of soccer’s largest and most powerful governing bodies will rubber-stamp the election of its leader in a one-candidate election. South America’s governing body, Conmebol, went first last May, when it granted President Alejandro Domínguez an unopposed second term, and Europe’s governing body, UEFA, followed suit in February by re-electing Aleksandr Ceferin. In June, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, will retain his post in yet another walkover.","“There has always seemed to be a great deal of fear around challenging the incumbent and because of the potential for retribution built into the system,” said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. For that reason, she said, regular uncontested elections are “not all that surprising.”",Wrage previously advised FIFA on corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization’s most vocal critics.,"In Asia, Sheikh Salman had been challenged — briefly — by opponents from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, two countries at the center of a broad political dispute that has spilled into soccer in a variety of ways, but both dropped out of the race late last month after a series of behind-the-scenes meetings in the Gulf.","Sheikh Salman’s presidency has been marred by controversy since he was elected in 2013 to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam, a wealthy Qatari businessman who was banned for life in the wake of a corruption investigation. His connections to Bahrain’s royal family, for example, have led to Sheikh Salman’s recusing himself from a role in some of the Asian Football Confederation’s most sensitive decisions, such as in the highly publicized case of Hakeem al-Araibi, a soccer player who fled to Australia after claiming he had been tortured by the Bahraini government during pro-democracy demonstrations there in 2011.",Salman also did not take part in discussions over how to deal with the pirating of the A.F.C.’s Qatari broadcast partner’s programing by an illegal operation based in Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is among the countries backing the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar.,"The re-election of incumbents, routinely without opposition, is common in soccer, where the power structures remain closely held despite a sprawling investigation in 2015 by the United States Department of Justice that exposed corruption schemes at the highest levels of the sport dating back decades.","The American case largely avoided implicating officials in Asia, but by then regional soccer leaders had already faced a reckoning after a series of internal investigations into the conduct of Sheikh Salman’s predecessor, Bin Hammam, and his leadership team. Those reports, including one by the former F.B.I. chief Louis Freeh, exposed a series of unexplained payments made to soccer officials throughout Asia and Africa.","The reports, three in total, which have been reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of payments made on behalf of Bin Hammam by the A.F.C.’s longtime media partner, World Sports Group, and specifically its regional head, the Lebanese businessman Pierre Kakhia. The payments included legal fees for an official from Tahiti who was facing an ethics ban, and money to a consulting firm hired to promote Bin Hammam’s bid for the FIFA presidency.","Despite his links to Bin Hammam, Kakhia remains a trusted consultant to the A.F.C., currently responsible for handling millions of dollars worth of sponsorship contracts, even though he last worked for W.S.G.’s parent company in 2016.",The A.F.C. declined to say why it had retained the services of Kakhia.,"As well as Sheikh Salman’s re-election, delegates at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur will pick candidates for coveted places on global soccer’s ruling body, the FIFA Council. That contest, featuring eight candidates vying for six places, has proved to be contentious.","South Korean officials have complained to the A.F.C. over perceived double standards in ethics rules after their country was barred from inviting soccer officials to Seoul to attend an exhibition game last month, a prohibition that was not extended to Qatar, which wrote to officials inviting them on an all-expenses paid trip to attend two matches there. Both South Korea and Qatar have candidates in the election, as does the Philippines, whose candidate, the South Koreans contend, has been using a private jet owned by a Qatari official to travel across the region during his campaign.","“We urgently request you to review this matter in relation to any violation against the relevant regulations in force,” the Korean soccer federation president, Chong Mong-gyu, wrote in a letter to the A.F.C. The A.F.C., which confirmed it had received the South Koreans’ complaint, declined to say why it had not issued the same warning to Qatar.","Sheikh Salman’s challengers dropped out of the presidential race after a series of decisions by the A.F.C., including the surprising move to break an exclusive television contract with the A.F.C.’s broadcast partner, the Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports, in order to allow games to be broadcast in Saudi Arabia, where games have been broadcast illegally for almost two years. BeIN said it planned to sue the A.F.C. over the decision.","Until that decision, Saudi Arabia had been supporting an Emirati candidate, Mohammad Khalfan al-Rumaithi. Rumaithi withdrew his candidacy shortly after the television agreement was struck. The third candidate, Saoud al-Mohannadi of Qatar, soon followed suit."
Powerful Sheikh Linked to Bribe Scheme Is Still a Soccer Power - The New York Times,"After more than a decade of involvement in women’s soccer, Mariyam Mohamed felt she had shot of making a convincing case to voters picking Asia’s female representative on FIFA’s governing council. She did not realize a powerful Arab sheikh would play a significant role in deciding exactly who gets a seat at soccer’s top table.","The Asian Football Confederation last week decided to re-elect Bangladesh’s Mahfuza Akhter Kiron, who was practically unknown when she beat more experienced challengers in 2017, and has rarely spoken during her tenure in the $250,000 a year post.","Kiron, though, had the backing of Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah of Kuwait, who steered voters toward his desired outcome, according a complaint Mohamed filed with A.F.C.’s election oversight panel and numerous officials involved with the process. The complaint, which was reviewed by The New York Times, was also sent to FIFA.","The sheikh, who runs the Olympic Council of Asia, an umbrella group for Olympic committees created by his late father, was identified as a co-conspirator in a Department of Justice soccer corruption case in 2017. He subsequently resigned from FIFA’s ruling council and pledged to withdraw from soccer while the case was being litigated.",His continuing involvement shows how the most influential figures at the highest levels of international sport often find ways to maintain their grip on the levers of power even when they are not supposed to.,"At the A.F.C.’s elections, the sheikh’s luxury suite at Kuala Lumpur’s Hyatt Hotel, close to the venue where voters had gathered, was where decisions were taken, according to officials that met with him, including Mohamed, a soccer official from the Maldives, who met with him in his suite.","In the complaint and in an interview with The New York Times, Mohamed provided a rare glimpse of how power functions at the highest levels of soccer, and how little has changed even in the aftermath of a major scandal in 2015.","Sheikh Ahmad, she said, told her to drop out of the election because he had already decided to back Kiron. If she did as she was told, he would be able to place Mohamed in another position, either at FIFA or within Asian soccer. If she didn’t, her career was effectively over, and her country, would also suffer, he suggested.","“He said this is how it works in politics, it’s not football,” Mohamed recalled of the meeting in a telephone interview. “He said: ‘It’s not based on experience, it’s the relationships we have with each other.’ And that was the end.”","Mohamed tried to convince him to change his mind, but he would not.","“I said, ‘Please don’t do this,’” she said. “I didn’t want to withdraw. I just wanted to tell him not to use his powers to influence this.”",A spokesman for Ahmad at the Olympic Council of Asia did not respond to a request for comment.,"The elections determined which officials would represent Asia at FIFA and on the confederation’s ruling council. The voting was also supposed to confirm Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa for another term as president, but his opponents withdrew before the poll.","The night before the elections on April 6, several members present said they received a list of 16 candidates promoted by Ahmad. All of them won seats in the elections.","The A.F.C. said in a statement that the elections are supervised by an independent body and according to guidelines to “ensure fair, honest and credible elections.”","In April 2017 Ahmad was described as “co-conspirator 2” in the guilty plea of a former associate in the United States, who claimed he had received about $1 million, to influence soccer elections at the A.F.C. Following the revelations, Ahmad, who denies any accusations of wrongdoing, quit soccer, but retained powerful positions on the International Olympic Committee. Ahmad had previously lobbied for Thomas Bach to secure the International Olympic Committee presidency in 2013.","In November last year, he was forced to temporarily step away from his I.O.C positions after being implicated in a new scandal. Swiss authorities indicted him on forgery charges. He denies those accusations, too, describing them as “politically motivated.”","He didn’t, however, step down from the Olympic Council of Asia, which wields considerable influence throughout the region because it distributes money from the I.O.C. for sports programs in Asia.","Ahmad’s support also boosted Qatar, the biggest winners at the Asian soccer elections. A candidate from the tiny emirate that is preparing to stage the 2022 World Cup secured both the vice presidency of the A.F.C. and a position on the FIFA Council. Those victories came at the expense of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two nations that had been lobbying against Qatar amid a bitter political dispute.","Qatar’s soccer federation president, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed Al Thani, a member of its ruling family, was present at Mohamed’s meeting with Ahmad, said Mohamed. Vahid Kardany, head of international relations at the A.F.C., was also there. Kardany had worked directly for Ahmad earlier in his career. Kardany didn’t respond to a request for comment, neither did officials in Qatar.","Two years ago, Australia’s Moya Dodd lost her seat as Asia’s female representative to Kiron, then a completely unknown candidate from Bangladesh, a soccer backwater where women’s soccer was almost non- existent.",Members of the 37-member council said Kiron has yet to speak at a meeting.,"Kiron hasn’t spoken because “things are O.K.,” Bangladesh soccer president Kazi Salahuddin said by phone. “Things are going so well she said she doesn’t need to speak. There’s no point repeating the same things as everyone else.”",He said the support from the Olympic Council of Asia “probably helped” her re-election efforts.
U.S. Soccer Invites South American Teams for Rich New Tournament in 2020 - The New York Times,U.S. Soccer has invited South America’s 10 soccer federations to bring their national teams to the United States in 2020 for a new intercontinental championship that would run concurrently with that summer’s European Championship.,"The offer, a package that includes almost $200 million in guarantees to the invited teams and their governing bodies, was made Tuesday in a letter from U.S. Soccer’s president, Carlos Cordeiro, to his counterparts at the 10 South American federations. For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents, but with no agreement in sight, U.S. Soccer, eager to fill a gap in the global soccer calendar and bearing an enticing nine-figure offer, is now proposing to establish its own.","In the letter, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation — and both confederations — millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Cordeiro has invited the South Americans to a meeting to discuss the proposal next week in Miami.","The proposed 16-team tournament would resemble, in structure though most likely not in name, the 2016 Copa América Centenario. That tournament, a relocated version of the South American championship — expanded to celebrate the event’s 100th anniversary — brought the 10 members of the South American confederation, Conmebol, to the United States for a month to face off not only against one another, but also a half-dozen opponents from Concacaf, the regional confederation made up of North and Central America and the Caribbean.","That tournament was considered a sporting and — perhaps more important — a financial success, and was won by Chile, which beat Argentina in a penalty-kick shootout in the final in East Rutherford, N.J. The new event would take place in June and July next year.","The proposed 2020 tournament would again include all 10 South American teams, plus six from Concacaf, and would most likely feature a group stage and then a knockout round to determine a champion. U.S. Soccer’s role in the offer, and Concacaf’s consent, would be critical to making the event happen, since both would have to approve any plans to hold such an event in the United States.",Concacaf released a statement Tuesday night acknowledging receipt of Cordeiro’s overture and expressing support for its broad strokes: “We view this opportunity positively as it is not intended to replace or substitute any future editions of the Concacaf Gold Cup and it complements our vision to continue providing opportunities for our Member Associations to play competitive football at the highest level.”,"In his letter, a draft of which was seen by The New York Times, Cordeiro took pains to emphasize that the new event would be a singular tournament, and not meant to replace existing events like the Copa América or the Gold Cup, which would continue separately. Conmebol, which will contest this year’s Copa in June and July in Brazil, said last year that it was planning to shift the Copa América to a quadrennial schedule starting in 2020, to coincide with UEFA’s European Championship. Concacaf holds its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, in odd-numbered years; this year’s Gold Cup matches will be played in the United States, Costa Rica and at least one Caribbean nation.","For next summer, though, Cordeiro is proposing a larger, intercontinental event in the United States. The event could fill a gap in the global soccer calendar — at the moment, the Euros are the only major championship scheduled for that summer — but despite the millions being offered, it is unclear how South American and Conmebol officials will react to a tournament that would conflict with their Copa América plans.","The Copa América has included guest teams for years; Mexico and the United States have participated in it several times, and this year it will include Japan and Qatar.","For the United States, though, the event could have several positives. FIFA is expected to choose the dozen or so host cities for the 2026 World Cup in the next two years, so the tournament could be a chance for the 17 finalists to make their case for inclusion. It also would offer meaningful competition for the United States men’s national team as it heads into qualifying for the 2022 World Cup; that process began later than hoped because the search for the team’s head coach, Gregg Berhalter, was delayed, first by the World Cup bid and then by the search for a general manager to run the national team program. Hired in December, Berhalter has coached only two friendlies to date as he prepares for this summer’s Gold Cup.","If the proposed tournament with Conmebol does not come to fruition, U.S. Soccer could still press ahead with a new event, possibly a scaled-down tournament involving teams from other continents."
Hacker Who Leaked Soccer’s Secrets Loses Extradition Hearing - The New York Times,"A computer hacker who for years published the innermost secrets of the global soccer industry — revelations that have shed light on questionable behavior by some of the sport’s most influential figures and top clubs — was told on Tuesday that he would be extradited to Portugal, where he faces charges linked to his activities.","Lawyers for the man, Rui Pinto, 30, immediately said they planned to appeal the decision made by a court in Budapest, where he was arrested in January. They argued that his whistle-blowing activities far outweighed any crimes he might have committed in securing the documents. In Portugal, Mr. Pinto is charged with an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.","The leaks first emerged in 2015, on a website called Football Leaks, before Mr. Pinto, a year later, joined with the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and a group of other European news media organizations to slowly disseminate related news articles. They painted an unflattering picture of an industry troubled by questionable efforts to avoid millions of dollars in tax, flagrant rule breaking by some top clubs and an alleged sexual assault by one of soccer’s biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo.","While the Portuguese authorities want to put Mr. Pinto on trial, their counterparts in France and Belgium have said they want to work with him, to gain access to the enormous database he has compiled as they continue investigations into figures in the soccer world. The ruling in Hungary makes that difficult, said Francisco Teixeira da Mota, who is part of a legal team that includes William Bourdon, a French lawyer who previously represented the national security whistle-blower Edward Snowden.","Hungarian officials seized all of Mr. Pinto’s computer equipment, including hard drives containing the soccer industry data, when he was arrested. The Hungarian judge ruled that all of that can be sent to Portuguese authorities. That will chill efforts by the authorities in other countries, and make it impossible for further revelations to emerge, Mr. Teixeira da Mota said.","“We think if he’s extradited to Portugal it would put a stop to all that,” he said, adding that the Portuguese case is limited to Mr. Pinto’s conduct in relation to the investment fund Doyen Sports and the soccer team Sporting Clube de Portugal.",It is not clear how much of the data Der Spiegel possesses and how much of it the news weekly is prepared to share with investigators.,"While being hailed as a whistle-blower by many, Mr. Pinto’s past conduct has raised questions about his motives. He reached an out-of-court settlement with the Caledonian Bank after being accused of hacking into its systems and transferring thousands of dollars from one of its client accounts. Mr. Pinto denies he stole any of the money, but citing a nondisclosure agreement, he has declined to provide further details.","As he awaits his fate, news media groups with access to his data continue to publish new revelations. As recently as last weekend, details emerged of an apparent effort by the Premier League giant Manchester City to circumvent fiscal rules set by European soccer’s governing body by disguising sponsorship payments, and another alleged scheme by the same club to run an off-the-books player recruitment fund.","Mr. Pinto’s appeal is likely to take up to two weeks to be settled, his lawyer said."
‘The Hooligans Were the Club’ - The New York Times,"MYSLENICE, Poland — The dark, uneven soil at Wisla Krakow’s training facility in this village 40 minutes south of Poland’s second largest city was frozen solid last month as a few hundred supporters trudged through the snow to greet Jakub Blaszczykowski.","Blaszczykowski, a 33-year-old midfielder, has played in some of soccer’s biggest matches, including the 2013 Champions League final as a member of Borussia Dortmund, two European championships, and a World Cup with Poland’s national team.","But on this January afternoon, Blaszczykowski was a long way from those moments. Instead, he was about to play his first exhibition game since rejoining Wisla Krakow, one of Poland’s most decorated teams. Wisla is the club Blaszczykowski made his name with, and the team he had promised to someday return to when he signed with Dortmund in 2007.","He was not returning to ease into retirement, though, or for a final payday. In fact, the opposite was true: Blaszczykowski, known as Kuba, had come home in an unusual deal in which he agreed to take virtually no money to play and to join with two Polish investors to lend the club 1.33 million zloty (about $350,000) to cover his new teammates’ unpaid wages.","The Wisla Krakow he rejoined, he knew, was in dire straits, its proud history besmirched after a series of disastrous events involving a hooligan takeover, missing money and a mysterious foreign investor who offered himself as a savior, collected the club’s ownership certificates and then — without producing even a single zloty — disappeared.","Wisla Krakow’s problems were years in the making. But they started to accelerate in 2016, when the team’s longtime owner, Boguslaw Cupial, decided to sell the club.","Cupial had been one of Poland’s postcommunist success stories, earning millions through his cable company, Tele-Fonika. In 1997, he invested some of his fortune in Wisla, transforming the club into an eight-time league champion under his stewardship. But Cupial took a big hit in the 2008 global financial crisis and in 2016 sold the money-losing club to a local buyer.","That buyer promptly flipped the club to TS Wisla, a supporter-friendly umbrella organization that already controlled Wisla Krakow’s other sports teams. The businessman, it turned out, had no money, said Michal Trela, a reporter for Przeglad Sportowy, a Polish sports daily. “After one month,” Trela said, “the supporters bought the club back for 1 zloty” — around 25 cents.","In an age of superrich foreign owners in soccer, a sale that actually gave fans a say in the running of their club should have been refreshing. But at Wisla, the purchase appeared to hand control to a group of soccer hooligans called the Sharks.","“Almost every club in Poland has a problem with hooligans,” said Szymon Jadczak, an investigative reporter for the Polish television network TVN. “But in Wisla, the hooligans were the club.”","The Sharks have a loud, intimidating presence at Wisla’s stadium and in 2015 a group of them made headlines when they were photographed giving the Nazi salute while in Rome to watch Roma play Lazio. Now they were calling the shots at Wisla Krakow, under the leadership of Pawel Michalski, who had served more than six years in prison for throwing a knife from the stands at an Italian player during a UEFA Cup match. Through TS Wisla, Michalski was able to ensure that two people with close connections to the Sharks were put in charge of the club, and contracts for everything from cleaning the stadium to printing the match-day programs were signed with friends and associates at what were viewed as inflated rates. The club, Jadczak said, became a “sort of cash machine” for people connected to the Sharks’ leadership.","When questions were raised, the Wisla president installed after the Sharks’ takeover, Marzena Sarapata, held a news conference to dismiss the claims that the hooligan group effectively controlled the club. But a few months later, an arrest warrant was issued for Michalski, whom the police charged with heading a criminal group and with having involvement in the drug trade. Shortly afterward, Poland’s Central Bureau of Investigation undertook a series of raids in which they arrested dozens of hooligans. Michalski left Poland.","Jadczak’s televised investigation about the takeover and mismanagement at Wisla — broadcast by TVN in September — was the last straw; the club’s top officials resigned, and the city of Krakow persuaded Poland’s soccer authorities to send any money owed to the club to the city instead, to cover unpaid rent at a city-owned stadium. Michalski was eventually arrested in Italy; he will stand trial later this year. ", Sarapata did not respond to phone calls or messages from The New York Times but did give an interview to a website owned by the same Polish betting company that sponsors Wisla and denied all the allegations. ,"Meanwhile, the video clips of hooligans being arrested and of searches at TS Wisla’s headquarters made finding a new investor for the club difficult. And the unpaid players merely fell into line with the other debtors. ",Wisla needed a savior.,"In December, it thought it had found one. A French-Cambodian businessman named Vanna Ly, who claimed to have extensive investments in soccer clubs around the world, announced he would be purchasing 60 percent of Wisla Krakow. The rest would be owned by Noble Capital Partners, a British investment firm represented by a Swedish businessman, Mats Hartling. The deal was reported to be for 12 million zloty ($3.2 million).","Ly arrived in Krakow to watch a game and began to meet people connected to the club. Invariably, they knew little about him beyond his name and his promise to invest. ","“I met Vanna Ly, he’s real, he exists,” said Rafal Wislocki, one of the few team officials untainted by association with the Sharks. “He has ID. I saw this ID. French ID.”","Ly, Wislocki and other club officials took in a 1-0 league defeat against Lech Poznan on Dec. 21. It was the last game before the winter break, and Wisla Krakow, despite the crisis, sat a creditable eighth in the 16-team Polish league. ","Ly made clear that he was not impressed with the standard of play, Wislocki said, but at least sounded as if he knew how to run a soccer club. “He knew the answer when I asked difficult questions,” Wislocki said.","The purchase contract was signed, though in hindsight, team officials said, even then something was awry: Despite claiming to control millions of dollars, Ly arrived in Krakow on a budget airline, and when he was spotted leaving Krakow’s city hall after a meeting, he attempted to hide from reporters under a black umbrella. ","The bulk of the money to pay off the team’s debts was due a few days later, but it never arrived. At first, Ly told Wisla officials that his phone had been stolen, preventing him from sending the cash. Later, they were told that Ly had had a heart attack on his private jet as it flew to New York.","Ly was never heard from again. Despite repeated attempts by The Times to contact him by email and by phone, he did not respond. After initially hanging up the phone, Hartling emailed a one-line reply: “Ly is a criminal who will be pursued accordingly.”","Asked about Ly in a text message, Adam Pietrowski, the player agent who had brought Hartling to Wisla and was briefly club president, replied with an emoji: a sad face with a Pinocchio nose.","By then, Wisla Krakow had bigger problems than a missing investor. European soccer’s midseason transfer window would open Jan. 1, and with the club’s license to play suspended because of its grim financial state, and with its unpaid players likely to depart, Wisla had only a few weeks to stabilize its affairs.","Wislocki, who had successfully run the team’s youth academy, was appointed club president. Blaszczykowski, out of favor at his German club, Wolfsburg, suggested he would consider a return. In January, he and the two investors he had joined forces with delivered a vital infusion of cash to cover the team’s back wages. Still, he delayed his full commitment to play until the restoration of Wisla’s license was assured.","In the end, Wisla sold eight members of its squad in January, but the payment from Blaszczykowski, as well as the promise of playing alongside a player revered in Poland, stemmed the hemorrhaging of talent.","“Kuba gives us belief that we can make this club great again,” Wislocki said.","A few days after his first exhibition match, Blaszczykowski trotted onto the freezing field in Myslenice again as a large crowd sung his name. If anything, it was even colder. Again Wisla lost, again by 3-2, and again a crowd gathered by the entrance to the training ground in hopes of taking a photograph with Kuba.","As the second half of that game began, word arrived that Wisla’s most urgent crisis was over: The league had restored the team’s license, allowing it to sell tickets to its remaining games. Wislocki announced that the club was selling 5 percent of its shares to fans; in less than 24 hours, the offer raised 4 million zloty (a little more than $1 million). Blaszczykowski eventually signed his contract, although league rules prevented him from playing for free. Instead, he’ll donate his 500 zloty minimum wage ($130) to a local children’s home. And he finally made his league debut in a 2-0 defeat against Gornik Zabrze last week. A new owner still needs to be found — without one, said Trela, the journalist, “it will be impossible to get a new license for next season” — but Wisla is breathing a little easier.","Its coach, the former Poland international Maciej Stolarczyk, who took the job last summer, has known only chaos and financial crisis at the club. He, too, had met Ly, whose bold promises, he said, had been magnified by the Polish news media. ","“They said we will be another Manchester City in Poland!” Stolarczyk said, laughing. “But I want to say the team didn’t believe everything they were told.”","His only concern now is the second half of the season. Having one of Poland’s best players is a bonus, he said, but he is acutely aware of the weight that Blaszczykowski carries. ","“Everyone will be looking at him, everyone will be talking about him, and also all the rivals will try to stop him,” Stolarczyk said. “So our task is to try and protect him.”","Long after the final whistle of his first game back, Blaszczykowski did not seem to need protection. He was standing stone-faced as he signed every shirt that was handed to him and posed for every selfie. ","He was why parents had brought their children out in the biting cold to press against the fence, to squint into the low winter sun. He was why Wisla fans had hope again.","“We love Kuba,” one man said. “Kuba is our hero.”"
Players Say Soccer Chief Sexually Abused Them for Years. He May Still Win. - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan — He was their nightmare, the young, female Afghan soccer players say: a menacing 57-year-old with two wives who locked the door to his back office with a biometric keypad that only he could open.","Many of those young soccer players, members of the women’s national team, lined up to accuse the man, the president of Afghan soccer, Keramuddin Keram, of sexually assaulting them in a bed he kept in that room, and elsewhere, charges they made both in public statements and to Afghan prosecutors. Women who rebuffed his advances were labeled lesbians and expelled from the team, according to eight former players who said that had happened to them.","Three months later, however, the investigation into sexual abuse in Afghan soccer is stalled, amid fears it will never proceed. It has yet to result in any criminal charges.","One of Mr. Keram’s accusers, the soccer player Khalida Popal, said he had actively pursued women who testified against him in Afghanistan, warning them to withdraw the charges. And witnesses like her who live in exile have not been interviewed in person by Afghan investigators, as required by law, because so far the investigators have not been able to get visas.","Mr. Keram remains the president of the Afghanistan Football Federation, which is in charge of men’s and women’s soccer, the country’s most popular sport, although he is suspended by order of the attorney general. And FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, has just extended Mr. Keram’s ban from participating in national and international soccer for three more months, as its own investigation, nearly a year old, grinds on.",Neither FIFA nor Mr. Keram responded to requests for comment.,"Despite public support from President Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan investigation has run into a powerful lobby made up of supporters of Mr. Keram from Panjshir, a politically dominant province in northern Afghanistan. Once a local warlord and later governor of the province, Mr. Keram remains well connected with the Jamiat-i-Islami party, the major political force in the north.","Prosecutors have the power to arrest Mr. Keram but have not done so, though they have blocked him from leaving the country. “If the investigative committee thinks they need to arrest him, they will do so,” said Jamshid Rasooli, the attorney general’s spokesman.","Mr. Rasooli confirmed a report by ToloNews, an Afghan television news program, that two of the attorney general’s investigators had not yet obtained visas to interview witnesses in Europe, which has led to speculation that the visas were denied for fear that the investigators would claim asylum themselves. He said they had been waiting for the visas for more than a month.","Ms. Popal, 31, reached by telephone in Denmark, said she had heard from at least three soccer players in the past two months who withdrew their charges against Mr. Keram after they received direct, personal threats from him.","Two of the women answered calls from someone they knew, who then handed the phone to Mr. Keram. In the third case, the woman was walking to soccer practice in Kabul near the football federation offices when she was forced into a car with blacked-out windows, finding Mr. Keram inside, Ms. Popal was told.","“He told them, ‘I know you have been to the attorney general’s office and given testimony against us,’ ” Ms. Popal said. “ ‘Go and take back the testimony. You know I am a powerful person. Nobody will put me in jail. I will win this case. It’ll take some time, but then what will happen to you? Think about your future and what will happen to you and your family.’ ”","Ms. Popal said the three women, whom she declined to identify for their safety, had gone into hiding and were no longer willing to testify against Mr. Keram.","Mr. Keram did not respond to repeated efforts to contact him for comment. A spokesman for the Afghan federation, Shafi Shadab, who had earlier spoken on behalf of Mr. Keram, said Saturday that the attorney general had ordered him to have no further contact with the soccer chief. The federation’s Facebook page has posted a statement denying all of the charges.","Ms. Popal was one of the founders of women’s soccer in Afghanistan and remained active with the team after fleeing to Denmark, where she claimed asylum in 2011. She accused Mr. Keram of the rape and sexual assault of other players and claimed to have evidence that she had reported those claims to the federation early last year with no response.","“The president of A.F.F. and some trainers are raping and sexually harassing female players,” she said in a December interview. She earlier made similar claims in an interview with The Guardian.","In addition to Mr. Keram, four other members of the federation were suspended and banned from travel. The ban on one of them, the federation’s deputy president, Yosuf Kargar, was lifted in January after the attorney general’s office said it had found no evidence against him.",Mr. Keram appealed his suspension by FIFA but was denied.,"Earlier, the sponsor of the Afghan national women’s team, the Danish sportswear manufacturer Hummel, withdrew its financial support over what it called “strong allegations of severe mental, physical, sexual and equal rights abuse of the female players by male A.F.F. officials.”","Last month, Kelly Lindsey, the American coach of the Afghan women’s team, urged FIFA to step in and take more concrete action. It could, for instance, ban the Afghan teams from competition.","“I think FIFA really needs to stand up here. They are the governing body of football and if they allow this to happen in their culture, then it’s easy for it to be pushed under the rug,” she said in an interview with Reuters.","FIFA has defended its actions, noting that it suspended Mr. Keram and is investigating the allegations. It added that it had “zero tolerance” for sexual abuse. Last week, FIFA said the head of its investigation had requested that Mr. Keram’s ban be extended for 90 days, and that the organization had agreed.","“During this time, Mr. Karim will continue to be banned from all football-related activities at both national and international level,” it said, using an alternative transliteration of Mr. Keram’s name.","Human Rights Watch weighed in last month, urging both FIFA and the Afghan authorities to move more decisively on their investigations. “FIFA, which said it began investigating these allegations last April, should share information with Afghan investigators and maintain a ban on accused officials,” the rights group said.","Mr. Rasooli said the Afghan attorney general was determined to fully pursue the case against Mr. Keram and the others accused. They have not been arrested, he said, because under Afghan law that would limit the time the authorities had to conduct their investigation.","“This is a complicated case,” he said. “We have interviewed 30 witnesses inside Afghanistan and that part of the case is almost completed.”",He added that the authorities still hoped to obtain European visas for investigators.,Ms. Popal said she was still hopeful that the investigation of Mr. Keram and his colleagues would succeed.,"“I really respect and trust the committee in the attorney general’s office working on this case,” she said. “At the same time, I don’t know how powerful they are once the case is out of their hands. And he is a powerful guy, with so much influence inside the government.”"
Conmebol Rejects U.S. Soccer’s Offer for New Tournament - The New York Times,"South America’s top soccer official on Thursday rejected an invitation to take part in a proposed intercontinental tournament hosted and financed by U.S. Soccer in the summer of 2020, saying the continent’s governing body preferred to maintain the primacy of its own continental championship, the Copa América.","U.S. Soccer President Carlos Cordeiro had made the offer for a combined tournament featuring South America’s 10 teams and six from the region comprising North and Central America and the Caribbean in a letter earlier this week. U.S. Soccer’s offer would have been worth tens of millions of dollars for the South American teams, their regional rivals who took part, and the two confederations governing soccer in the Americas.","But in a letter to Cordeiro dated Wednesday, first reported by the Brazilian news outlet Globo, the president of the South American federation, Alejandro Dominguez, categorically rejected the invitation to a proposed Continental Cup in 2020. Dominguez’s letter cited a lack of FIFA approval for the new event, but also a preference to prioritize the Copa América, which is the oldest international soccer championship in the world.","Last year, officials from the South American confederation, Conmebol, announced plans to shift the Copa América to a quadrennial schedule starting in the summer of 2020.","But U.S. Soccer, frustrated by a lack of progress in talks for a combined international tournament, invited South America’s 10 soccer federations to take part in a 16-team championship held in the United States. The framework of the new tournament would have been similar to the 2016 Copa América Centenario, a one-time tournament celebrating the event’s 100th anniversary that was a financial and sporting success. U.S. Soccer sweetened its offer for 2020 with nearly $200 million in guarantees to the visiting teams and their confederations.","In his letter inviting the South Americans, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation — and both confederations — millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Conmebol and its northern neighbor, Concacaf, would receive $50 million each to go along. Cordeiro invited Conmebol officials to a meeting in Miami next week to discuss the proposal.",U.S. Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Conmebol’s decision to decline the offer.,"For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents. The Copa América will take place as planned this summer in Brazil, with Japan and Qatar filling the two guest spots often reserved for teams from Concacaf. Concacaf will hold its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, at the same time.","If the offer to Conmebol is not revived, U.S. Soccer is expected to press ahead with plans for a scaled-down tournament featuring national teams from other continents, potentially including Africa and Asia."
African Soccer Whistleblower Fired After Accusing Boss of Corruption - The New York Times,JOHANNESBURG — African soccer's ruling body has fired a senior official after he made corruption accusations against the organization's president in a potential blow to FIFA's efforts to clean up the game after a raft of scandals worldwide.,"The Confederation of African Football (CAF) sacked general secretary Amr Fahmy after the Egyptian accused his boss Ahmad Ahmad of bribes and misuse of hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to officials and an internal document.","The document, sent on March 31 by Fahmy to a FIFA body that investigates alleged ethics breaches and seen by Reuters, accuses Ahmad of ordering his secretary-general to pay $20,000 bribes into accounts of African soccer association presidents.",They included Cape Verde and Tanzania. ,"The document also accused Ahmad of costing CAF an extra $830,000 by ordering equipment via a French intermediary company called Tactical Steel.","Furthermore, it accuses him of harassing four female CAF staff, whom it did not name; violating statutes to increase Moroccan representation within the organization; and over-spending more than $400,000 of CAF money on cars in Egypt and Madagascar, where a satellite office has been set up for him.",LATEST FIFA CONTROVERSY,"Senior CAF officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Fahmy was fired after compiling the document with the allegations against Ahmad, from Madagascar, who took the top African soccer post two years ago.

A Soccer Pro at 13? Olivia Moultrie Will Give It a Try - The New York Times,Two years ago — in a move that delighted some in women’s sports and shocked others — Olivia Moultrie announced that she had accepted a scholarship offer to play college soccer at the University of North Carolina. She was 11 years old.,"On Monday, Moultrie, the youngest girls’ soccer player to publicly accept an academic scholarship offer, became the youngest girls’ soccer player to then officially forgo her college athletic eligibility. Now 13, Moultrie announced that she had signed, in short order, a representation deal with the Wasserman Media Group, a sports agency, and a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike. In taking those two actions, Moultrie formally began her professional career.","Moultrie’s agent, Spencer Wadsworth, declined to disclose the terms of the Nike deal, except to say that it was worth more financially than a four-year scholarship at a top university, which is generally valued at about $300,000.","“It’s just a shift in women’s sports,” Wadsworth said. “You see it more and more now where women’s soccer is catching up to the men’s side, and there’s more opportunities for them.”","Moultrie has already drawn worldwide attention for her prodigious technical skills and her family’s nontraditional approach to her nascent career. She has long played with older girls on the United States youth national team and with boys’ clubs near her family’s home in Canyon Country, Calif.","Last year, Moultrie made multiple trips to Europe to meet and train with some of the continent’s biggest clubs: Olympique Lyon and Paris St.-Germain in France, and Bayern Munich in Germany. And with the help of her father, K.C., she has maintained an active presence on social media, often posting highlight clips to more than 87,000 followers on Instagram.","“I feel for literally almost every kid in girls’ soccer, you should go to college; there’s not a million dollars at the end of the rainbow,” K.C. Moultrie said in an interview with The New York Times last year. “I think if you’re truly, truly elite, if your goal is to be a world-class player and a pro and, in Olivia’s case, to be the best player in the world, there’s no way it’s better to play college than it is to play full time.”","Moultrie’s next step is unclear. A move to Europe is most likely impossible for several years; FIFA rules, with certain exceptions, generally prevent youth prospects from signing with foreign clubs before they turn 18.","A far more likely prospect would involve Moultrie’s latching on as a developmental player with a team in the top United States league, the N.W.S.L. But that path has its own obstacles; before she could ever sign a professional contract, the league would essentially have to create new allocation rules to deal with her unique situation. In addition, a player currently must be 18 to play in the N.W.S.L.","Moultrie has been on her unconventional path for years. She began intense, soccer-specific training when she was 7 years old, started home schooling as a fifth grader to free her schedule for more soccer, and eventually became the first girl to play for a boys’ club team in the United States Development Academy system. She was 10 when she began attending college showcase camps, and at 11 she accepted a full scholarship offer from North Carolina.","That she gave up the scholarship was not a huge surprise. For one thing, sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas had long had Moultrie in their sights. Last year, when she was still an amateur, Nike featured her in a local promotional campaign for one of the company’s soccer cleats. On Sunday night, Moultrie appeared briefly near the end of a Nike commercial that aired during the Academy Awards.","Nike, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its deal with Moultrie.","Anson Dorrance, the longtime coach at North Carolina who had offered Moultrie a scholarship, said in an interview on Monday that he was pleased Moultrie had signed a deal for what he presumed was a significant amount of money, noting that the vast majority of women’s soccer players still struggle to make a steady living as professionals. He said Moultrie’s deal was a good development for the women’s game.","“We knew what was in the water, and we have no issue with this,” Dorrance said about Moultrie’s decision. “We lost a great player to the professional ranks, and we totally support that, if the financial incentives are good.”","Though it has long been common for boys in the United States to skip college to pursue soccer careers, it is a move that has so far made sense for only a few girls.","Just two members of the current United States women’s national team, for instance, have walked away from college scholarship offers for professional opportunities. Mallory Pugh was 19 when she did it two years ago, joining the N.W.S.L.’s Washington Spirit before ever suiting up for U.C.L.A. In 2012, Lindsey Horan joined P.S.G. at 18 after having accepted a scholarship offer from North Carolina.","But in doing so at 13, Moultrie has become an extreme outlier, even if — in all likelihood — it will be years before she has an opportunity to prove herself before a wide audience.","Dorrance said her skills were more than sufficient for her to thrive. The one, big question that remained, he said, was how much more she would mature physically.","“That’s the risk for any young kid whose ambition is to play at a high level,” Dorrance said, “or for a shoe company that is signing them young or a professional team that is signing them young.”"

"Soccer Pioneers, Priced Out by Progress - The New York Times","ROSSINGTON, England — Over the years, Sheila Edmunds has done pretty much everything for the Doncaster Belles. Half a century ago, she was among the group of friends who founded the club. For 25 years, she wore the team’s No. 8 jersey and, for a while, its captain’s armband.","When she retired, she filled in wherever required: welfare officer, first-aid practitioner, physiotherapist. Now her official title is president and general manager. If that sounds like an executive role, an honorary sinecure, it is not.","An hour or so before a game at the windswept stadium that the Belles now call home, Edmunds can be found in the simple wooden cabin that passes for a ticket office. At her back is an electric heater, on futile full blast to stave off the bitter cold. She welcomes fans handing over the £5 entrance fee warmly, as if each one is an old friend.","In quiet moments, she might help out at the trestle table that serves as the Belles’ merchandising arm. After kickoff, she keeps one eye on the game as she totals up the day’s takings; it is easier this way, she says. She is the one, after all, who will have to enter it all into the club’s accounts later.","There is more money in women’s soccer in England than there has ever been. Last summer, the country’s highest tier — the Women’s Super League (W.S.L.) — became, for the first time, fully professional, with a broadcasting arrangement with the BBC. England’s biggest clubs, including Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, all have invested heavily in their women’s teams in recent years, spending not just on homegrown players but for high-profile imports, too. Manchester United, even, has finally joined the fray: It launched its women’s team, in the second-tier Championship, last year, and immediately set about recruiting an all-star roster.","The effect has been seismic, not just in terms of results — Manchester City reached the Champions League semifinals the last two seasons and England’s national team finished third in the 2015 Women’s World Cup — but in terms of interest, too. More than 45,000 people attended last season’s women’s F.A. Cup final, and two million more watched it live on television.","Little or none of that growth, though, has found its way to Doncaster; or, more accurately, Rossington, a small village on the outskirts of the town, where Doncaster Rovers Belles play their home games in the third tier of English women’s soccer.","Crowds rarely number much more than a hundred here. There are no television cameras. Last summer, the club’s biggest sponsor walked away; its income now does not stretch far beyond the cash Edmunds sifts through in front of that electric heater.","And yet this is the team that has, arguably, done more for women’s soccer in England than any other, a club that was synonymous with the sport for decades. In the 1980s and early 1990s, long before the professional clubs showed any interest in women’s soccer, the Belles were its pre-eminent force.","Between 1983 and 1994, the Belles reached 11 of 12 women’s F.A. Cup finals, and won the trophy six times. The team won the first ever women’s national league title, in 1992, and regained the crown in 1994; it would finish as runners-up seven times in the following years.","Back then, its players formed the backbone of the English national team. “At one point, we had seven or eight players in the squad,” said Gillian Coultard, who spent 21 years playing for the Belles in the team’s heyday, and picked up 119 appearances for England. For a long time, she was one of five players to have made a century of appearances for her country. The others were Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Peter Shilton and Billy Wright. “It was a good quiz question,” she said.","Doncaster, of course, was proud of the Belles: A small, tight-knit town on the edge of the South Yorkshire coalfield, it is not a place that attracts much national attention, or frequently enjoys much sporting success. The Belles changed that. “We won so much,” Coultard said. “The cup finals were on television. We felt like we represented Doncaster, and South Yorkshire. We kept the town at the pinnacle.”","Edmunds remembers the club being asked to send representatives to have “afternoon tea with the Queen and Prince Philip” when they visited Doncaster. The players were guests of honor at the town’s Mansion House, the ornate Georgian home of the local authorities, on several occasions.","“We never had any sexist stuff,” she said. “South Yorkshire people aren’t like that. It’s the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do. They get behind you. There was a real pride at what we achieved.”","There was broader, cultural recognition, too. The writer Pete Davies spent a year with the team in the early 1990s; his subsequent book, “I Lost My Heart to the Belles,” coupled with the club’s success, made the name famous. The playwright Kay Mellor used the book as source material for “Playing the Field,” a BBC drama that ran for five seasons in the 1990s.","To many, at a time when women’s soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention, the Belles were the sport’s most prominent face. “They were the epitome of women’s football,” said Mike Blackham. Like most of the people who go to watch the Belles now, Blackham and his wife, Jane, have a personal connection to the club: A friend plays for the first team.","That is testament to how the club’s horizons have retracted in recent years. As the fortunes of women’s soccer have risen, those of the Belles have ebbed. “The women’s game has changed,” Edmunds said. “It is more financially driven. We have been left behind a little bit.”","In 2013, when the Football Association, the sport’s governing body in Britain, expanded the Women’s Super League to two divisions, Doncaster Belles were demoted to the second tier and Manchester City’s women’s team — far younger but, crucially, aligned with a Premier League behemoth — were promoted in their stead. Vic Akers, then the manager of Arsenal Ladies, described the decision as “morally scandalous.”","Doncaster was promoted back to the top flight in 2015, but lasted only a season before being relegated again. It won the second division last year, its first trophy since 1994, but did not take up its place in the top tier: The F.A. had changed the licensing criteria, and the Belles — lacking a headline sponsor and a major men’s team to bankroll the club — could not meet the new requirements. “Financially, we could not do it,” Edmunds said.","All but two members of the championship-winning side departed, many for Manchester United’s new women’s team. Neil Redfearn, the manager, left for Liverpool. The Belles decided against using the Keepmoat Stadium, the neat, modern venue that is home to Doncaster Rovers, the men’s team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance, and set up instead in Rossington, where the two stands are little more than a few steps covered by a roof. Smaller surroundings, Edmunds said, would not be as “daunting” for the young players that now comprised the team.","In Doncaster, the Belles’ fame endures, and so does the affection and esteem in which they are held. Edmunds, for example, is well-known enough in the town that, a few years ago, when she was awarded an honor in London for her contribution to sport, the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade: It referred to her by only her first name.","Blackham, who coaches a local junior team, finds that while young boys dream of Premier League stardom, the girls tend to have a different ambition. “They don’t talk about playing for Manchester City or Chelsea or Arsenal,” he said. “They want to play for the Belles.”","There is some regret at the club’s diminished status — “the demise of it is very sad, because it was so unique,” said Coultard — but there is no resentment of the game’s authorities, no lingering anger at the Football Association for failing to curate the most famous women’s team of all. “That era has gone,” Edmunds said. “We do not want people to forget that history, because so many people put so much into it, but we do not dwell on it.”","Instead, she said, she takes satisfaction in seeing all of the players who came through the club’s ranks who have gone on to play professionally, to play in Europe, to play for their country.","The golden age of the Belles may have come and gone, Edmunds said, but the club still has a role to play. “You look at those players and think we must be doing something right,” she said. “We still contribute. There is real pride in that.”","Those Belles may be wearing different jerseys now, playing for different clubs, but they still bear the stamp of the club she helped to create. They all add a little more sheen to the legacy. In Edmunds’s eyes, they are still Belles. “That’s what we have always said,” she said, turning back to the day’s takings. “Once a Belle, always a Belle.”"
Video Shows Undersea Wreck of Plane that Carried Soccer Star Emiliano Sala - The New York Times,"LONDON — The wreckage of the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer striker Emiliano Sala and his pilot, David Ibbotson, has been found on the seabed in the English Channel, a shipwreck hunter said on Sunday, days after parts of the aircraft’s seat cushions were discovered on a French beach.","The plane was found using an underwater drone that recorded video of the wreckage, including the body of one of the victims, the British government said on Monday. The video showed the aircraft registration number on the fuselage, confirming that it was the missing plane.","“The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by police,” David Mearns, the shipwreck hunter whose team had been searching for the Piper Malibu plane, said on Twitter.","The single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft  disappeared over the English Channel after departing Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Jan. 21, headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales.","Mr. Mearns, a maritime scientist, told the British broadcaster Sky News on Sunday evening that the vessel “was located earlier this morning by my crew onboard the Morven,” referring to the search ship FPV Morven. Mr. Mearns’s company, Blue Water Recoveries, had been collaborating with the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or A.A.I.B., scanning the sea floor using sonar.","A ship commissioned by the air accidents agency, the Geo Ocean III, launched a remotely operated vehicle, or R.O.V., to view the discovery at close range, the agency said in a statement on Monday.","“Based on analysis of R.O.V. video footage, the A.A.I.B. investigators on board the vessel concluded that the object is wreckage from the missing Piper Malibu aircraft, registration N264DB,” it said. The underwater drone “carried out a further search of the area overnight, but did not identify any additional pieces of wreckage.”","“Tragically, in video footage from the R.O.V., one occupant is visible amidst the wreckage,” the agency added, but it did not specify whether the body was Mr. Sala’s or Mr. Ibbotson’s. “The A.A.I.B. is now considering the next steps, in consultation with the families of the pilot and passenger, and the police.”","Mr. Sala’s family had commissioned a private search after the authorities ended their search of the Channel’s surface and small islands on Jan. 24. David Barker, the harbormaster of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement at the time, “The chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote.”","Mr. Sala, 28, a prolific goal scorer for Nantes in the French league, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City and was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day.","The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart.","After the authorities ended their search, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala’s sister, pleaded with the authorities not to call it off.","“Please, please, please don’t stop the search,” Ms. Sala said at a news conference in Cardiff, fighting back tears.",She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.,A Facebook message to Mr. Sala’s sister seeking comment was not immediately answered on Sunday night.,"People from all over the world — including soccer stars like Kylian Mbappé, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year — chipped in to help the family’s search.","Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Jan. 25 that by Sunday evening had raised more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000.","Geo Ocean III departed Ostend, a coastal city in Belgium, on Sunday morning to begin a three-day underwater search, the A.A.I.B. tweeted. The search area was to cover about four square miles, according to the BBC.","On Sunday evening, after the wreckage was discovered in the English Channel, Mr. Mearns told Sky News: “This is about the best result we could’ve hoped for the families, but tonight they’ve heard devastating news.”"
Swedish Female Soccer Players Call for Unity to Tackle Inequality - The New York Times,"STOCKHOLM — With 30,000 tickets sold for their friendly against Germany in Stockholm on Saturday, Sweden's female players have called for unity to tackle inequalities between men and women in soccer, especially when it comes to money.","Huge crowds have attended women's games in England, Italy and Spain recently and defender Nilla Fischer told Reuters that fans, players, sponsors and governing bodies would all have to work together to ensure better pay for female players.","""I know that if I'd played in the (German men's) Bundesliga for six years, I wouldn't have any financial worries,"" Fischer said at the team hotel in Stockholm. ","""In terms of percentages, you can't really compare. What they maybe make in an hour, I make in a year,"" the 34-year-old VfL Wolfsburg player added.","The comments come after the U.S. women's team, the world champions, launched a lawsuit against their own federation last month alleging gender discrimination, which includes complaints about wages.","Goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who plays for English club Chelsea, said players campaigning for equality in the women's game would continue to do so once they've hung up their boots.

A 20-0 Soccer Game in Italy Was Men Against Boys - The New York Times,"For the most part, Sunday’s results from Serie C, the third level of Italian soccer, look like those of any other league around the world: Albissola 1, Arezzo 2. Alessandria 0, Arzachena 1. Cuneo 20, Pro Piacenza 0.","Wait, what?","That eye-popping score, and it’s not a typo, is part of a larger tale. Pro Piacenza 1919 is a venerable team from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. But the team has run into financial troubles, and most of its players and staff members, sick of not getting paid, walked out weeks ago.","The team was penalized 8 points by the federation, dropping it to the rock bottom of the standings, and forfeited three straight matches.",One more forfeit and the team could be disqualified from the league.,"So for Sunday’s visit to Cuneo, it was imperative that some kind of team be produced. Pro Piacenza, known as the Rossoneri, or Redblacks, scrambled. It mustered up some teenagers from the youth team, and a team masseur, for a total of eight players. The masseur’s number was hastily added to his uniform with tape. One of the youngsters, Nicola Cirigliano, was appointed the player-manager.","Unfortunately one of the players, identified by the Italian press as Isufi, had forgotten his ID card and could not suit up, leaving the team with just seven players, the minimum allowed before an automatic forfeit.","The game progressed as you would expect with seven inexperienced players going against 11. Cuneo passed at will, dribbled at will, and more or less scored at will. A highlight video is great viewing if you enjoy discouraged players trudging back to the center circle after yet another goal. Cuneo went into the break up by 16-0.","Good news for Pro Piacenza: Isufi’s father retrieved his identifying documents, allowing him to join the game. Bad news for Pro Piacenza: the masseur had to leave the game with a cramp.","In the end, Cuneo let up a bit, leading to the 20-0 final score.","Hicham Kanis wound up with six goals, Edoardo Defendi had five, and hat tricks by Francesco De Stefano and Michele Emmausso were almost unnoticed.","To be clear, although Serie C is a far cry from Juventus, the Milan giants and the high-quality play of Serie A, it is still a fully organized soccer league.","Pisa, in the same division as Pro Piacenza, draws an average of 5,000 fans a game. The winner of the division will head up to Serie B, only a level below the likes of Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Ciro Immobile.","But several teams at this level have struggled financially, among them Cuneo, the winning team Sunday. Matera has missed four matches and been disqualified.",The Italian press did not like what it saw.,"La Gazzetta dello Sport called the match grotesque, “one of the saddest and surreal pages of Italian professional football.”","Even a player on the winning side was embarrassed. “I feel only shame for those who made all this possible,” Fabiano Santacroce said.","Francesco Ghirelli, the Serie C president, told Radio Rai that a game like that “must never happen again.”","And on Monday he made sure it wouldn’t: Lega Pro, the governing body for Serie C, announced on Monday that Pro Piacenza had been kicked out of the league."
"Film in His Blood, a Soccer Revolution in His Plans - The New York Times","The trick, with Aurelio De Laurentiis, is to sit and to wait. He tends to take the scenic route through a conversation; his answers come wrapped in anecdotes and parables, laced with riddles and rhetorical questions.","There are times when you wonder if he has taken one detour too many, become so distracted by his own tangents that he has lost his thread. Listening back, it is hard to pinpoint how, exactly, a question about the Champions League’s revenue distribution leads to a brief but powerful homily about the dangers of the ‘Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, but it does.","It is, though, no great ordeal. De Laurentiis might be most famous now as owner of S.S.C. Napoli, the Italian soccer team he rescued from oblivion and painstakingly restored to Europe’s head table, but he is still, at heart, a film producer, a showman. He knows how to weave together a story, how to craft a compelling pitch. And when he gets to his destination, as he always does, it is invariably worth it.","De Laurentiis is, after all, never knowingly short of ideas on how to revolutionize soccer, never without a sacred cow to slaughter, never without a tradition to overhaul. He has, at various times in the recent past, suggested cutting games from 90 minutes to 60 and advocated the effective abolition of UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, instead handing power directly to Europe’s biggest clubs.","He is also never lacking an adversary, some villain standing in the way of progress, holding the game back through lack of imagination. His list has previously included not only UEFA but FIFA, Adidas, Nike, collective television deals and the Italian political establishment, among others. Many others.","He does all this with a relish and a frequency befitting the scion of one of Italy’s great cinematic dynasties. In his eyes, soccer (and life, most likely) is entertainment. Creating a stir comes naturally. It is all part of the show.","Sitting in a hotel in Liverpool, England, in December, on the eve of what would turn out to be Napoli’s final Champions League game this season, he did not require a vast amount of assistance, then, to land upon his current bête noire.","He would like, he said, to change the way prize money is handed out by the major leagues. He thinks underperformance should not be rewarded. Rather, he thinks it should be punished. “You finish first, you get €100 million, for example,” he says. “You finish second, you earn €50 million, and so on. But if you finish last, you pay a fine.”","This has been a recurrent theme for De Laurentiis this season. He has singled out Frosinone — a minor team from a town between Rome and Naples, promoted to Italy’s top league, Serie A, for only the second time in its history last year — as an example of a club that arrives in the top flight “already relegated.”","Clubs like Frosinone do not draw fans, or interest, or broadcasters to the league, De Laurentiis says. They come up, they do not try to compete, and they go back down, except with their coffers stuffed by what he sees as an unwarranted share of the division’s television revenue.","“The problem is the small teams have the same rights as the big ones,” he said, adding, with a reference to a type of bread: “Why should Frosinone have a season in Serie A, be given a slice of the pagnotta and then be relegated back to the third division? If they cannot compete, if they finish last, they should have to pay a fine. They shouldn’t be given money for failing.”","After yet another tangent in which he dismisses an overmatched club in a major league as a mere “sparring partner,” he quickly builds up a head of steam. “Promotion and relegation is the biggest idiocy in soccer,” De Laurentiis says. “Especially when you also have UEFA trying to force clubs to comply with financial fair play rules. Clubs should be structured geographically, so they can all be self-sufficient. If they cannot survive financially, if they cannot be self-sufficient, they should be booted out.”","It would be easy to listen to De Laurentiis’s words, to hear the many and varied ways in which he feels soccer has gotten things wrong, and to assume that he holds it in contempt, that he has wearied of the sport in the 15 years or so since he bought up what remained of Napoli — “just the name,” he has said previously — and set about reinvigorating it.","His actions, though, are rather different. De Laurentiis is not distancing himself from soccer; rather, he is embedding himself more deeply in it. He has, for several years, been seeking to add another club to his portfolio; ideally, he would have liked one in London. “We never found the occasion,” he said.","He switched his attentions to the United States, investigating an offer to buy an expansion franchise in Major League Soccer. He spent months examining proposals in Baltimore, Detroit and Las Vegas, he said, but was put off by the cost of a team — more than $150 million, plus the cost of a new stadium, in the last expansion round.","Then, in August, De Laurentiis received a phone call from the mayor of Bari, a port city in Apulia, down near Italy’s boot heel. The local club, which played in Serie A as recently as 2011, had been declared bankrupt and had been relegated to the fourth tier of Italian soccer. The mayor offered De Laurentiis the chance to buy it.","“I was surprised,” he said. “I don’t know anyone in Bari. I have barely ever been there.”","More surprising still, however, is that De Laurentiis eventually said yes. Napoli and Bari are, strictly speaking, rivals, but suddenly the same family owned them: the older De Laurentiis in charge of the former, and his son, Luigi, given control of the latter.","It was not, needless to say, a universally popular move. Though Bari’s fans were broadly welcoming — “They saw we were serious people,” Aurelio De Laurentiis said — there was dissent in Naples. “Get out of our city,” read one banner, slung from railings in the city the night the Bari purchase was announced.","De Laurentiis insists that owning another team will not draw his focus from his first love. “Napoli is Napoli, Bari is Bari,” he said. His son, meanwhile, is adamant that the expertise he and his father have gleaned on the Tyrrhenian coast now can be applied on the Adriatic.","“We started from zero,” Luigi said of Bari. “We had to create the brand, starting with a new crest, and then do all of the things necessary for a team: a season-ticket campaign, a website, the marketing, the social media, the jerseys, finding sponsors.”","The rationale, the younger De Laurentiis said, is obvious. “Bari has a national appeal; we are the only team in our division being broadcast nationally,” he said, the result of a partnership with the streaming service DAZN. Apulia itself has seen a boom in tourism in recent years; the opportunity, the younger De Laurentiis said, was too good to ignore.","The plan, needless to say, is to restore Bari to the top flight, even if that would create a battle with the game’s authorities over whether two teams in the same competition can have the same ownership.","“Bari is a recognizable brand,” Luigi said. “It is not Frosinone. It has played in Serie A. It has a long list of famous former players.”","It is not the sort of team, in other words, that Aurelio De Laurentiis would denounce as a sparring partner, a club whose only purpose is to pad out the standings and to pick up a paycheck. De Laurentiis might compulsively court controversy. He might prod and poke and provoke his rivals, and soccer’s authorities. He might do it all in the name of entertainment. He is, though, as good as his word. Bari is putting his money where his mouth is. He thinks soccer needs to change. So he is trying to change it."
"At Yale, a Once Respected Soccer Coach Becomes an Enigma - The New York Times","As Rudy Meredith was inducted into the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame in January to honor his 24-year run as Yale women’s soccer coach, he sprinkled his hallmark humor and humility throughout his remarks.","He recounted how his wife was on the opposite sideline for the University of Hartford when they met in the early 2000s. And he saluted several people in the audience while repeatedly expressing “thankfulness,” recalled Bill Duffy, a middle school principal and soccer lifer who served as master of ceremonies.","There was nothing in Mr. Meredith’s words, Mr. Duffy said, “that would refer to anything that was going on.”","Despite Mr. Meredith’s placid demeanor, people who knew him best had recently begun to detect changes in his behavior. He seemed to be more anxious. He appeared less enthusiastic about soccer, even before he resigned as Yale’s coach in November. He paid little attention to recruiting. He played poorly in pickleball, a paddle sport he usually excelled at.","In hindsight, those hints of stress and fatigue coincided with revelations that Mr. Meredith, 51, had been the linchpin of a sprawling federal investigation into corrupt college admissions schemes that exploded into public view this week.","At the heart of the scandal was a consultant, William Singer, who took $25 million to help fix exam scores or fraudulently misclassify prospective students as recruited athletes to boost their chances of being admitted to elite colleges. But the person who led federal authorities to Mr. Singer, according to court papers filed on Tuesday, was Mr. Meredith.","In a Boston hotel on April 12, 2018, Mr. Meredith solicited a $450,000 bribe from the parent of a prospective college student in exchange for saving a Yale soccer recruitment spot for his daughter. Mr. Meredith took $2,000 from the parent, and directed the parent to wire future payments to a bank account in Connecticut. But the F.B.I. was secretly recording the conversation, the charging documents said. Then six days later, the parent, who was working with the authorities, wired $4,000 to Mr. Meredith from a bank account in Boston that the F.B.I. controlled, giving the government evidence of wire fraud.","With the authorities on to Mr. Meredith, he told them about a deal he had struck in November 2017, when Mr. Singer had introduced him to a man who wanted his daughter to attend Yale. Mr. Singer helped doctor the application to make it seem as though she was the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California, even though she did not play at that level, according to the government documents. But Mr. Meredith told the admissions office he wanted to recruit her, and after she was admitted, Mr. Singer paid the coach $400,000.","Late Friday, Yale released a statement in which it said one student involved in the scheme was admitted and is attending now, while the other was denied admission. In the statement, Peter Salovey, the university president, called the criminal actions “an affront to our community’s deeply held values of fairness, inclusion and honesty.” Mr. Salovey said the university was starting an internal investigation into its admissions process.","Prosecutors said on Tuesday that Mr. Meredith had agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud, honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.","Mr. Meredith did not respond to a request for comment. Paul Thomas, Mr. Meredith’s lawyer, who works at a New Haven firm founded by Felice Duffy, a former Yale soccer coach who later became a federal prosecutor and lawyer, declined to comment.","It was a dramatic fall for a man considered to be a Yale institution. Mr. Meredith started as an assistant coach in 1992, rose to head coach in 1995 and led the team to its first unshared Ivy League title in 2005.","The charges blindsided virtually everyone who knew Mr. Meredith, according to interviews with more than a dozen former players and others connected to Yale or soccer. Mr. Meredith was generous and well liked, and did not appear to have any health, financial or personal problems.","“I’m both appalled and sympathetic — I would never have thought that he was capable of doing this,” said Sharon Eisen, a veterinarian who became friendly with the Merediths in recent years through pickleball, in which Mr. Meredith is a national-level player and coach. “On the one hand, I know them and like them personally. But on the other hand, I’ve lost all respect. So greedy. So immoral.”","Mr. Meredith grew up modestly in the Rockville, Md., area, and was an all-state soccer player at Richard Montgomery High School. But he failed classes while at Montgomery College, and almost quit school. After undergoing tests at the urging of his coach and being found to have a learning disability, he turned his life around, and ultimately transferred to Southern Connecticut State. The university’s men’s soccer program was then a Division II powerhouse. Mr. Meredith played on the 1990 N.C.A.A. championship team, then embarked on a career coaching soccer and teaching physical education.","Robert Kehoe, director of college programs for the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, said he first met Mr. Meredith in 1996 and worked closely with the Yale women’s team for the next several years as part of a development workshop he used to conduct.","“He had a lot of credibility because he was a very good player in his own right,” Mr. Kehoe said.","Mr. Meredith quickly fostered an energetic atmosphere. He required players to wear costumes for Halloween practice. He bought bagels and extra food on his own dime for long bus rides to away games, while good-naturedly enduring the film “Dirty Dancing” at his players’ behest.","Yale enjoyed success in the mid-2000s, with the 2005 team reaching the third round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, knocking out third-seeded Duke in the process. Mr. Meredith coached several Ivy League players of the year and an all-American second-teamer who was profiled by ESPN. Meredith Speck, class of 2015, was the first Yale player in the National Women’s Soccer League, according to Yale's alumni magazine.","“The thing I remember is how professionally he treated us,” said Theryn Gibbons, who was a member of Meredith’s first recruiting class in 1996 and now ranks third on Yale’s scoring list. “Refs were calling me Babe, and Rudy was never like that — we were athletes. He was very respectful, very sensitive.”","If anything, Ms. Gibbons said, Mr. Meredith sometimes seemed intimidated by the aura of Yale, and tried hard to be liked.","“He’s not sophisticated by any means, and I know he would defer to people who he thought were smarter,” said Ms. Gibbons, who later became a federal prosecutor. “He’s very trusting, and gullible for sure.”","She added, “I’m not condoning what is alleged, but he’s family, and you stand by family.”","Mr. Meredith’s wife, Eva Bergsten Meredith, was also a familiar presence at Yale soccer events. A former national team player for Sweden, she is the longtime women’s soccer coach at Wesleyan, and has also run, with her husband, Bulldog Cardinal soccer camp for many years.","In 2013, in what former players said was an unusual move, the Yale women’s coaching position itself was endowed in Mr. Meredith’s name, thanks to an anonymous donation: For a time, Rudy Meredith was the Rudolph L. Meredith Head Coach of Women’s Soccer. Even after Mr. Meredith’s resignation in November, the name stuck: When Brendan Flaherty was hired as Mr. Meredith’s replacement the next month, it was as the Loring Family and Rudolph L. Meredith Head Coach of Women’s Soccer.","Now, Mr. Flaherty is listed on Yale’s website as simply the Loring Family coach. It was not immediately clear when or why Yale made the change. A university spokesman said Mr. Meredith was not involved in funding and naming the position.","In recent years, Yale’s teams did not perform as well as they had in the 2000s, and players and friends began to suspect that Mr. Meredith was no longer as gung-ho about soccer.","Adele Jackson-Gibson, a Yale goalkeeper who graduated in 2013 and is now a freelance writer in Brooklyn, said she “could feel people become more defeated over time.” She added, “People seem tired and a little bit checked out.”","Some players, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to be ensnared in the investigation, also began to notice a player or two, every couple of years, who did not belong on a Division I team, based on their skill level. Some of those players came from wealthy families, prompting speculation that their parents had donated money in exchange for coveted recruiting spots.","In August 2017, the Merediths purchased a vacation home in Fernandina Beach, Fla., for $125,000, and took out a construction loan for $359,250, records show. The next month, Mr. Meredith was badly shaken, friends say, by the unexpected death of Fritz Rodriguez, a longtime assistant coach who had been Mr. Meredith’s roommate and teammate in college. So his resignation in November 2018 did not come as a complete surprise to some.","What few knew, of course, was that he had been cooperating with federal authorities for roughly half a year.",A Yale spokesman said the university learned about the scheme and the federal investigation only after the announcement that he was leaving.,"Mr. Duffy, the M.C. at the Hall of Fame ceremony, summed up the feelings of many people close to Mr. Meredith when he said that he was still processing the gravity of the scandal.","“In the soccer community, we’re saddened by Rudy’s personal involvement, whatever that may be,” he said. “I think more people are angry that more deserving players were overlooked.”"
Fiery Deaths of 10 Boys Exposes Brutality of Brazil’s Soccer Mills - The New York Times,RIO DE JANEIRO — Even in death the haggling went on.,Christian Esmério was going to be the one — his family had been sure of it.,"He was 15 and towering, a soccer player with an easy smile that belied his prowess between the goal posts. Already there was talk of contracts, and of buying a home for his parents, who had poured all their savings into the dream that their son might be the next great Brazilian soccer export — the next Ronaldo, Ronaldinho or Neymar.","Now, his father stood in a daze of grief outside a Rio office building, surrounded by lawyers. Just days earlier, Christian had burned to death in a fire at the youth academy of one of South America’s most famous soccer clubs, Flamengo. He was one of 10 players killed.","The deaths lifted the veil over international soccer’s biggest production line, and raised sweeping questions about a brutal apparatus that chews up untold numbers of young Brazilian boys for every star it mints.","But for the moment, as lawyers sparred over how much money families of the players killed in the blaze should get, there was just one simple question: What was Christian worth?",“Dreams.”,The word hung in the air as Rafael Stival let out a sigh.,"Mr. Stival’s for-profit talent scouting operation had posted a note on Facebook mourning three of its graduates who had died in the fire at Flamengo. Since then, the messages had been pouring in.","They were not condolences. The Facebook post had inadvertently acted as an advertisement — a signal to ambitious parents that Mr. Stival’s organization could get their boys into not just any club, but the great Flamengo. They wanted Mr. Stival to give their boys a chance.","The soccer world in Brazil is populated by a variety of actors, some drawn by glory, but almost all attracted by the chance of breaking out of poverty, maybe even striking it rich.","There are the boys, of course, and their families. There are the investors and the middlemen like Mr. Stival, who trawl the continent-size country in search of prospects as young as 9. And there are the teams, many in a state of such financial disarray that only the sale of the latest star keeps them afloat.","The profits from investing wisely, and early, in even a single player can run into the tens of millions of dollars.","To many in the game, the industry has grown out of control. It has morphed from a system intended to develop promising players into an international market whose value is $7 billion a year, according to soccer’s global governing body, FIFA. In this speculative environment, talented young athletes — some of them children — are bought and sold like any other raw material. In Brazil, the best ones are even referred to that way: as “gems.”",No one knows for sure how many boys are in Brazil’s youth soccer system.,"There are no official figures. Estimates range from 12,000 to 15,000, but that is hard to corroborate. The Brazilian soccer federation makes no effort to track players until they turn 16 and become professionals.","But one thing is known: On the night of the Flamengo fire, Feb. 8, more than two dozen boys — most from poor families, and all hoping to achieve a dream — were asleep in a club dormitory.","In a country obsessed with soccer, Flamengo prides itself on being the most popular team, with wealth that is the envy of rivals across South America. But that adoration and power, it appears, may have allowed Flamengo to escape for years any real censure for the treatment of boys in its care.","In 2015, Rio state prosecutors sued Flamengo over the conditions at its training center. The prosecutors cited child-protection failures, declaring the conditions to be “even worse than those currently offered to juvenile delinquents.”","City officials issued an order closing the facility in 2017, but never carried it out, limiting their sanctions to dozens of fines.","In recent years, Flamengo spent millions to upgrade its youth academy. Last year, club officials boasted that the new facilities would be the best in Brazil.","But the dormitory holding 26 sleeping boys on the night of the fire was a makeshift structure, consisting of six steel containers fused together. It had never been inspected, according to local authorities.",Interviews with survivors of the fire and officials who investigated it suggest that a series of failures may have contributed to the boys’ deaths:,"— Federal regulations require at least one caretaker for every 10 boys, but there was no adult present at the time of the fire.",— Survivors said the only exit from the dorm was at its far end. Some of the boys may have been in beds farther away from the exit than the 33-feet limit required by the regulations.,"— The rooms had sliding doors, another violation because they can jam.","— And while each room had a window, the openings were covered with grates.","One boy who was in Christian’s room told investigators their door had stuck when he tried to get out. The boy managed to slide through the window grates. But Christian, a strapping 6-foot-3 goalkeeper, could not. When rescuers got to him, his body was so badly charred he could be identified only through dental records.","Flamengo officials did not respond to interview requests. But in February, its president, Rodolfo Landim, denied knowing about any irregularities when he spoke at a news conference after the fire.","“Our goal is to solve this problem as quickly as possible,” he said.",Soccer is hardly the only industry to attract Brazil’s desperate.,"Sergio Rangel, a journalist who has covered the sport for three decades, says the youth-training system reminds him of the giant gold mine in Serra Pelada. The horrific conditions there were immortalized by the photographer Sebastião Salgado in the 1980s.","Desperately poor men from all over the country swarmed the mine’s open pit, turning over rocks in the hope of finding the nugget that would change their lives.","Soccer has also been a fool’s gold of sorts for many families. Some of them move hundreds, even thousands of miles to enroll their sons in training programs that will sort, scrutinize and, more often than not, reject their child as worthless.","“Pick one up, turn it over, and throw it away if it’s no good,” Mr. Rangel said.","The young men are not just disposable. To those who run the industry, they are often indistinguishable.","That much was clear at a memorial for the 10 players who died at Flamengo. Midway through the service, a team official rushed to cover a large montage of photos of the boys: someone had realized that a player who survived had been mistakenly included.","The streets of Xerém, about 50 kilometers outside Rio, teem with boys of various ages in red, green and white jerseys — the colors of the Fluminense soccer club.","Until the team built its training complex there, Xerém was little more than a swamp, locals say. But now, despite the humid heat that tops 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is home to players and families whose lives revolve around the club.","Among them earlier this year was an 11-year-old nicknamed Maradoninha, for his resemblance to the former Argentine great Diego Maradona. Even in this hotly competitive town, Maradoninha was attracting attention.","Two years ago, a talent scout from Fluminense saw the boy, whose real name is Leandro Gomes Feitosa, play in a local tournament and approached his family. The boy was only 9, and Brazilian law does not allow soccer clubs to house children under 14. But if the family could get to Rio, the scout said, Fluminense would train him."," A group of local businessmen put up the money — for a cut of future proceeds — and the family moved more than 1,200 miles, from the town of Palmas to Xerém, to pursue the dream.","Almost all the families living in their community of 26 rowhouses have a similar story, Maradoninha’s father, Evandro Feitosa, said.","Maradoninha may not be old enough for high school, but he knows his family’s future is tied to his skills with a soccer ball. “God willing,” he said, “I’ll become a big player to help my family in Palmas, my family here and those in need.”","The chances of making it are slim. Fewer than 5 percent of the soccer prospects in Brazil will ever make it as professionals, by most estimates. Fewer still will earn a decent wage in the game. A study published by the Brazilian soccer federation in 2016 found that 82 percent of soccer players in the country earned less than 1,000 reais ($265) each month.","And for Maradoninha and his family, the odds recently got even slimmer: Fluminense released him.","Whatever the odds, whatever the hardship, there are enough soccer success stories to feed the hopes of young boys and families who have little else to aspire to.","There is Neymar, so successful he is more international brand than player. He is the product of a humble neighborhood on the outskirts of São Paulo. There are Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Romário, three former Brazilian World Cup winners, all awarded the title of best player in the world in their time by FIFA.","And most recently, there is Vinicius Junior, a flashy forward who rose out of Flamengo’s youth ranks. He once trained on the same fields as the 10 boys killed in the fire, and then he began living the dream: in 2017, when he was 16, Spain’s Real Madrid agreed to pay 45 million euros (just over $50 million) for his rights after he played just 11 minutes in his debut game.","All of those players, and hundreds more, have emerged from the Brazil’s soccer mill to ply their trade on the world’s biggest stages.","In his early days in the sport, Christian’s parents used all they had — and borrowed from friends and neighbors — to finance his soccer dream.","He seemed to be getting closer to his own version of the soccer success story. On March 5, the day he turned 16, he was expected to sign his first professional contract at Flamengo. His dream, years in the making, was in reach.",He died four weeks before that birthday.,"Days after his death, his father, Cristiano Esmério, was standing outside an office tower in downtown Rio where public defenders were meeting with officials from Flamengo. He was with a group of lawyers. One turned to him.","When it came to compensation, the lawyer said, it would be unfair if Christian's family was treated the same as the others. After all, he said, some of the dead boys had been recent arrivals to the club. But Christian was different: He had been called up to one of Brazil’s youth national teams. Clearly he was worth more than the rest.","Esmério nodded silently. He and his son had discussed money, too.","“Dad, let’s look for a house,” he recalls Christian saying when he got word that he was closing in on a professional contract. “My first paycheck, I want to pay for a house for my mom, so she doesn’t have to suffer because she doesn’t have water or electricity.”","A week before he died, the boy posted a tribute to his family on Facebook. Above two pictures of father and son taken a decade apart, he made a promise:","“All the sacrifice will be compensated, my old man.”"
Women Finally Get Their Own World Cup Soccer Style - The New York Times,"The United States women’s soccer team has been fighting for gender parity not just in the courts — suing the United States Soccer Federation last week for discrimination — but also in their uniforms, known as kits. And at least when it comes to the clothes and the Women’s World Cup, they have won.","On Monday, at a global event in Paris, Nike revealed the new home and away uniforms for 14 out of 24 competing teams, and for the first time since the brand began working with the WWC tournament in 1995, each one of them was made specifically for the women’s teams, not as derivations or extensions of kits made for men. Three days before, to coincide with International Women’s Day, Adidas released its new designs for four WWC teams.","In the larger picture of gender issues and sports, this may not seem like a big deal. But the clothes athletes wear speak loudly about identity and allegiance, and have the power to help instill confidence. Clothes are also the easiest way for fans to assert their own allegiance, aspiration and personal connection. They are, above all, symbols. And now they are finally symbols of parity.","“We are shifting more resources to women,” said Amy Montagne, the vice president for global categories at Nike — and not just because this is the largest number of teams the company has worked with. (It outfitted 11 clubs for the 2015 Women’s World Cup.) But because, Mark Parker, the chief executive, said, “We believe this summer can be another turning point for the growth of women’s football.”","Certainly, given Nike’s current emphasis on women’s sports — the Dream Crazier campaign, a series of new initiatives designed to support women’s coaching and engage more girls — as well as its own experience with Serena Williams and the current focus on female dress in the competitive arena, it would have been fairly hypocritical for the company to treat its women’s soccer kit as in any way secondary to men’s. (Especially given Nike’s own somewhat uncomfortable internal history with gender issues.)",Yet it wasn’t until 2015 that Nike began making women’s soccer jerseys in men’s sizes so that more male fans could buy them. And it wasn’t until the players really spoke up that things began to change.,"“Three years ago they said, ‘We want our own thing,’” Cassie Looker, the senior apparel product manager for global football, said in a call from France. “Their own thing” refers to both fit and to the design of the uniforms, which Nike refers to as the “storytelling.”","According to Ms. Looker, the fit took three years and multiple four-dimensional body mapping sessions of professional athletes to adjust. “They are shaped differently than the standard body type,” she said. “They generate most of their power from their lower body.”","While male soccer players like a slimmer fit — “It makes them feel more powerful, like superheroes,” Ms. Looker said — women are more interested in comfort and “looking professional.” This meant a lot of focus on the length of the sleeve (the athletes did not want to expose too much of their upper arms) and the neckline, which ended up halfway between a V-neck and a crew neck, with enough give to be easily pulled over a ponytail. ","“They want zero distractions,” she said.","Most of this may be lost on the armchair soccer fan, though the storytelling implicit in the design will not. (In any case, the kits are available in two fits: athlete and “stadium,” or looser, for the weekend fan.) Though the kits rely on the color palettes of national flags, the difference is often in the pixelated details. ","“Chile, France, U.S.A. — they are all red, white and blue,” Ms. Looker said, which can make them hard to distinguish. “We bring it up all the time internally.”","What to expect? The United States jerseys have a throwback patriotism with (in the home kit) direct references to the jerseys worn by the 1999 team that transformed the profile of women’s soccer in America: white, with red and blue stripes on the sleeves. ","The names of the 50 states are printed in gray on the back, and three stars over the crest nod to the three championships the United States has won. The away kit has tonal abstractions of stars and stripes on red (though they read a little blotchy from afar).","Also tonal are the roses and assorted other florals on the four burgundy-red quadrants of the England jerseys, which is why France’s hexagonal blue polka dots on white stand out, as does the Norwegian snowflake pattern that fades from red to blue, giving their home jersey an Empire-waist effect and uniting the shorts and top.","By athlete request Chile, Nigeria, South Africa and Korea have the same pattern that the men’s teams wore in the 2018 World Cup, though the fit has been customized for the women. (At least in Nigeria’s case, the look was so successful that you can kind of understand why they didn’t want to mess with a good thing.)","And then there’s Australia. Of all 14 Nike team looks, this will likely be the most controversial; a canvas of forest green, mustardy gold and white slashes and splotches that looks sort of like animal print meets modern art landscape painting. ","Together with the Sweden kit, by Adidas, which features the faces of female role models chosen by the players embedded in the numbers on the back of each jersey, it makes a statement that, on the pitch or the street, will be impossible to miss.

It’s an Anti-Fascist Thing: How an Obscure German Soccer Team Gained a Brooklyn Cult - The New York Times,"In a dive bar underneath the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, fans of an obscure soccer team gathered after an entire workday of information blackout. They spent their Tuesday avoiding calls from family members and social media in its entirety because they didn’t want to spoil the outcome of a match that technically ended long ago, halfway across the world in Germany.","When their team scored what would be their only goal of the game, the supporters chanted raucously for “the boys in brown,” thrusting their pints in the air, none the wiser that it was, as it frequently has been, already a lost cause.","“One of the biggest crimes you could commit with this group is to mention you know the outcome,” said Karl Paranya, who lives in the neighborhood and has been watching the matches since he first stumbled into East River Bar about seven years back. “It can be a bit awkward because our cries don’t do anything for a team that finished eight hours ago, but it feels the same for us.”","The team they follow is F.C. St. Pauli, a tiny club whose games no cable soccer package broadcasts live; it would be like expecting to find an Orlando Solar Bears hockey game on ESPN.","But what draws Mr. Paranya and the rest of the supporters here is the team’s unusual politics: F.C. St. Pauli is an avowed anti-fascist soccer team based in Hamburg that plays in Germany’s second division and hasn’t won the title in more than 40 years, though it runs a kindergarten inside the stadium, which displays signs proclaiming “no person is illegal.” The club has a worldwide, international fandom that defines itself in opposition to the racism and violence that characterizes European football hooliganism.","The East River Pirates, as they’re known, are still only maybe one of 10 supporters’ groups in North America, and the only official one in the city. As such, East River Bar has become an unlikely spiritual home for German tourists, as well as a set of extremely devoted American fans who are far more interested in the team for their politics than whether or not they’re in possession of the ball at any given time.","“It’s not like we’re that invested in the game play or the results,” said Shawn Roggenkamp, age 32, who helps coordinate the loose gathering of fans. “But it is a reason for us to get together every week and bring this group of people together who maybe wouldn’t have found each other any other way.”","East River Bar, which began as paint factory and was also a biker hangout in a previous life, was purchased about 15 years ago by Marek Gregorski, a Polish expatriate. His intention was originally to serve food, though he said the money for that part of the business fell through. The cheap drinks, cavernous space, and location next to the Williamsburg Bridge soon attracted a specific clientele, which Mr. Gregorski happily catered to. “At some point we started to get some bike messengers, more and more of them, and we became a staple for hosting messengers and their parties,” Mr. Gregorski said. “They get off work, and this is their first stop to get a beer and relax a little bit.”","The Pirates, who celebrated their 10th anniversary this past November, were initially regarded as oddballs at East River, which is decidedly not a sports bar, unless you count billiards or biking. Out front, there’s a sign featuring an enormous gear and a vending machine selling spare inner tubes. The backyard has communal grills for customer barbecues in warm weather. The inside is sparsely decorated, and being a classic dive, contains only a couple of tiny televisions that are always on but no one pays much attention to. A regular game day will bring a mix of bike punks, New York soccer heads, and Germans on a pilgrimage to watch St. Pauli on a giant projector screen instead.","Ms. Roggenkamp, who works for the auction house Christie’s, was introduced to the cult of St. Pauli about five years ago when she was studying German through a private program. A classmate took her to watch a game at East River. Over the next year and a half, she slowly started to take on a leadership role in the supporters’ club. In keeping with the team’s philosophy, that typically involves passing a collection cup for charity during halftime. The ritual takes on an air of communion — a characterization that Ms. Roggenkamp agrees with.","“I was having a conversation about it with one of my friends the other day,” she said. “And he was like, ‘You talk about this as if it’s your church group.’”","Jah Jah Brown, half of the Brooklyn-based rap duo known as Ninjasonik, has been coming to watch games at East River Bar for the past six years because he’s enamored with the team’s politics. He said that German tourists regularly walk into the bar, which is typically full of bicycles, and have to ask, “Are we in the right spot?”","In fact, the bar is a bridge between the two nations. Mr. Paranya remembered being with a Turkish friend years ago and lamenting that he didn’t have a geographical allegiance to a soccer team as an American. The friend immediately pegged him as a would-be St. Pauli fan, though the comment was initially forgotten. Years later, he and his wife popped into East River Bar for a beer, where a game happened to be screening. After about five minutes, he realized who was playing. “I remembered that I was supposed to like these guys,” Mr. Paranya said. “By the end of the game I was singing all the songs and had purchased a T-shirt.” A few years later, he took a trip to Germany, which he described as a pretense to visit St. Pauli’s stadium. He wore his supporters shirt and made about “20 new best friends,” some of which he now sees occasionally when they come to visit the United States and make their obligatory trip to Williamsburg.","With about 10 minutes left in the game that Tuesday, the other team scored, though not many fans seemed to notice. When they sunk another goal and things seemed good and over, one of the Pirates’ organizers, Sören Thode, switched the broadcast to a YouTube video of the German entertainer Hans Albers’s ode about the Reeperbahn — the red-light district district of working-class Hamburg. People finished their beers and said their goodbyes until the next match on Monday afternoon, though they, of course, wouldn’t be watching until nightfall."

"Dorm Fire Kills 10 Young Players in Brazil, Sending Shudder Through Soccer World - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO — Fire consumed a dormitory early Friday at a Brazilian training center for teenage soccer players run by one of South America’s most prominent teams, killing at least 10 in a disaster that reverberated through the soccer world and beyond.","The fire in the dormitory, which may have been constructed improperly on what was intended to be a parking lot, was the latest in a string of seemingly preventable tragedies that have convulsed Brazil over the past two weeks.","It struck the training center of the Flamengo club in Rio de Janeiro, breaking out in the early morning when many youth players, ages 14 to 17, were asleep. Three others were injured, one seriously, and were taken to a hospital.","Officials would not confirm the identities of the dead. But Globoesporte, a Brazilian sports news website, said all were players. The dorm housed 26 players and 13 escaped unharmed, the website said.","“The location was completely consumed in flames,” Douglas Henaut, a lieutenant with firefighters, told journalists at the scene. “Unfortunately, we weren’t able to rescue anyone inside. As much as we tried to enter and locate the victims, it wasn’t possible. The bodies were found totally charred.”",Flamengo is one of Brazil’s most popular soccer clubs and is considered a symbol of the country’s global dominance in the training and development of young athletes who aspire to join professional soccer.,"Some of Brazil’s biggest stars have played with Flamengo, among them Romário, Ronaldinho and Zico, who represented the country in World Cups, and many others who have played for high-profile teams abroad.","The club’s training center, known as Ninho do Urubu, or Vulture’s Nest, in the western part of the city, had recently undergone renovations. Rio officials confirmed local news reports that the dormitory had been erected in what was supposed to be a parking lot, with no permits for construction, and was going to be torn down after the occupants moved into a new dorm.","“The fire was in my room,” Felipe Cardoso, 15, who plays for the Flamengo youth team, wrote on Twitter. “I have only God to thank for managing to wake up and escape death, may God comfort my brothers.”","For players accepted to the youth team, it was the Brazilian equivalent of joining the Dallas Cowboys. A video posted by a team member who was away when the fire erupted showed their exuberant camaraderie in the dorm.","President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who is hospitalized after intestinal surgery, posted a condolence message on social media: “This morning we were made aware of the sad tragedy in the Flamengo training center, taking the young lives of those who were beginning the path toward the realization of their professional dreams.”","Firefighters said they were alerted to the blaze at 5:17 a.m. local time, and Rio de Janeiro prosecutors said they had created a task force to investigate the cause.","The fire comes two weeks after a dam broke in the most lethal mining disaster in Brazil’s history, and just two days after a powerful summer storm in Rio de Janeiro set off flooding and mudslides, killing six.",The disasters have shocked and saddened Brazilians and have highlighted the country’s shoddy infrastructure and poor emergency response.,"“We are seeing a succession of avoidable, preventable facts and disasters, and we must pay attention to them so that the institutions of control, enforcement and punishment really work in Brazil,” the country’s prosecutor general, Raquel Dodge, said in Brasília, the capital, after news of the fire spread.","The blaze also focused attention on living conditions for young Brazilian soccer players, many of whom come from underprivileged backgrounds and live in dormitories like Flamengo’s across the vast country.","“It’s hard to imagine what Flamengo means for these boys,” said Juca Kfouri, a Brazilian sports columnist and author. “In Brazil, there are only two legal paths to social improvement for them: entertainment and soccer. Otherwise it’s a life of crime.”","Mr. Kfouri said he was not familiar with the dormitory at the Flamengo training ground, but he said that living conditions at soccer clubs in Brazil historically were atrocious — including a case in which boys were housed in one dormitory built underneath the stands and another infested with rats.","“Training at Flamengo is realizing your life’s goal,” Mr. Kfouri said. “But now it’s a dream turned into a nightmare.”","He added that the death toll in the fire was most likely lower than it could have been because training had been suspended after the widespread flooding in Rio, and some boys had gone home.","Zico, one of Brazil’s soccer legends, sent reporters a video lamenting the tragedy. He said he had met some of the boys who died in the fire. “We ended up getting close to them,” he said. “Boys with dreams, goals, a lot of them trying to help their families.”","Rival clubs expressed sympathy on social media. The messages included one from Chapecoense, which suffered its own tragedy just over two years ago when a plane carrying team members to an international competition ran out of fuel and crashed, killing nearly all of the 77 people on board.","One of soccer’s most recent breakout stars, the Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior, who was developed in Flamengo’s youth ranks and lived at the academy, took to Twitter to express his horror at the fire. He wrote that he was in shock and called for prayers.","While Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, is known for its exports of meat, metal and coffee, nothing garners as much attention as the soccer players it dispatches at a rate unmatched anywhere.","Brazilian players form the backbone of soccer’s $7 billion player trading industry. Last year alone 832 players left on overseas adventures, according to data provided by soccer’s global governing body, FIFA.","While a few, like the star forward Neymar, will make it to the biggest stages of the game, most are soccer’s workhorses, providing a Brazilian touch to professional teams from East Timor to the Faroe Islands looking to fill their rosters with reliable, well-coached and relatively inexpensive talent.","Back home in Brazil, rampant inequality and a lack of other opportunities mean, the supply of young, gifted soccer players looking for a way out of grinding poverty is almost limitless.","Flamengo’s newly renovated facility opened late last year, at a cost of about $6 million, and was part of a complete overhaul of the club’s youth development system.","Besides five training fields, a swimming pool and gym facilities, the complex was to contain accommodations for 48 players to live on site: 36 single bedrooms, and six doubles.","Occupants of the dorm that burned had been scheduled to move into a new building next month, according to local news media reports.","Flamengo also had engaged Double Pass, a Belgian consulting firm that specializes in soccer youth development, to modernize the way it trained players.","Alexandre Wrobel, a vice president at the club, has been quoted by Brazilian media as saying the youth training facility it would be among the top five in soccer.","Such modern surroundings remain comparatively rare in South America, where many clubs cannot call on the lucrative television deals and sponsorship arrangements that bankroll teams in Europe."
Marco Reus Has Been Kicked Hard by Soccer. He’s Still Standing. - The New York Times,"DORTMUND, Germany — There are times these days when Marco Reus finds himself in the middle of the field at Borussia Dortmund’s Signal Iduna Park, watching as Jadon Sancho and Jacob Bruun Larsen and Achraf Hakimi tear around him, a blur of yellow and black, and remembering what it was like to be young.","Not that Reus is what most of us would call old; he is not quite what his peers would call old, either. That is how he feels, though. “I am old, my friend,” he said. “In our business, now, when you are 29 or 30, you are old.” He delivers it with a smile, an acknowledgment that he is hamming it up, just a little, but the sentiment is real.","Reus feels old in the sense that he is starkly aware that he is no longer young. He knows that whenever he sees Sancho, Larsen and the rest of Dortmund’s shooting stars, the way they play with boldness and fearlessness. They look to him like “young horses,” wild and free.","Reus knows that feeling well, that glorious weightlessness, unencumbered by thoughts of “what will happen later, what happens after you finish,” the end so distant that you cannot believe it will ever come.","He was like that once, when he was one of the standard-bearers of the new German generation that was going to lift the World Cup in 2014, a winger of pace and cunning and dead-eyed finishing, first with Borussia Mönchengladbach and then as part — a key part — of Jürgen Klopp’s Dortmund team.","He remembers it well enough to know that he no longer has it, that it has disappeared at some point along the way. And yet it is hard to conceive of Reus as a “veteran,” as he puts it. Partly, that is because he does not really look the part. His hair is a little darker than it used to be, no longer colored a bright blond, but his face is still smooth-skinned, and his voice is still soft, boyish. He hardly fits the stereotype of the grizzled, wizened pro.","And partly it is because it feels as if Reus, even on the cusp of his 30th birthday, is still somehow a talent-in-waiting, his potential not yet fully tapped. For a player regarded as one of Europe’s best for much of the last decade, he has an air of one of the sport’s lost boys.","When Dortmund re-signed Reus — he was released from its youth system as a teenager — after its last Bundesliga title, in 2012, he was supposed to be the player who lifted the club to the next level.","Klopp believed Reus represented a scarcely believable bargain — “his real market value is much higher” than the nearly $20 million he cost, he said — while the Dortmund chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, felt Reus might be able to “define an era” for the club, in the way that “Uwe Seeler did at Hamburg and Steven Gerrard at Liverpool.”","Franz Beckenbauer identified him, along with Mario Götze, as Germany’s brightest hopes. The two helped Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final; Reus was penciled in as a starter in Joachim Löw’s Germany team for the 2014 World Cup.","And then, 10 hours before Germany was scheduled to travel to Brazil, Reus tore his ankle ligaments in his final pretournament friendly. He punched the ground in frustration. Germany’s team flew without him. It came home a month later as the world champion.","Reus did his rehab, returned to fitness, seemed ready to break through into the elite once more. Before the European Championship in 2016, Löw said that Reus “hugely enriched” the Germany side. But he missed that tournament through injury, too (Germany reached the semifinals).","Another recovery, another fresh start. In 2017, EA Sports made him the cover star of that year’s edition of its FIFA game, an honor usually afforded to Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo; that was the sort of company Reus was expected to keep. Dortmund made the German Cup final that year. Reus, after so many delays, had the first silverware of his career in his grasp.","He picked up an injury in the first half. At halftime, Dortmund’s doctors informed him that they believed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament, and that he would be sidelined for six months, eight months, maybe more. He called his parents, and his girlfriend, Scarlett, and cried. “It’s bad,” he told them. Dortmund went on to win.","That evening, Reus stopped to talk to reporters. They asked him if he knew the extent of the injury. “It is just a little cruciate,” he told them. Dortmund’s communications team was baffled. There is, they knew, and Reus knew, no such thing as a little cruciate injury.","“Negative experiences teach you what to say,” Reus said, explaining how he could be so relaxed. It was not, though, an act of bravado. He had suffered injuries before, setbacks bad enough that he had once said he would happily trade all of the money he had made during his career for his fitness.","This injury was the worst of all of them, and yet it had, he said, “caused something in my head to accept it.” That is not to say he did not suffer. In the hospital, a couple of days later, “once the adrenaline had worn off,” Reus felt that familiar bleakness setting in. He still had times when he “got emotional, angry, screamed, cried,” but he knew that he had to get it out, get over it, get on with it.","“If it stays inside, you get sad, and you never get to the point where you can make the next step,” he said. “You can be sad for a couple of days, and nobody will be angry with you. But for weeks and months? It does not help.”","He did not, though — not then, not during any of his injuries, not during any of the time that he lost — start to feel he was cursed. He never asked why this was happening to him, why he had so much snatched away from him, why fate seemed arranged that he would remain a what if, one of those players who never quite becomes — through no fault of his own — what he was supposed to be.","“It is human to think about what I have missed,” he said. “But if I regret too much, think about what I have lost, I lose focus on what I need to do. You cannot rewind. This is not a computer game that you can play again. All I can do is try to be better, to be luckier, next time.”","That is not the only change in perspective injury has afforded him. “You have a lot of time to think about other things, too,” he said. Over the eight months of his rehabilitation, Reus — by his own estimation — grew up. “You become aware of what you are doing, and what comes next, and when that will start,” he said.","He turns 30 in May. By that stage, if all goes well, he will have become a father for the first time. He is no longer young, even if he is not quite old. “I have three or four years left,” he said of his playing career. “That is still quite a period, but football goes fast.”","He has made no firm decisions on what he will do when his career ends — he would prefer not to go into senior management, but coach children, if he stays in soccer, because that is when “you should be having the most fun” — though he has a few ideas. He has not forgotten what it is to be footloose, carefree, but that does not mean he envies Sancho, Larsen and his other young teammates. He does not resent the clock for ticking.","“The injuries have taught me to enjoy the time I have on the field, the time I am training with the guys,” he said. “As you get older, you learn it will end at some point, and so you cherish the moments you are healthy.” Those young horses are lucky, he knows, to feel it will never end. But he would not trade places with them. When you know that time is limited, and time is precious, you appreciate it all the more."
Soccer Player Who Faced Extradition From Thailand to Bahrain Is Back in Australia - The New York Times,"A soccer player who was jailed in Thailand and faced being sent back to his native Bahrain, where he said he would be imprisoned and tortured, was released Monday after Thai prosecutors dropped the extradition case against him.","On Tuesday afternoon, the player, Hakeem al-Araibi, arrived back in Australia, where he has refugee status. He was greeted at the airport in Melbourne by a swarm of well-wishers, who started singing, “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” a popular soccer anthem.","“Amazing to see all the people here,” he said. “I’m going to die in Australia. Australia is my country,” he added. “I love Australia.”","Mr. al-Araibi, 25, who had been a star defender for the Bahrain national soccer team, fled the small Gulf nation in 2011 during a crackdown on Arab Spring protesters. He said he had been tortured by government security forces. He has been playing soccer for a minor team in Melbourne, Australia.","After his arrest in November at an airport in Bangkok, he became the focus of lobbying by diplomats, prominent sports figures and a social media campaign under the hashtag #savehakeem.",Mr. al-Araibi left for Australia as soon as his departure was approved.,"“This is the best outcome,” said his lawyer, Natalie Bergman. “It should have happened from the beginning, but later is better than nothing.”","After Mr. al-Araibi’s arrival in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne released a joint statement commending the Thai government for its decision and noting the “constructive dialogue that we have had with Bahrain in helping to resolve this issue.”","The statement added: “We know all Australians will deeply appreciate the decision, allowing him to return to his wife, family and friends.”","Mr. al-Araibi traveled to Thailand last year for a honeymoon and was detained with his wife. She was released, but Mr. al-Araibi remained in detention as Bahrain pursued his extradition.","He had been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison for charges including the burning of a police station, which he said occurred while he was playing in a televised match.","The royal family of Bahrain, which is Sunni Muslim, has pursued an aggressive crackdown against calls for democracy from the kingdom’s Shiite Muslim majority, including a campaign of widespread arrests and many convictions on what human rights groups say are trumped-up charges.","Thailand, which has been run by a military junta since a 2014 coup, has sent people fleeing political oppression back to countries including China, raising fears that Mr. al-Araibi would also be returned.",But the country has also shown signs that it can be moved by international pressure.,"Last month, a Saudi woman who said she was fleeing abuse from her family barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room and rallied support to her cause online. The woman, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, was allowed to leave the airport after a two-day standoff and was granted asylum in Canada.","Mr. al-Araibi received widespread support from the international sports world, including FIFA, the international body that oversees global soccer; the International Olympic Committee; and the World Players Association, an umbrella group representing 85,000 professional athletes worldwide.","Jamie Vardy, a striker for the English Premier League club Leicester City, expressed support for Mr. al-Araibi on Twitter, and Craig Foster, a broadcaster and former captain of the Australian national men’s team, was a prominent advocate for his release.","“This is a big victory for that global campaign and marks the fact that football will have to play an important role in human rights going forward,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “They call football the beautiful game, and it is a beautiful day for the beautiful game.”","Mr. Foster, who lobbied FIFA officials and shouted his support to Mr. al-Araibi when he appeared at a hearing last week in leg shackles, expressed his gratitude to the Thai government for dropping the case.","“Most important thing now is Hakeem’s immediate well-being,” Mr. Foster said on Twitter after the ruling was announced. “Sure embassy staff will take care of him, there’ll be tears there tonight, as there are in our household right now.”","When Mr. al-Araibi arrived in Melbourne, Mr. Foster placed his arms around his shoulders.","“To see him back here on home soil today speaks volumes about the character, the values and the pride that we have as Australians,” Mr. Foster said.","The Thai foreign minister, Don Pramudwinai, visited Bahrain and met on Sunday with Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the crown prince, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported. No details of their discussion were released.","The decision to drop the case came after the government of Bahrain told Thai diplomats that it did not want to pursue it, said Chatchom Akapin, director general for international affairs for the Thai attorney general’s office.","“We got information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning that Bahrain is not interested in extraditing Hakeem anymore,” he said. “Therefore, the attorney general office decided it was no use to pursue the case.”"
Top Qatari Soccer Official Barred From Tournament in U.A.E. - The New York Times,LONDON — The diplomatic standoff between Qatar and its Arab neighbors spilled into the sports world once again Thursday as a Qatari vice president of Asia’s soccer confederation was barred from traveling to the United Arab Emirates ahead of the region’s top tournament.,"Saoud al-Mohannadi, vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, was denied permission to travel from Oman to the U.A.E. after airport officials said he wouldn’t be let into the country. The U.A.E., with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other Mideast countries, broke diplomatic relations and severed all ties with Qatar in 2017.","Mohannadi is the chairman of the A.F.C.’s competitions committee, a group with overall responsibility for the Asian Cup. Prohibiting him from traveling to the U.A.E. is the first sign that long-simmering political tensions in the Gulf are likely to have ramifications for continent’s biggest tournament.","Mohannadi immediately wrote a letter of complaint to Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini royal who is the A.F.C.’s current president. The organization said in a statement that it was aware of reports that Mohannadi was being denied the right to travel and that it would investigate. The A.F.C. said it had been “assured of visas and entry permits” for tournament organizing committee members and executives.","The Saudi-led diplomatic dispute with Qatar included the suspension of flights between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several other countries. Only recently have Qatari citizens been allowed to apply for permission to travel between the two countries. Such travel typically requires a visa and an approval letter from local authorities.","Mohannadi, who in 2017 successfully managed to overturn a one-year FIFA ethics ban, had applied to enter the U.A.E. Local organizers told him he could travel there even though he had not received official clearance, according to people familiar with the matter. He traveled from Doha to Muscat, Oman’s capital, where he was told his clearance was not registered.","The soccer federation in Qatar, which will host the World Cup in 2022, said in a statement that it had reached out to the A.F.C. about the matter. “We will comment further once we have an official response on the incident,” the federation said.","The diplomatic dispute, which exploded in the spring of 2017, has already impacted regional sports. Players and officials on teams from countries opposed to Qatar initially refused to speak to beIN Sports, the Qatari-owned network that owns the rights to the A.F.C.’s events. For much of the past year, BeoutQ, a bootlegging television network, has been unimpeded in broadcasting pirated beIN Sports events using a satellite operator based in Saudi Arabia.",BeoutQ was launched in response to the governments of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. blocking the sale of beIN Sports as part of a blockade that has closed off air and sea access between the countries.,"Mohannadi’s travel plans are unlikely to be the last flashpoint in the 24-team tournament that kicks off on Saturday. The draw, made in May, set up a match between foes Qatar and Saudi Arabia on Jan. 17.

Lionel Messi’s Goals Go Viral Like No Other Player’s - The New York Times,"There is no shortage of Lionel Messi content on the World Wide Web. The 31-year-old soccer superstar ranks high in surveys of top Google searches, one of just a few human beings to earn a spot among such keyword perennials as “Facebook,” “weather” and “free porn.” In a 2015 tally of the most Googled person in each nation on earth, Messi tied Kim Kardashian for the most No. 1s, with a global reach that extended from his native Argentina to Haiti, Turkmenistan, Senegal and 22 other countries.","Messi is also one of the world’s pre-eminent viral video stars. Countless clips document “Messi magic,” a playing style of almost unseemly brilliance. On social media, users share videos of Messi’s slipping passes through improbably tight spaces, corkscrewing shots past sprawling goalkeepers, darting around defenders like a jack rabbit navigating a gantlet of sloths. Type “Messi” into a YouTube search field, and you will find hundreds of highlight compilations with bombastic titles: “Lionel Messi sees things we don’t even consider,” “Lionel Messi: — A God Amongst Men,” “Lionel Messi: Extraterrestrial.”","So it was not exactly surprising when, on March 17, the internet was captivated by a Messi goal. It came in the 85th minute of a 4-1 victory for Messi’s club team, FC Barcelona, over the Seville-based Real Betis. Messi gathered the ball about 24 yards from the Betis goal, slid a pass to his teammate Ivan Rakitić and then flowed forward to receive a return pass. The goal that followed was so easeful, so understated, that it was momentarily hard to process. Messi struck the ball in full stride but with shocking delicacy, lifting a chip shot that arced gracefully across the penalty area. The ball drifted beyond the reach of the goalie, Pau López, scraped the underside of the crossbar and dropped into the goal. Messi had taken his shot from a diagonal position more than 20 yards away, but it was not the stinging kick generally required to score from that spot. The ball’s trajectory was languid and dreamy, like a gull gliding on an ocean breeze.","Messi had already scored twice in the game. But the beauty and impudence of this goal — by some counts, the 656th of Messi’s professional career — was clear to all. Betis supporters stood to applaud their tormentor. Soccer pundits reached for celestial metaphors. On ESPN.com, the journalist Musa Okwonga wrote that “the ball, with the glorious inevitability of our slowly dying sun, rose and fell.” The wildest exultations came from the operatic English TV commentator Ray Hudson, who unleashed a torrent of mixed metaphors. “The staggering genius of Lionel Messi!” he cried, during a live broadcast on the beIN SPORTS network. “This miraculous footballer, this halo of a footballer! ... He’s got an algebraic equation to solve in the blink of a baby’s eye, and he does it in a way that is just so poetic!”","Hudson is onto something with this talk of algebra and poetry. Messi’s greatness lies in his mind as much as his body. Watching replays of the goal, you marvel above all at the audacity of Messi’s idea. A chip? From that distance, at that angle, in that frenzied moment of open-field play? It’s nuts — a fool’s fantasy that blossoms, with every slow-motion replay, into wondrous fact. Messi saw something we didn’t even consider.","That viral clip is a testament to Messi’s supernatural talent. It’s also a reminder that online video is changing the way we consume and conceptualize sports. Decades ago, the culture of “highlights” was already transforming America’s pastimes. The decline of slow-paced baseball, the ascendancy of the razzle-dazzle N.B.A., the rule changes that have brought an offensive explosion in the N.F.L. — these developments were fueled in no small part by the rise of ESPN’s SportsCenter and the primacy of video clips. But in the old days, those highlight packages were appointment viewing, available only on nightly broadcasts. Today highlights spread across the web in seconds, mutating into memes and turning star athletes into visual brands. You don’t have to be a purist to wonder how this media ecosystem is affecting our tolerance for the natural rhythms and longueurs of sports, those lengthy stretches of “lowlight” play that are only occasionally punctuated by thrills.","Soccer is a subtle game; in general, goals are hard to come by. It would seem to be the major sport most antithetical to highlight culture. (For all those moments of Messi magic, the essence of his greatness may lie in untelegenic maneuverings off the ball, the cagey movements that put him into positions where he can erupt.) But viral video is altering our view of soccer’s history. Today’s fans compare clips while endlessly debating the “greatest of all time” status of Messi and his chief rival, the Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo. The GOATs of previous eras — like Pelé, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona — recede into the background: They had the misfortune to play in a time before a footballer’s every exploit was captured on video. If a player’s “receipts” aren’t on YouTube, he’s liable to lose to his toehold in the historiography.","Yet for the 21st-century soccer fan, online video is a godsend — the only conceivable way to keep up with the ultimate global sport. With a mobile phone and a well-curated social media feed, it is now possible to follow great matches on five different continents, nearly every day, in real time.","As for Messi: I know few more pleasurable ways to kill a couple of hours than by squinting at a liquid-crystal screen, bugging out to the likes of “Lionel Messi Humiliating Players Two or More Times in the Same Play.” Messi is the quintessential internet-age soccer star — he scored his first goal for Barcelona in 2005, the year YouTube went online — but his persona is a throwback to an earlier period. He is a trickster and a funnyman, like an old-time silent-movie star. He’s small and scrappy, standing just 5-foot-7, the Charlie Chaplin to suave Ronaldo’s Rudolph Valentino. Many of his greatest moments play out like slapstick farce, leaving pratfalling defenders littered across the pitch.","At their best, sports like soccer are the digital age’s most reliable suppliers of an old-fashioned brand of entertainment, the special-effects-free kind, in which human beings use only their sinews and synapses to deliver thrills and spills, action and comedy. Messi’s chip in the Betis match was a comedic set piece in its own right. On YouTube, you can find video montages of the play’s aftermath: Messi and his teammates celebrating and cracking up, the goalie López mugging like an exasperated vaudeville straight man, play-by-play announcers dissolving in peals of laughter. The goal is a cosmic joke if there ever was one. A small man swings his left leg; a ball loops skyward; common sense and natural laws are suspended. You know the punch line: The ball will fall back to earth, landing — plop — in the back of the net. But no matter how many times you watch it, the gag still kills."

Bundesliga’s Chief Executive Isn’t Keen to Join Premier League - The New York Times,LONDON — The group entrusted with conducting the surprisingly difficult search for a candidate to run English soccer’s Premier League has received another rejection from an executive for whom the opportunity would appear to have been a step up.,"Earlier this year, the league approached Christian Seifert, chief executive of Germany’s Bundesliga, to see if he would like to step into the shoes of Richard Scudamore, the towering figure under whose leadership England’s top flight managed to become by far the world’s most popular soccer league, not to mention its richest.","Seifert briefly thought about the idea before dismissing it, according to people with knowledge of his thinking. He is focused on managing the next set of broadcast rights sales as Germany’s league competes with Spain’s La Liga in the battle for second place behind the Premier League, said the people, who were not authorized to speak about it publicly.",A spokeswoman for the Bundesliga and Seifert declined to comment. A Premier League spokesman said the league did not comment on names linked to the role.,"The search for Scudamore’s replacement has shined a harsh light on the search team, led by Chelsea’s chairman, Bruce Buck, entrusted to find the former advertising executive’s replacement. Last year, the group announced the appointment of Susanna Dinnage, a senior executive at Discovery Communications, before she abruptly changed her mind in late December. That left the league scrambling for a second option. A raft of names have since been linked to the post, but the search continues without any sign of an imminent appointment.","At a league board meeting, which was attended by a mix of owners and executives from the Premier League’s 20 teams, those in attendance were told that the search group, which has hired the U.K. headhunting firm Spencer Stuart to help with the process, has interviewed a final group of six candidates who will be shortlisted to three by the end of the month.","Scudamore’s replacement will find an increasingly busy inbox, as well as a challenging media climate, as the league attempts to at least keep pace with the multibillion-dollar deals that have fueled its rise. The Premier League recently joined counterparts across Europe in voicing concerns about plans by some of the continent’s top clubs to restructure the elite Champions League, changes that risk diminishing the value and relevance of domestic soccer.","The new boss must also manage tension between the league’s biggest clubs — a group of six that includes Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, who have owners from the United States and who are constantly fighting for a larger slice of income at the expense of the rest of the competition. He or she will also be faced with as yet unknown challenges created by the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.","But even without a leader, the Premier League continues to provide a compelling product for its worldwide fan base, with this season’s title race set to go to the wire as Manchester City and Liverpool match each other point for point into the final games, while the next four teams are involved in an equally tight fight for the final two qualification places for next season’s Champions League.","The delay, though, has been frustrating for some of the league’s staff and companies that do business with it. They had grown used to Scudamore’s decisive management style. For instance, the Premier League recently scrapped a multimillion-dollar agreement with Facebook to broadcast games in four Asian countries after failing to finalize the agreement. An executive involved in the talks, who had completed contracts with Scudamore in the past, said the leadership void did not help the process."
"Soccer-Suarez, Messi Late-Show Sinks Atletico After Costa Sees Red - The New York Times",BARCELONA — Barcelona closed in on the La Liga title after beating 10-man Atletico Madrid 2-0 in Saturday's top-of-the-table showdown at the Nou Camp as late strikes by Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi gave the Catalans an 11-point lead at the top of the table.,Atletico began brightly but their gameplan went out of the window when Diego Costa was shown a straight red card in the 28th minute for a verbal tirade at referee Jesus Gil Manzano.,"Atletico produced a gutsy second-half display, expertly shackling Barca, but the Catalans finally found a way past the visitors' outstanding goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a superb curling shot from Suarez in the 85th minute.","Moments later Messi sealed victory and quite probably the league title with an irresistibly cool finish into the net and Barca's fans jubilantly chanted ""champions"", crowing at their surely unassailable lead at the top with seven games remaining.",Atletico midfielder Koke conceded that Barca had wrapped up the title but questioned the decision to send Costa off.,"""Barca are practically champions.

U.A.E. Accuses Qatar of Fielding Ineligible Players at Asian Cup - The New York Times,"Two days after fans in the United Arab Emirates threw shoes at rival players during a 4-0 loss in the semifinals to Qatar at the Asian Cup, the country’s soccer federation has taken direct aim at the team itself.","Organizers of the Asian Cup said on Thursday that they would respond to an official complaint lodged by Emirates soccer officials, who charged that two members of the Qatari team were ineligible to play in the region’s biggest tournament.","The players — Almoez Ali, a Sudan-born striker, and Bassam al-Rawi, a defender born in Iraq — are fixtures in Qatar’s lineup. Ali is the tournament’s top scorer, with eight goals in six games, and al-Rawi scored the goal that sent Qatar to the quarterfinals.","The complaint is the latest salvo in a bitter dispute between the Gulf neighbors that goes far beyond soccer. The Emirates is part of a two-year-old, Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, driven by a belief that its neighbor is financing terrorism and growing too close to Iran, Saudi Arabia’s biggest regional rival; Qatar has denied playing any role in supporting terrorist groups.","The dispute has already manifested itself in ways small and large in the tournament, which now represents Qatar’s biggest success on the soccer field.","One consequence of the dispute is that there are no direct flights from Doha to Abu Dhabi, so Qatar’s team had to fly through Oman on its way to the event, and Qatari fans — unable to travel to the Emirates without permission — are largely absent at the team’s matches.","But Qatar, which has never qualified for a World Cup but will host the event in 2022, has been the surprise of the field. It will play Japan in the final on Friday.","But even as Qatar marched through the field, rumors — fueled by a close reading of FIFA nationality rules — swirled about the eligibility of Ali and al-Rawi.","The silence of Qatari officials on the issue has only led to more rumors. A spokesman for the team has not responded to repeated requests for comment, while FIFA, the global governing body for soccer, has said the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the tournament organizer, the Asian Football Confederation.",The A.F.C. had said that it would intervene only an official complaint were filed. That complaint arrived in the aftermath of the Emirates’ humiliating defeat in front of its own fans in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.,"“The Asian Football Confederation has a received a protest from the United Arab Emirates F.A. regarding the eligibility of two Qatar players,” the A.F.C. said in a statement on Thursday. “This protest will now be reviewed in line with the A.F.C. regulations.”","The A.F.C. declined to identify the possible punishment for Qatar. Teams that have previously fielded ineligible players have forfeited games, but the situation has never come up at the final stages of a major international event.","Under soccer’s regulations, players are only eligible for a national team outside of their country of birth if they have lived there for five continuous years after turning 18. Al-Rawi is 21 and Ali is 22. The rules make an exception that permits players to represent a country if a parent or grandparent was born there; many countries, including the United States, regularly take advantage of the exception.","Qatar has been trawling the world for talent for years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup, embarking on perhaps the most extensive talent identification program in history, one that involved the creation of training programs for youngsters from Africa and an academy for the best prospects in Doha.","Officials in the country have said in the past that the program does not require those scouted to pick Qatar over their birth countries. Though born in Sudan, Ali has lived in Qatar since he was a child. Al-Rawi’s father once represented Iraq internationally.","Still, Qatar’s squads at the youth and senior levels have included several expatriate players, and the eligibility was not questioned when Ali and al-Rawi represented the country at previous tournaments sanctioned by FIFA and the A.F.C.","It was not clear why the Emirates, or any of Qatar’s other opponents — including Saudi Arabia, which lost to Qatar, 2-0 — did not raise the issue until after the semifinal.","The victories over the Saudis and the Emirates were greeted by scenes of jubilation in Qatar, where fans draped in the country’s flag took to the streets of Doha to celebrate the victories.","For the hosts, the defeat was particularly painful given the efforts it had made to create a partisan atmosphere inside Abu Dhabi’s Zayed Sports City Stadium. Local organizers distributed thousands of free tickets to what it described as “loyal” fans before the game.","For the A.F.C., the issue also raises another political issue. Its president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, is being challenged for his post by candidates from the Emirates and Qatar.",The organization has opened a separate investigation over the shoe- and bottle-throwing incidents that marred the semifinal. That case could lead to sanctions.
M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber Gets Five-Year Contract Extension - The New York Times,"Don Garber, who in two decades as commissioner has overseen a wave of expansion that has more than doubled the size of Major League Soccer, has signed a five-year contract extension that will keep him in charge of the league through the 2023 season.","The league announced the new contract on Thursday. Garber’s previous deal expired after last season, but he had widely been expected to remain in his post. Garber, 61, also will continue in his role as the chairman of Soccer United Marketing, the league’s powerful — and profitable — marketing arm.","A former N.F.L. executive, Garber was recruited to join M.L.S. by the N.F.L. owners Robert Kraft and Lamar Hunt, who also owned teams in the then-fledgling soccer league.","Garber took over a 12-team M.L.S. in August 1999, and among his first moves was to close the league’s two Florida franchises, in Tampa Bay and Miami. The decision reduced the league’s roster to 10 teams and raised questions about its viability as a national league.","But in the two decades that followed, Garber led the league on a wave of expansion — first two teams in 2005, and then a steady flow of at least one new team a year from 2007 to 2012. That burst of growth included the additions of three teams in Canada, in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.","All the while, he tinkered with the league’s roster and salary rules, recruited global stars like David Beckham and persuaded the owners to invest in player development and new stadiums. M.L.S. had one soccer-specific stadium in 1999; by this summer, 20 of its teams will play in facilities they control.","Garber’s tenure has not been trouble-free. Critics point to the league’s centralized control of player contracts and Soccer United Marketing’s influence with U.S. Soccer as hampering the growth of the domestic game, and Garber once openly feuded with the former United States national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann after the coach criticized the league.","But there is little question that Garber’s tenure has transformed the league. The league now has national sponsors and television contracts that bring its games to 170 countries. Twenty-four teams will play in M.L.S. this year, including a new one in Cincinnati, and three more ownership groups have been approved to enter the league by 2021.","One of them, led by Beckham, will bring the league back to the Miami market it once abandoned."

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium Opens: Is There Room for Everyone? - The New York Times,"LONDON — Standing outside the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar, Ali Demirci pointed, proudly, to the fresh paint on the window frame. Its color was one of those on-trend grays from an upscale catalog, with a name like Elephant’s Breath or Slipper Satin. “The club came and did it,” Demirci said. He glanced upward to the other minor alteration to the shop he owned until a few weeks ago: a bright white sign. “But I installed that myself.”","On the other side of the road, the change has been rather more drastic. The window seats at the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar now offer a view of the gleaming glass frontage of the $1 billion, state-of-the-art stadium that — starting Wednesday evening, when it hosts its inaugural Premier League game — Tottenham Hotspur will call home.","The territory is, of course, familiar: The new stadium is on the same patch of land as the atmospheric, historic, old White Hart Lane, where Spurs played for 118 years. The horizon, though, is different: the club hopes the new stadium represents not just a great leap forward for Spurs — proof, in concrete and steel, that this team belongs among Europe’s pre-eminent powers — but for English soccer as a whole.","Chris Lee, its chief architect, said he had looked at some 300 stadiums around the world for inspiration and incorporated the best elements he could find into what he labeled the “best” stadium on the planet: an arena supposed to be more modern than Wembley, sleeker than Old Trafford, bigger (crucially) than Arsenal’s home at the Emirates. It is supposed to set what Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, described as a “new standard” for sports stadiums.","The arena’s centerpiece is the biggest single-tier stand in England, capable of holding 17,500 fans, modeled on Borussia Dortmund’s Südtribune — known, more commonly, as the Yellow Wall. It claims to be home to the longest bar in Europe. It has a retractable field, allowing it to host not only Premier League matches but N.F.L. games, too. It has its own microbrewery and a restaurant run by a Michelin-starred chef. And, in what is surely a first for a soccer team, Spurs will have its own on-site sommelier.","The appeal for Levy and the club, of course, is the financial boost all of that can bring: more fans, spending more time and more money, all of it flowing straight into the team’s coffers. Levy said Tuesday that, with the extra revenue generated by the stadium, Spurs’ income would be in the world’s top 10.","This is a team that has long had to wheel and deal in the transfer market. On Sunday, the club’s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted he and his staff had laughed at the sight of Naby Keita and Fabinho, £100 million worth of talent combined, on Liverpool’s bench when the teams met, representing a luxury way beyond Spurs’ means. Tottenham’s new home is, in time, supposed to change that, to turn Spurs into a club that can compete with the elite not just on the field, but off it.","The effects of the stadium, though, will resonate beyond Spurs’ balance sheet. The club has long claimed it can be a “catalyst” for the regeneration of the neighborhood around it. At a news media presentation on Tuesday, the club’s executive director, Donna Cullen, opened with a photograph of a burning car: a reminder of the riots that scarred the area — before spreading across the capital and the country — in 2011.","That hot, angry summer, Cullen said, was the “trigger” for Spurs to think about what it could do to improve not only its own horizons, but those of the place it represents. The area around Tottenham, Haringey, is the fifth-most deprived borough in London, she said: The club was taken over by a spirit of “let’s see what we can do.”","The local authority, Haringay Council, does not entirely accept the idea that Tottenham’s rebirth rests on the stadium. Charles Adje, the councilor responsible for regeneration, said he would not use the word “catalyst” himself, but he acknowledged that it “adds value to the area.”","Both the club and the council project that the new stadium could pour around £293 million a year into the local economy; Spurs estimated that it would be responsible for more than 1,700 jobs. “This stadium and this new club is going to make a massive, massive difference to the people of Tottenham,” David Lammy, Tottenham’s member of Parliament, said this week.","That, too, will take time, of course. So far, the main visible differences to Tottenham High Road are the new facades on the sandwich bar, the convenience store and a handful of other properties across from the stadium. The streets running to and from it are, otherwise, much the same as always: a jumble of jerk chicken places and nail bars, Polish supermarkets and tumbledown mechanics.","Smoking a cigarette outside the barbershop he has run for 25 years, Inan Gulecyuz said he was happy to wait. The stadium opening is, technically, bad news for him: Business drops on game days, he said, and with soccer and the N.F.L. to fit in, he will lose a little trade.","That will, he hopes, be offset by the benefits it will bring. “They have changed a lot of the shops just up the road,” he said. “Hopefully the same thing will happen down the road, too.”","A little further from the stadium, Irfan Sahin was serving coffee in Fieldseat, his delicatessen, café, bookshop and organic food market. Soft classical music played overhead.","Sahin said that he expected the stadium to alter the character of the area, to encourage more businesses to open — “There is no other Michelin-starred restaurant in north London,” he noted — but then, he said, Tottenham is changing anyway: In London, gentrification is a constant tide, regardless of where soccer clubs play.","“It is very different from when I first came here in 2001,” he said. “It is slow, of course: We had two gang fights right outside in the last year or so. But there are more places opening all of the time: bars and pubs and cafés and restaurants. It is not as expensive as central London, or as expensive as east London, so it is a good place to open. Hopefully it will be better with the stadium.”","Academic literature is unclear on whether that will hold true. Writing in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2000, John Siegfried and Andrew Zimbalist concluded — based largely on case studies in the United States — that while “team owners have argued that sports facilities boost local economic activity, economic reasoning and empirical evidence suggest the opposite.”","There are those in Tottenham, certainly, who feel disenfranchised by the speed of change and by redevelopment proposals backed by the council and the club. ","“There is a real risk of companies going out of business if we cannot find alternative locations in the neighborhood,” said Feruk Tepeyurt, the owner of a local joinery firm and chairman of the Peacock Industrial Estate, home to more than 50 small businesses but, under both the council’s plans and a separate project proposed by the club, scheduled to become a park. “Do we need a park, or do we need a community of small businesses, a lot of them run by local, black and minority ethnic people?”","That is the tension inherent in any regeneration, of course: the issue of who, precisely, it is supposed to work for, of whose needs it is meeting. “There is a thin dividing line between seeing the stadium as a catalyst for regeneration and a Trojan horse for social cleansing,” said Mark Panton, an academic at Birkbeck College who has written extensively on the dispute.","There is one change left to come: Transport for London, the capital’s transit authority, is expected to accept a proposal to rename White Hart Lane, the nearest train station to the stadium, to Tottenham Hotspur.","It is not unprecedented — Arsenal has had its own tube stop, dating to the 1930s — but nor is it universally popular. The objection is based on the idea that erasing the station’s name wipes clean a century or so of history; that it needlessly, ham-fistedly conflates the identities of Tottenham the area and Tottenham the team; that it creates the impression, deep down, below the fresh coats of paint, that the place exists to serve the club, rather than the club existing to reflect the place."
"For David Beckham and Miami, a Bumpy Road Enters the Homestretch - The New York Times","MIAMI — When David Beckham, the former captain of England’s national team, announced his intention to bring a Major League Soccer team to South Florida at a rousing event in downtown Miami five years ago, the excitement was palpable.","“I remember thinking how amazing it was going to be,” said Cesar Molero, who runs a fan club named Vice City 1896.","When Beckham returned last year for a similar event, where he and many M.L.S. executives were joined by a group of deep-pocketed local investors, there were new plans, new promises and new colors on the scarves.","By September, Beckham’s expansion team had a new name (Inter Miami) and a new logo (with twin herons). By January, its new team president had put together the core of a technical staff.","And on Wednesday, M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber confirmed what he had been saying for months: that he has the “utmost confidence” that Beckham’s group will produce a team that is a worthy successor to recent M.L.S. start-ups in Atlanta and Los Angeles.","But just over a year before Inter Miami is set to take the field for the first time, its road is not without obstacles. Battles in the courtroom and with powerful residents of South Florida have blocked its progress more than once. The team is working on its fifth potential stadium site, with no assurances that this one will be the last, and is facing multiple lawsuits seeking to block the club’s right to acquire the property.",Even the most passionate followers of the team — who are united more around an idea than anything tangible — have been pulled in different directions. The cause of their split is the most basic of disputes: They disagreed over what their group should be called.,"The original fan group — known as the Southern Legion — was also the largest, with more than 400 dues-paying members. But last year it sought to rename itself The Siege.","“We felt a change was appropriate once we saw the crest,” said Max Ramos, a founding member of the Southern Legion. “A group of herons is called a siege. It felt right.”","Those who felt otherwise split off and kept the original name. Ramos insisted there were no hard feelings. The amicable split, he said, is a sign of the camaraderie that has helped fans remain steadfast in their dedication to Beckham’s grand, but at times excruciatingly fluid, plan.","There is no turning back at this point, anyway. Last year, Beckham and his new group of well-financed, well-connected investors were finally granted the rights to an expansion place in the league. Satisfied that doubts about a stadium plan and the Beckham group’s resources and local commitment had been resolved, the commissioner confirmed that the team would enter M.L.S. in the 2020 season.","The matter of where it will make that debut, however, is a bit more complicated.","Inter Miami has been the focus of a stream of legal action in recent months, with issues including an ethics complaint related to the owners’ political lobbying, disputes about the feasibility of building a stadium on its preferred site and the legality of public votes on the matter.","Thwarted at several downtown locations, the team now has its sights on creating Miami Freedom Park, a $1 billion complex spread over 160 acres at Melreese Country Club, a city-owned golf course near Miami International Airport. Critics have ridiculed the proposal as a real estate deal with a 25,000-seat soccer stadium included, but a larger problem may lurk underneath the golf course: Last July, it was revealed that it sits atop a toxic waste dump.","“There are so many holes in their plans — it’s unreal,” said David Winker, a Florida-based lawyer who has filed two lawsuits against Beckham’s franchise in the past five months.","Winker described himself as a soccer fan eager to take his family to matches when the team begins play — Florida International University could serve as a temporary home while the legal fights continue — but not, he said, at any cost.","“I was immediately suspicious of how the deal was being conducted — behind closed-door negotiations and in a frantic rush,” Winker added, calling it “just a terrible way to introduce a new sports team to Miami.”","Still, in November, it appeared that Beckham, his ownership group and M.L.S. had finally cleared the last hurdle. Amid songs, drumbeats and free paella on Election Day, Beckham and his new partners — including Jose and Jorge Mas, the Miami-based construction magnates; Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese owner of SoftBank; Marcelo Claure, the former chief executive of Sprint telecommunications; and the pop-music mogul Simon Fuller — celebrated victory in a public referendum that had granted them the right to enter into a noncompete bidding process for the Melreese property.","Just 24 hours later, however, those negotiations were frozen because of an ethics complaint filed by Winker after he noticed that of all the people who spoke on behalf of the project before the city commission that will decide its fate, none had properly registered as a lobbyist. Those speakers included the aunt of the commission’s chairman, Keon Hardemon.","Although the Miami-Dade County ethics commission issued a letter last month advising that the negotiations over a 99-year lease on the golf course site could move forward while an investigation continued, problems persist.","Winker filed a lawsuit in which he argued that city documents provided an unclear land description, and that the city should be prohibited from using the referendum as authorization to negotiate a no-bid lease. Ordinarily, he said, that type of sale would be open to bids.","A separate lawsuit by Bruce C. Matheson, a wealthy landowner in South Florida, also took aim at the referendum. Matheson had previously filed suit to block a stadium planned for the Overtown neighborhood of Miami, near where he owns property.","“Each plan seems more convoluted than the last,” Matheson said this month.","Victoria Mendez, the city’s lawyer, told The Miami Herald last month that the actions filed by Winker and Matheson did not “depict a clear understanding of our codes.” M.L.S. continues to express its support; in November, Garber hailed the victory in the stadium referendum as “a historic day for the sport in our country.”","Inter Miami, meanwhile, is plowing ahead.","“The baseless and frivolous lawsuits/complaints will not deter any of our efforts and focus,” Jorge Mas wrote in an email. “These are sideshows and a nonissue to our plan.”","Beckham, who is based in London, has placed confidence in his local partners to navigate the political and legal waters of South Florida.",The team’s fans appear to be doing the same.,"“Once we begin playing next year,” said Ramos, the Siege leader, “everything else will be forgotten.”"
"In Europe, a Bitter Battle Between Clubs and Leagues Is Taking Shape - The New York Times","LONDON — Confronted with what they consider a power play by a group of wealthy soccer clubs to promote the Champions League at the expense of national championships, representatives of Europe’s domestic leagues will meet in Lisbon this week to discuss a strategy to protect what they say is decades of tradition, and a basic sense of fairness.","What the leagues fear, several officials said, is what they consider a behind-the-scenes campaign to reshape European soccer for the exclusive benefit of the continent’s biggest clubs. The leagues contend the proposed changes to the Champions League, which include new barriers to entry for nonelite clubs and schedule changes that would push matches onto weekend dates, will diminish the relevance and marketability of domestic leagues, and potentially render many of their matches irrelevant.","At this week’s Lisbon meeting, an annual gathering of the umbrella European Leagues group, members will discuss plans to fight back — perhaps even in court — against suggested changes that they argue will adversely affect the competitions that still form the cultural and financial backbone of the global soccer industry. The coalition of leagues is a diverse group — leagues from Portugal to Ukraine are members — but a potentially formidable one given the influence and resources of members like England’s Premier League, Germany’s Bundesliga and Spain’s La Liga.","“The association of European Leagues is raising its voice and the leagues are cohesive more than ever in the defense and protection of domestic football,” said Alberto Colombo, the deputy general secretary of the European league body, in an interview.","While representatives of the continent’s richest and most powerful clubs and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, say any discussions for reforming club competitions like the Champions League remain in their infancy, league officials have grown increasingly concerned about details of the proposed changes that have started to leak.","The most dramatic include reducing the size of national leagues and altering their schedules to allow European games to be played on weekends, a window historically reserved for domestic matches. The Bundesliga’s chief executive called weekend Champions League matches a “red line” that could not be crossed. English officials similarly declared the idea a nonstarter.","“It is the role of the Premier League and other English football organizations to govern the format of league and cup competitions in this country,” the Premier League spokesman Nick Noble said. “It would be wholly inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structure of domestic English football.”","Other proposals would see access to the Champions League itself severely restricted, with only 8 of 32 participants allowed to earn their places through success in domestic competition the previous season. The other 24 places would be reserved for teams already in the Champions League, or a handful of participants from a second-tier European club competition.","Andrea Agnelli, the president of Juventus, who leads the powerful European Club Association, said at that group’s annual meeting in Amsterdam last week that it would be at least a year before any changes would be finalized, and he refused to discuss details of proposals already under discussion. However, in an interview with The Guardian last year, he described reforms he would like to see that appear to be similar to those currently under discussion.","While the E.C.A. represents more than 200 clubs from across Europe, it is increasingly dominated by a handful of the largest teams. That group includes the likes of Juventus and Bayern Munich but also heavyweights from Spain and England like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Those clubs have for years used their might — and threats to break away and form an exclusive competition outside the current domestic league structure — to wrest concessions from soccer’s leaders.","Javier Tebas, the frequently outspoken head of Spain’s top league, said the proposal to restructure continental competitions for the benefit of the small group of rich clubs that already dominate them would spell doom for soccer in large parts of Europe. The changes would, Tebas said, allow the wealthiest clubs to widen the massive talent and resource gap they already enjoy, and tear away the fabric of the sport’s traditions.","Playing European competition matches on the weekend, in particular, would be “a recipe for the demise of football across Europe,” Tebas said in a statement. The Bundesliga’s chief executive, Christian Seifert, concurred in a speech earlier this year.","“The weekend must belong to the national leagues,” Seifert said. “They are the heart and soul of professional football.”","Access to the Champions League is currently linked to performance in domestic leagues, but under one set of proposals that could change drastically, with most participating teams allowed to compete year after year regardless of their league positions. In one plan, Europe’s top 32 teams would be divided into four groups of eight teams, with the top four each season advancing to a knockout round to determine the winner.","Such a change would dramatically reduce the attractiveness of national leagues for broadcasters, where the battle to qualify for European club competitions has long been part of the narrative sold to television companies. At times, in fact, the battle for Champions League positions has often been more compelling than the race for the title, which in some countries is often wrapped up months before the end of the campaign.","Agnelli hinted that, in the future, qualification could be based on success within European competitions — a setup that would maximize places for teams already in, and serve as a significant barrier to clubs trying to break in.","“It is certainly something that is logical,” he said when asked if teams could be promoted or relegated within a closed European system. The proposals could transform soccer’s top club competition into one that resembles a similar event in European basketball, where 11 of the 16 teams in the EuroLeague are guaranteed spots regardless of their domestic performances.","For the biggest clubs, a closed-off Champions League would offer financial certainty. But the leagues are vowing to defend a structure that currently allows any team the opportunity to win — on the field — a place among the giants.","“The leagues defend the basic values of the European sport model, based on sporting merits, an open-access pyramid structure where all clubs form the foundation and all clubs could live the dream to reach the top,” said Colombo, of the European league body.","While the top clubs have forged close links to UEFA thanks to a deepening friendship between Agnelli, the E.C.A. leader, and UEFA’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, the leagues — faced with a critical leadership void at a vital moment — have struggled to present a cohesive opposing voice. The Premier League, for example, remains without a leader after stumbling in its search for a replacement for its longtime chief executive Richard Scudamore, who retired last year. And Lars-Christer Olsson, the chairman of the European League body, has only recently recovered from a serious illness."
"FIFA Leaders Head to U.S., a Trip Once Fraught With Risk - The New York Times",Not so long ago the idea of merely setting foot in the United States would have filled FIFA’s leaders with dread. The idea of holding an important meeting there would have been rejected as absurd.,"That was because a sprawling corruption indictment by the United States Department of Justice in 2015 had threatened the very existence of FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. The investigation had produced the dawn arrests of more than a dozen top power brokers in the sport and eventually led to the ouster of some of the organization’s most powerful figures. It left others fearful of traveling to the United States for any reason, lest they risk being picked up by the authorities.","Yet this week, almost four years later, FIFA is bringing the members of its governing council — a body that, in an earlier incarnation, was accused by the American authorities of engaging in graft schemes dating back decades — to United States soil for the first time since the scandal broke. The 37-member body, an expanded group now known as the FIFA Council, will hold a meeting in Miami on Friday to discuss, among other things, a significant expansion of the 2022 World Cup and a multibillion-dollar plan for a new World Cup-style competition for clubs.","The site of the meeting, FIFA says, is the latest sign that it has moved on from its corrupt past.","“It’s probably fair to say that there is a symbolic significance for the FIFA Council to meet in the U.S.A. for the first time since 2015,” FIFA, which is based in Zurich, said in a statement.","Four years ago, images of police officers leading soccer officials out of a luxury Swiss hotel in two separate dawn raids gripped the sporting world, unleashing a crisis that has cost FIFA millions of dollars and led to years of turmoil. Dozens of soccer officials, businessmen and companies have since pleaded guilty to charges in United States courts; others are fighting extradition; and two men, including the former head of South American soccer, were jailed after a 2017 trial in New York. The crisis also led to the ouster of a number of executives not named in the indictments, including FIFA’s longtime president at the time, Joseph S. Blatter.","While there is little sign another blockbuster raid is in the offing, United States authorities’ interest in FIFA has not dimmed. Multiple defendants who have pleaded guilty in the case have not yet been sentenced, with prosecutors again agreeing this year to push back decisions about the punishments of at least five people, including an Argentine businessman who testified at the New York trial and has served as a key cooperating witness.","“FIFA remains ready to assist public authorities in all cases and, while the experience was difficult, we are finally very grateful that the U.S. Department of Justice intervened when it did to address some serious governance problems and, in so doing, help put FIFA on the path to reform,” its statement added.","The current leadership has attempted to build bridges with the American authorities. FIFA’s top legal official, the deputy secretary general Alasdair Bell, made it a priority to visit Brooklyn and meet with prosecutors upon joining the soccer body in September. His visit came a month after FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, met with President Trump at the White House.","Such trips were considered perilous four years ago. Blatter and his former No. 2, Jérôme Valcke, who faces a separate corruption investigation in Switzerland, skipped the Women’s World Cup when it was held in Canada in the summer of 2015, only weeks after the first raids in Switzerland. Other officials also have stayed safely out of reach.","FIFA has not confirmed whether any council members will skip next week’s meeting, though at least one may not travel, according to a person familiar with the council member’s thinking.","Coming to Miami also renews focus on Concacaf, the regional confederation that governs soccer in North and Central America and Caribbean. Based in the city, Concacaf is one of soccer’s six regional governing bodies, but it perhaps felt the most damage from the scandal: three of its former presidents were charged by United States authorities, and an internal probe later found multiple examples of rogue behavior, including self-dealing, indiscriminate use of private jets and even the recruitment of a private detective to snoop on individuals, including the former U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati, who still sits on the FIFA Council.","Concacaf, which  nearly closed amid a banking crisis brought on by the Justice Department case, is largely prospering after introducing governance reforms. It has also changed headquarters, moving from a location in Miami Beach that was the target of F.B.I. raids in 2015 to a new office in the city’s business district.","Its current president, Victor Montagliani of Canada, said Concacaf had “long turned the page” on its existential crisis.","“Having FIFA come to Miami for the first time since the events of 2015 marks a momentum forward for world football,” he said, “and we are glad to play our part.”","While its worst days may have passed, global soccer continues to be dogged by sporadic episodes of unethical behavior by senior figures. A Ghanaian member of the FIFA Council, Kwesi Nyantakyi, received a lifetime ban last year after being caught on camera accepting thousands of dollars in cash from an undercover reporter. And last week, another council member, Lee Harmon of the Cook Islands, received a three-month ban for the illegal resale of tickets to last year’s World Cup in Russia.","To Miguel Maduro, a former governance head at FIFA, the continuing problems are both structural and cultural, part of a system that he said was still being run as a “political cartel.” Infantino, for example, will stand unopposed for re-election later this year in an election that will mirror the one for the presidency of European soccer in February. In that race, the incumbent, Aleksander Ceferin, was re-elected by acclamation.","Perhaps the biggest sign of FIFA’s difficulties in changing the culture is its inability to wean the council members who will be in Miami off the kind of lifestyle even they have acknowledged to be excessive. At previous meetings, for example, members have described being met on the airport tarmac and whisked to luxury hotels without having to go through the usual arrival protocol. Even after FIFA’s reforms, they receive annual salaries of $250,000, plus an additional per diem, to attend as few as three meetings a year.","“That’s one of the reasons you maintain the cartel,” Maduro said. “You have to satisfy the people that keep you in power.”"
German Clubs and English Teenagers: The Jadon Sancho Effect - The New York Times,"DORTMUND, Germany — At first glance, it is easy to pinpoint the start of the Bundesliga’s love affair with young English players. The opening scene of a story that has swept a host of England’s brightest prospects out of the Premier League’s overstuffed academies and into top-flight German soccer is set at a specific time — the first few days of October 2016 — and in a specific place: Pula, Croatia.","That week, England’s under-17 team took part in the Croatian Cup, a youth invitational that also featured teams from Germany, Greece and the host nation. England won it, and in some style, rounding off the competition with an 8-1 rout of Germany.","Even before that, though, the amount of talent on display had turned heads. Several scouts from Bundesliga clubs had been in attendance at Pula’s Aldo Drosina Stadium for England’s first game, a 5-0 win against Croatia.","Though many of the English players involved would go on to win the under-17 World Cup a little more than a year later, one, in particular, stood out. A scout, present that day, remembers being taken aback by the player’s appetite. Even with England comfortably ahead, he said, he kept running, kept trying to score goals.","The scout flagged the player, Jadon Sancho, to his superiors, but to no avail. Less than a year later, Sancho was on his way to Germany, but to sign with Borussia Dortmund, another of the clubs that had watched him that day. Within a few months, he was a regular on Dortmund’s first team, a senior England international and one of the most coveted players in Europe.","He was also a trendsetter. After Sancho, a flood of young British players have landed in the Bundesliga: Arsenal’s Emile Smith Rowe — another veteran of that Croatian trip — and Reiss Nelson, on loan at RB Leipzig and TSG Hoffenheim; representatives at Augsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach and Schalke.","In January, Bayern Munich was so determined to sign Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi — another who featured in Croatia — that it offered 40 million euros (about $45 million) for a teenager who had made only a handful of senior appearances. Sancho’s effect, the legacy of that day in Pula, has been powerful.","It is a compelling story, but not necessarily an accurate one. Sancho has been presented as the trigger for German clubs’ fascination with young English talent, but, in reality, he was the end result: a consequence, rather than a cause, of a trend that dates way beyond 2016, one that explains why, exactly, all of those Bundesliga scouts were watching that under-17 game in Pula.","“About 10 years ago, we decided that young players had to be our focus as a club,” said Max Eberl, Mönchengladbach’s sporting director. “We had no financial potential to do anything else. We had to create money and value a different way.”","That meant keeping tabs on the best young talent not just in Germany, but across Europe. Mönchengladbach’s scouts started watching national youth teams, a shortcut to establishing which players were regarded as the best in their homelands, and a chance to compare them directly with the talent on the rise in Germany.","The initial emphasis, Eberl explained, was on France, Belgium and Holland — traditionally fertile breeding grounds — as well as markets like Denmark, where his club had strong links. England “was not a market we had focused on,” he said, but it did not take long to realize that there were a “lot of top players” in England’s age-group teams.","Eberl dispatched scouts not to watch the Premier League, but to games between clubs’ under-18 and under-23 teams. “At the time, English clubs bought players but did not care about their academies,” he said. “The players they were developing — 30 or 40 guys, really good, really well prepared — had no chance.”","Around the same time, Dortmund came to the same realization. “Five or 10 years ago, we had the feeling that the education and development of youth players in England is quite good,” Michael Zorc, the club’s technical director, said. “The teams don’t only spend money on transfers and salaries, but on infrastructure. When you see these academies, you cannot compare the standard with Germany. It is much, much higher.”","Most important, these state-of-the-art facilities were churning out players with the skill sets Bundesliga clubs needed. “England had so many creative players,” Nils Schmadtke, formerly the head scout at Cologne, said. “Kids like Sancho: good at penetrating the sidelines, not afraid in one against ones, good technique, fast.”","Just as significant as discovering this steady supply of talent in England, though, was the increasing demand in Germany.","Youth is the Bundesliga’s calling card. Germany’s top division prides itself on its clubs’ willingness to give players an opportunity — a report compiled in February found that it is the youngest of Europe’s major leagues — regardless of age or experience. It sees and sells itself, according to one recent mailing, as a “talent factory.”","Increasingly, though, there are concerns that less and less of that talent is emerging locally, at a time when German soccer — both at the international level and within the Bundesliga — is in need of renewal.","The generation that won the 2014 World Cup failed miserably in Russia last summer, a disappointment compounded by relegation from its group in the inaugural Nations League last year. Joachim Löw, the national team coach, has vowed to transform the side, informing several stalwarts — Mats Hummels, Thomas Müller and Jérôme Boateng — that they will no longer be considered for selection.","For the first time in more than a decade, the Bundesliga will not be represented in the Champions League quarterfinals. Bayern Munich is already planning for a substantial overhaul of its squad at the end of the season.","It is telling that Hudson-Odoi, a young English winger, is at the forefront of its thinking: Zorc admitted last month that at the under-17 and under-19 levels, England had “overtaken” Germany. Schmadtke said that he believed the “individual skills” he saw from young English players — as well as on scouting trips to France — stood out because they are now so rare in his homeland. For Bayern, as for the national team, the pipeline of German talent has dried up.","Eberl, for one, believes that Germany has “made mistakes” in developing its young players. Clubs, he said, have fallen into the trap of trying to produce winning youth teams, rather than concentrating on individuals. Schmadtke feels German teenagers suffer because they are exposed too quickly to senior soccer, playing for so-called B teams in regional leagues, rather than in youth-specific competitions, as they do in England.","Both are confident that it is a hiatus, rather than a full stop. “We will have players in the future, but it will take time,” Eberl said. In the meantime, German clubs will continue to flock to England, hoping to find yet more players to follow the path Sancho has plotted. It is a result not of a love affair, but of the simple economics of supply and demand."
"Deep Roots at Everton, and New Ones, Too - The New York Times","LIVERPOOL, England — Friday morning, and Goodison Park is quiet. There are no fans milling around the streets outside, spilling out of the Winslow pub, eagerly rushing to their seats. There is no noise, no color, no riot of blue and white. There are only a handful of cars in the parking lot. It is spitting with rain.","A stadium is a home, but that is, in truth, only an occasional role. These are places that blossom only every other weekend, as Goodison will on Sunday when Liverpool arrives for the latest Merseyside Derby. For much of the rest of the time, though, a stadium is dormant, quiet: an empty, expectant shell.","The day-to-day life of a club — the parts of it that are dedicated to the business of soccer, and the parts of it dedicated to the soccer business — happens elsewhere. For Everton, the former is at Finch Farm, its training facility on the eastern fringes of Liverpool. The latter is in the Liver Buildings, on the city’s sparkling waterfront, where Everton relocated its offices last year, a new home for all those departments whose job it is to sell shirts and tickets and sponsorship deals. To most fans, a club is a team, hopefully to win games. To all owners, a club is a business, hopefully to make money.","A club is more than that, though; there is another side, one which does its work not on the field at Goodison Park or in the suite of offices in the city, but in the tight warren of terraced streets that surround the stadium, in schools across Liverpool, in some of the most underprivileged parts of Merseyside.","Across the street from Goodison Park, a group of children are playing on the Cruyff Court — a small, artificial soccer field surrounded by a metal cage, built in conjunction with the Johan Cruyff Foundation — behind Everton’s community hub. Inside, teenagers mill and mingle with teachers and coaches in Everton polo shirts.","Around the corner, in what was once a run-down working men’s club, a few dozen retirees are spending the morning cycling through their memories — of Everton, of the city — over tea and cake. Pat van den Hauwe, a tough-tackling defender who played for the team in the 1980s, is helping serve the coffee.","On Goodison Road, the club has bought three houses and converted them into drop-in centers, safe spaces for anyone who feels they need a place to go. Their doors are always open. There is always someone to talk to. There is always food in the fridge.","All clubs run outreach programs, of course, and employ staff members to work in the communities they call home. But few, if any, can match Everton’s for size and scope. The buildings that house Everton in the Community cost more than $10 million to develop; the program’s annual budget is around $4 million. It has 125 staff members and 145 volunteers. It works in more than 200 locations: schools, youth clubs, community centers.","There is barely a part of life in Liverpool — and particularly in the L4 postal code that is home to both Goodison Park and Anfield, Liverpool’s stadium, and among the most deprived areas in Britain — that the club does not touch.","It oversees more than 40 social programs, focused on issues as diffuse as mental health and serious organized crime; it reaches more than 20,000 people a year. Last year, Everton won a grant of 700,000 pounds, or about $925,000, to lead a government scheme on Merseyside to tackle gang culture. It has a presence in 150 schools. In September 2015, it became the first club to launch its own school.","Everton has, for more than a decade, styled itself as Liverpool’s People’s Club, a term popularized by David Moyes, its former manager, to distinguish it from its near neighbor. Banners bearing the phrase flutter from Goodison Park; scarves embossed with the slogan can be bought from stands around the stadium on match day.","“Our fans hold us up against that image,” Everton’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said. “They expect us to live up to it. It is not a corporate social responsibility program. It is long-term, strategic work. It is a huge component of what Everton is.” So substantial, in fact, that before she was promoted to running Everton last year, Barrett-Baxendale ran not the commercial section of the club, or its merchandising arm, but its community department.","It is not just the scale of Everton’s work that marks it as different, though; it is the scope of it, too. Everton goes into areas other clubs — and other charities, even — might find “intimidating,” as Barrett-Baxendale put it. Sue Gregory, Everton in the Community’s director of youth engagement, recalls representatives of other teams marveling at the fact that Everton — in theory, just a soccer club — was prepared to work with convicted criminals, drug dealers, members of gangs. “You could see it as the club risking its brand,” she said.","Barrett-Baxendale does not. “We work on these issues because these issues exist on the streets of Merseyside,” she said. It is a view supported throughout the club. At the start of the season, Everton’s players signed a pledge that they would do their part to help with community work. A copy of it hangs on a wall in the Community’s hub. There have been times that players have had to be reminded to leave after sessions there: Tom Davies, the midfielder, once insisted he was happy to stay for as long as possible at one session because he was busy “coloring in unicorns.”","Gregory, her staff and her volunteers know how much all of that matters. They hear all of the stories: the teenagers forced to work selling drugs for gangs to settle their parents’ debts, or chased through the streets for punishment beatings; the boys sent hundreds of miles from home as part of the “county lines” phenomenon, in which city gangs seek to control the drug market in smaller towns; the children who stock up on food at the sessions because there is not enough to eat at home.","Everton does not have a choice, in other words, but to confront those problems. Shying away from them would make all the work it does nothing but tokenism. “This is our community,” Gregory said, adding: “These are the issues our community faces. There is a culture of ‘let’s try.’”","Wherever it can, it makes the most of the power of its crest: The white-on-blue depiction of Prince Rupert’s Tower, instantly recognizable, is part of the city’s civic scenery. It transcends tribal loyalty — many Liverpool fans are part of the Everton programs — and represents, instead, permanence.","“People trust the badge,” said Richard Kenyon, Everton in the Community’s chief executive. “They respond to it in a really powerful way. They’re drawn to it.”","Those who would normally eschew authority figures, those who would not respond to local government or a school principal, respond to that crest. Everton, they know, is not going anywhere.","“We are a consistent presence,” Gregory said. “Kids might have a really good connection with a teacher in one year, but then they move on, and the kids lose that. We are always there, so that bond is not lost.”","This, more than the team or the business, is what a club is, what a club can do. Not far from Goodison Park is one of Everton in the Community’s smallest projects: a little corner of scrap land that has been converted into an herb garden. The plot is little more than a postage stamp. When Everton started it, encouraging children from these streets to tend to it, some worried that it would be ruined, vandalized, maybe even in its first few days. That was months ago. It is still pristine."
"Atlanta United’s Darren Eales on Buying High, Selling Higher and Staying on Top - The New York Times",ATLANTA — Most teams that win championships enjoy a honeymoon. There are parades and victory laps and time to prepare for a title defense.,"Not so with Atlanta United, which won its first M.L.S. Cup on Dec. 8 and, because of Major League Soccer roster rules, had to spend the next day releasing some of the players who led it to the title. In fact, from almost the moment the final whistle blew in Atlanta United’s 2-0 victory over the Portland Timbers, the club president, Darren Eales, has had to grapple with a host of changes, including finding a new coach, selling one of his team’s best players and juggling the remaking of a star-studded roster.","At times, the off-season has seemed comically short. Atlanta United reconvened as a team and opened its preseason training camp in mid-January, then flew to California before the Super Bowl to prepare for a preseason friendly against Club Tijuana. Last week, Atlanta United lost to Costa Rica’s Herediano, 3-1, in the first stage of the Concacaf Champions League (the teams meet again in Atlanta on Thursday night), and on Sunday it opens its M.L.S. season against D.C. United in Washington.","All of this meant Eales had to get his off-season work done quickly, and he has not wasted any time. On Jan. 14, Atlanta United introduced Frank de Boer, the former manager of Ajax, Inter Milan and Crystal Palace, as the replacement for Atlanta’s former coach, Tata Martino, who took over Mexico’s national team. Then Eales signed Josef Martínez, the league’s most valuable player last season, to a five-year contract extension. Soon after, Pity Martínez, a 25-year-old Argentine midfielder, was signed; that move allowed Eales to sell Atlanta’s playmaker, Miguel Almirón, to England’s Newcastle United for a reported $23 million, smashing the M.L.S. transfer record.","Two days before the Super Bowl, the hyperkinetic Eales sat down at his favorite Atlanta coffee shop — appropriately named Octane — to discuss the team’s dizzying off-season, its sale of Almirón and whether, in fact, other teams in M.L.S. can copy the Atlanta model.",You knew you were going to have a lot of holes to fill in the off-season. What was the process?,"When we went out and built the club, our intention was to be clear with the fans from the very start. We were going to attract players who were young, or going toward the prime of their career, rather than a last contract or a last hurrah for a player from Europe. The idea here is, we’re part of this global network of soccer clubs. Miggy came to us, he had two fantastic years, won the M.L.S. Cup in the second season, had tremendous success on the pitch, and then he got a chance to fulfill his dream to go to the Premier League and play for a club there. So obviously, it was good for him, good for the league, because now the league can say, ‘We have a mechanism for you to showcase yourself, so come to M.L.S., play in a short window, and when the right moment comes, you can move to a top league in Europe.’ That was the dream we sold, and we had to at least prove the concept because otherwise it was going to be difficult for us to recruit other players if we didn’t do that.","This business model is routine elsewhere, but it’s still new to M.L.S. Wasn’t it hard to see Almirón go?","Miggy delivered everything we could have expected, and we won an M.L.S. Cup. On top of that, we didn’t spend dead money on a player at the end of his contract and get nothing in return. We actually got well in excess of what we had spent on the player in the first place. So it makes good business sense, good sporting sense, and that was always the vision.","You signed Josef Martínez to a contract extension, then acquired Pity Martínez, before you sold Almirón. Was that sequencing deliberate?","We’re really pleased that we did the whole succession plan in reverse. We got our player in [Martínez] before we moved the player on to Europe [Almirón]. Hypothetically, if we first sold a player for $30 million and went out to buy a player, everyone’s going to quote us $30 million. It’s the nature of the beast. So to secure our replacement in advance with a number we were comfortable with, it gave us a little more carte blanche.","You also had to replace Tata Martino, whose reputation was instrumental in attracting young players to Atlanta for the first year.","When we sat there after winning the Cup, we knew the coach was going. The reality is, it’s no different than Nick Saban, who has said how he loses his coordinators every year but he doesn’t mind because he knows the replacements come in and work hard because they have a chance to move on. We can embrace that as a club. When coaches want to come to Atlanta, they can see that as well. Frank de Boer coached at Ajax, at Inter and Crystal Palace. For me, I’m really excited because certain coaches fit players. With Ajax, he had great success. He went into situations [at Inter and Crystal Palace] that weren’t good fits. But he was the right fit for us.","A lot has had to go right: Not just the success on the field, but an owner with deep pockets, a new stadium, enthusiastic fans. You have all of that.","Everyone’s been asking when soccer is going to succeed in America, but if you watched the Cup final, with 73,000 passionate fans who were tailgating all afternoon, with an exciting style of play, it really has happened in America already. It’s great for me because yes, I wanted to make Atlanta United a real success story. But we’re also part of the bigger story, which is growing the game of soccer in America, being the pioneers to hopefully one day make it one of the top leagues in the world.",Can other M.L.S. teams replicate what you’ve done?,"I’m not sure about replicating, but like every other business, you look at what other businesses are doing successfully and try to take those things that might work. I’m a fan of how L.A.F.C. came into the league. You saw the way they filled out their roster; there were similarities. I wouldn’t say they were copying us, but there were similarities. That’s a good thing. We were in a strange situation as pioneers trying to grow the league. There will be more teams looking, when they think of their out-of-pocket expenditures, money above the cap, not just the salaries — there’s much more awareness around investing more than we would have in a transfer fee for a younger player because we might have a chance to make a profit, or make our investment back. That’s going to open up an avenue for a few more clubs.","With all this activity, did you get a chance to take any time off this winter?","My aim is to get to March, the international break. I promised the wife and family I’ll take a week off, and football won’t be mentioned. I’m hoping to get to the end of March and then I’ll crash."
A Juventus Striker Faced Racist Abuse. His Teammate and His Coach Said He Provoked It. - The New York Times,"Only hours after the president of European soccer’s governing body urged referees on Tuesday to call a halt to games marred by racial abuse, the Juventus striker Moise Kean, who is black, was subjected to racist abuse by fans. He was then criticized by one of his own teammates, as well as his manager, who blamed him for provoking the taunts.","The insults directed at Kean — and the reproach from his teammate and his coach — came only hours after Aleksander Ceferin, the president of UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, had told an equality conference in London that his organization would speak with referees and encourage them “not to be afraid to act” if they heard racist abuse from the crowd.","Hours later, in a match in Italy’s Serie A at Cagliari, Kean, a 19-year-old Italian forward of Ivorian descent, and two other black teammates, the French midfielder Blaise Matuidi and the Brazilian defender Alex Sandro, were subjected to consistent racial abuse from Cagliari fans during Juventus’s 2-0 victory.","When Kean, who is enjoying a breakout season with Juventus, scored his team’s second goal to seal the victory, he stood motionless, holding his arms out, in front of the Cagliari fans, prompting yet more abuse. Matuidi, his teammate, was incensed; the Juventus captain, Giorgio Chiellini, protested to the referee, Piero Giacomelli; and Cagliari’s captain, Luca Ceppitelli, asked his team’s fans to stop.","After the game, however, the Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci suggested that Kean should shoulder an equal share of the blame because his celebration had antagonized those in Cagliari’s Curva — the end of the stadium where the team’s most ardent fans are housed — who were racially abusing him.","“Kean knows that when he scores a goal, he has to focus on celebrating with his teammates,” Bonucci said. “He knows he could have done something differently.","“There were racist jeers after the goal. Blaise heard it and was angry. I think the blame is 50-50. Moise should not have done that, and the Curva should not have reacted that way.”","Though Massimiliano Allegri, Juventus’s coach, told reporters that nothing justified the behavior of the fans — describing those who had racially abused his players as “idiots” — he, too, suggested that Kean had “provoked” some of the vitriol.","“He should not have celebrated in that manner,” said Allegri, a former Cagliari manager. “He is a young man and has to learn, but certain things from the crowd also should not be heard. You need great intelligence to deal with these situations and should not provoke people.","“That, of course, does not mean the idiots in the crowd and the way they reacted should be justified.”","Allegri insisted that he does not believe halting games is the solution to ending racist abuse, though, because, he said, “not everyone in the stadium” should be punished for the actions of a few.","“I don’t think talking about it all the time helps,” he said.","Kean posted his own response on his Instragam account: a photo of his silent, arms-out goal celebration and the words, “The best way to respond to racism.”","The president of Cagliari, Tommaso Giulini, said Juventus players had told him that Kean was wrong to celebrate in front of the home fans, and he bemoaned all of the “moralizing” over the incident — claiming that there had been no racist abuse until Kean had provoked the fans.","“Cagliari rejects the accusations of racism,” he said. “Nothing had happened until the goal. Do not exploit the thing.”","A welter of high-profile players moved immediately to support Kean: Raheem Sterling, himself a victim of racist abuse this season, told Bonucci on Instagram that his comments were laughable; Paul Pogba, a former Juventus player, encouraged “good Italians” to “wake up, you can’t let a small racist group speak for you.”","The abuse aimed at Kean was only the most recent in a litany of racist incidents in Italian soccer: In December, the Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was abused during a game against Inter Milan; last year, the striker Michy Batshuayi, then playing for Borussia Dortmund, claimed that he was racially abused during a game at Atalanta, in Bergamo. Matuidi has previously been abused at Cagliari and at Verona.","Football Against Racism in Europe, an activist group, has described the problem in Italy as an “epidemic,” linking it to a rise in far-right politics and anti-immigration policies."
"FIFA Approves Plan for New Club World Cup, to Europe’s Dismay - The New York Times","MIAMI — Against the wishes of European soccer leaders, FIFA pushed through plans for a revamped World Cup of clubs featuring 24 teams at a meeting of its governing council on Friday. The decision ended a debate that had lasted a year, while at the same time raised doubts about the caliber of participants in a major new competition championed by FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino.","The remaking of the competition from winter afterthought to potential summer moneymaker — a replacement for the Confederations Cup, an unpopular national-team competition usually held a year before the World Cup — has led to a major breakdown in relations between FIFA and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA. All the European members at the FIFA meeting voted against the plan for the new tournament on Friday.","European club teams, whose participation will be critical to the success of the reimagined Club World Cup, reiterated their opposition to the event only minutes after FIFA made its announcement that it had been approved. The European Club Association, an umbrella body for the continent’s top teams, said its members would not participate in the event, even though FIFA’s plan includes slots for eight European teams.","Infantino, though, described himself as “a happy president,” saying he was confident that after further talks, opposition to the event would subside and the world’s top teams would take part. He pointed out that the event — held every four years — could bring in billions of extra dollars to FIFA’s coffers, which currently benefit from more than $6 billion from each World Cup.","“We hope all the greatest teams will participate,” Infantino said at a news conference. “The best teams should have this world platform.”","The main opposition to the plans largely relates to adding more events to soccer’s already busy global calendar, with fears that even more games could burn out top players, or leave them susceptible to injuries. UEFA said any changes should wait until 2024, when a new comprehensive schedule for global soccer is set to be approved.","The Club World Cup plan had led to an almost complete breakdown in the relationship between Infantino and Aleksander Ceferin, the UEFA president. The men had not held talks for a year since a meeting last year in Colombia during which Infantino first unveiled the proposal. They did, however, meet for an hour on Thursday morning, where Ceferin outlined UEFA’s continued opposition.","In other news Friday, the FIFA Council agreed to push ahead with plans to expand the World Cup in Qatar to 48 teams, an undertaking fraught with complexity amid an ongoing diplomatic and economic standoff between Qatar and a group of its Gulf neighbors.","A study conducted by FIFA recently found Qatar, a desert state smaller than Connecticut, could not host an event with 16 more teams on its own. Unless the blockade — led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — is lifted, only Oman and Kuwait could be considered viable partners in the region. But both countries would be required to spend significant amounts on the infrastructure required to meet FIFA standards.","Greg Clarke, a FIFA vice president from England, told the meeting that FIFA must consider the human rights records of any additional host country, according to people present at the meeting. Qatar has been forced to adopt new workers regulations amid a backlash over its treatment of construction workers building the stadiums there. That scrutiny would likely shift to its neighbors, Clarke told the council members.","“How can you not think of human rights wherever you go? It must be an issue,” said Evelina Christillin, a FIFA Council member from Italy.","A delegation from Qatar, which was awarded the World Cup almost a decade ago, was also present in Miami. Hassan al-Thawadi, the executive responsible for 2022 World Cup preparations, said Qatar remained open-minded about expansion, provided it benefited Qatar as much as it did FIFA. He failed to answer when asked to provide one example of a benefit that his country could derive from an expanded tournament.","“We are open to exploring the options,” al-Thawadi said, adding it would be a “big, big challenge” to host a 48-team event if the blockade, now in its second year, continued. FIFA must make a final decision at a meeting of its 211 members in Paris in June; qualifying for the tournament begins that month, and teams and federations would need to know how many places are available.","Should the World Cup be enlarged, FIFA would need to play six matches per day to ensure the tournament can be completed within 28 days, a stipulation it agreed with European clubs after moving the tournament to November to avoid the searing Gulf summer. That would mean rest periods for some teams of as little as 48 hours, and a potential risk to athlete’ health, according to the largest players’ union, FIFPro","“At international competitions like the World Cup, the minimum rest period between matches must be maintained at 72 hours,” FIFPro said in a statement."
FIFA’s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It. - The New York Times,FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.,"Since proposing several major changes to the sport’s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA’s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments — an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams — that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.","The listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA’s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption — and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA — would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.","Each of the meetings on Infantino’s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer’s six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.","Infantino’s problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views.","Some of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA’s tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams.","Ceferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA’s Champions League and add to the workload of players.","“I cannot accept that some people who are blinded by the pursuit of profit are considering to sell the soul of football tournaments to nebulous private funds,” Ceferin said in a speech last May. “Money does not rule — and the European sports model must be respected. Football is not for sale. I will not let anyone sacrifice its structures on the altar of a highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism.”","Infantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogotá, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank’s Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.","European leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote.","The vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami.","At the last summit, in Morocco, Infantino expressed frustration to the officials who declined to take part in the vote for his plans, according to multiple people present at the meeting.","“As part of this discussion, people are asked to give their feedback on a series of proposals and, as in any democratic consultation process, every member can express its opinion freely,” FIFA said in a statement. “The feedback received will be fed back to the Council together with the results of the other consultation platforms.”","FIFA’s task force for the two tournaments will hold its next meeting on Feb. 21 in Rio de Janeiro. As tensions grow, however, there is a chance that European executives will not attend, according to a person familiar with the continental leaders’ plans.","UEFA declined to comment. The organization has been seeking the support of European clubs and leagues to oppose Infantino’s proposals. At the last two meetings, Ceferin has arrived armed with signed letters of opposition from The European Club Association, a union of the continent’s top clubs, and a separate group representing the continent’s domestic leagues.","The proposals to expand the Club World Cup and to create a new global Nations League similar to the recently created UEFA version largely have the backing of officials from South America, Africa and Asia — likely enough to win a vote should Infantino choose to take one at the Miami meeting. Any such move would exacerbate the growing rift with Europe, however, and potentially lead to a larger crisis if top clubs and leading nations from UEFA refuse to participate in the new FIFA-controlled tournaments."
Jesse Marsch’s Study Abroad Program - The New York Times,"LEIPZIG, Germany — Upon moving to Germany from the United States last summer, Jesse Marsch, his wife, Kim, and their three children made a pact of sorts regarding their new life abroad: When a situation that felt foreign made them want to turn inward, they would challenge themselves to do the opposite, to turn outward and embrace it, to accept and understand it.","Such discomfort has been precisely the point for Marsch, the very reason he diverged from an ascendant coaching path in the United States last summer and sought out the unknown across the Atlantic Ocean.","In July, Marsch left his job as coach of the New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer to accept a post as an assistant coach for RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga. While unquestionably a step up in competition, it was, in some respects, still an unconventional move, and Marsch said even some of his friends in soccer asked him if taking a job as an assistant might be a step backward.","But what represents a step backward, and what is the convention, when you are navigating a mostly uncharted path? Because while opportunities for American players in Europe continue to expand, there is not yet much of a road map for what Marsch wants to be: an American coach who builds a long, successful career in one of the continent’s top leagues.","And so he has chosen to seek out that challenge, to take chances and to face the unknown and the unfamiliar head on.","“I’ve gotten more comfortable,” he said, “with being uncomfortable.”","After decades of battling stereotypes and preconceived ideas about their abilities, American players have, slowly, found a level of acceptance in European soccer. One of the players Marsch brought into the Red Bulls’ first team, for example, was viewed even here as a solid addition when he joined RB Leipzig this month. That player, the 19-year-old Tyler Adams, and other American prospects now head to the continent in waves, and in general the professional pathways there have become well worn and widely available.","A similar process has yet to unfold for American coaches, however. There are no set pathways, and there are few pioneers.","Marsch regards one of them, Bob Bradley, as the “biggest mentor” in his career, and he has found Bradley’s experiences instructive. From 2014 to 2016, Bradley held head coaching jobs for clubs in Norway, France and England. Looking back, his stint abroad was as notable for the milestones he set for American coaches — he was the first American to coach a team in England’s Premier League — as it was for the relentless stream of misgivings from fans and pundits in whatever new locale he landed. (Bradley’s Premier League tenure lasted all of 11 games.)","“The perception of Bob, I think, when he was here is that he probably wasn’t as knowledgeable because he’s from America, that his accent and the way he talked about football may have brought questions up within fan bases about how do Americans think about football, how do they talk about football, even use the word football,” Marsch said. “All those things are unfair, but they’re realities we have to deal with.”","That is what Marsch knows he is up against now, and it is the reason he says he has tried to take a holistic approach to this new chapter of his life.","Under RB Leipzig’s manager, Ralf Rangnick, Marsch has assumed what he described as a fluid, all-encompassing role. At the same time, he is responsible for a weekly set of tasks — running different elements of training, game analysis and opponent preparation — whose strict implementation he has found exhilarating in a way only a knowledge-hungry coach can.","While RB Leipzig and New York’s Red Bulls are both technically part of the same corporate sports empire, his first months experiencing the nuances of German soccer culture — the structure, the specificity, the attention to detail — reiterated for him how much he still can learn.","“It would have been easy for me to stay in New York,” Marsch said about his last job in Major League Soccer, where he spent three and a half seasons and compiled the most wins in franchise history. “But in the end, that wasn’t really what I was interested in.”","Instead, Marsch, who had begun the process of obtaining his UEFA pro coaching license in 2017, accepted an offer to join the Leipzig coaching staff and left the Red Bulls in midseason. Rangnick, an experienced coach and former Red Bull sporting director, is in his second stint leading Leipzig but plans to coach only for this season. The club has previously announced that Hoffenheim’s Julian Nagelsmann, a rising star in German coaching, will take over this summer.","“I know the league, the team and I speak the language,” Rangnick said when he returned to the bench. “That isn’t the case yet for Jesse Marsch, so that’s why he will be working as an assistant coach.” Still, the club noted specifically when it hired Marsch that he had signed a two-year contract, with the expectation that he would continue in the role once Nagelsmann arrives.","Until then, Marsch has been stockpiling professional experiences like a backpacker collecting souvenirs. That mind-set was one reason he was not interested in pursuing the United States national team coaching job, which still sat vacant when he left for Europe. Marsch wants to hold the position one day, he said, but only after he has accumulated more experience.","Now, he said, it better that the American soccer ecosystem put its collective support behind the coach who was chosen, Gregg Berhalter, and move away from the negativity that seemed to infest its culture in the past year.","“If I were to be critical of the sport in our country in general, I think we have failed ourselves miserably because everyone is the smartest guy in the room and everyone is the biggest critic, inside the game and out,” he said. “And that will never be successful.”","Marsch also said he hoped more of his coaching peers from the United States would pursue unfamiliar pathways and leaps of faith, like the one he is taking now, so that opportunities for American coaches in the top levels of the game might one day seem as plentiful as they have become for players.","Adams is one such player, and Marsch said he was eager to throw new challenges at him, too. Adams made his debut for RB Leipzig in a friendly during Germany’s winter break, and was included in the first team for this weekend’s game against Dortmund, though he was an unused substitute in Leipzig’s 1-0 defeat.","“When you see this kid up close every day, it’s almost like you’re watching a weed grow by the second,” Marsch said of Adams. “That’s how he is. You throw something difficult at him, and he eats it up and spits it out.”","These days, Marsch takes German language lessons three times a week and uses the language in coaches meetings and with players on the field. While he has improved, he said, the process also has made look, at times, “like a fool.”","But those minor indignities, he noted, could serve as positives within a team context.","“I think it’s an important lesson in an leadership position to show that you’re willing to be vulnerable, you’re willing to make mistakes, and that’s how I’m going to get better,” he said. “I think that’s the same thing we want to portray to our players: ‘We all mistakes. You’re going to make mistakes. But let’s all learn from them. Let’s get better together.’”"
Athletic Bilbao Is Flush With Cash and Facing Relegation - The New York Times,"BILBAO, Spain — Europe’s midseason soccer transfer window is open this month. For teams battling relegation, and potential financial ruin, it brings a last, vital chance to strengthen a leaky defense or fortify a goal-shy forward line ahead of the second half of the season.","Among those teams is Athletic Bilbao, which is in 17th place in La Liga, the 20-team Spanish league, and already on its second manager this season.","Financially, Athletic, a century-old power on Spain’s northern coast, has little in common with the clubs that find themselves in a similarly grim position. The team is flush with cash, with about 200 million euros, or about $228 million, in reserves, and has access to another 90 million euros that — if deployed to lure talent from soccer’s global marketplace — would probably go a long way toward firing it up the league standings and out of danger. But unlike almost every other team in the market, Bilbao cannot spend those millions on just anyone.",Athletic is a throwback. Tradition dictates that it can only field players who were born in the Basque Country — territory that includes seven provinces that stretch from northern Spain into France — or who moved to the region in their youth and learned to play soccer here.,"That purity has been a point of pride for the 121-year-old club. Athletic Bilbao has long celebrated that it has never been relegated from Spain’s top league, a feat it shares with only Barcelona and Real Madrid. But it is only one slot away from relegation position in La Liga, and its purity presents obvious difficulties when it comes to recruitment. Lately it has placed the team in a financial vise, transforming it into something of a unicorn in a sport in which nearly every other club is desperate for cash. Bilbao, with its flush coffers and narrowed options, has become soccer’s poor little loaded club.","“We don’t really need the money,” Josu Urrutia, a stocky, 50-year-old former Bilbao midfielder, said in an interview last month, shortly before he ended a seven-year run as Athletic’s president.","His replacement, Aitor Elizegi, though critical of some of Urrutia’s decisions, was quick to confirm that the team’s commitment to Basque-only players would not be changed.","Athletic can in some ways blame its recent success for its current fate. In the last eight years, the team has played six seasons in the second-tier Europa League (reaching the final once) and one in the Champions League. In 2012 and again in 2015, it reached the final of the Spanish cup.","The success of those largely homegrown squads quickly drew interest from bigger clubs, in Spain and abroad, and led to tough decisions for a conveyor belt of young, talented players. When the club’s management had any say, the answer to any inquiries to negotiate a multimillion-euro sale was a simple one: no.","Athletic, at least under Urrutia, never negotiated, whatever the price. Players would leave only if their buyout clause — a fee that would trigger a sale — was met, and Athletic’s management hoped it never would be.","Urrutia, sitting in an austere drawing room full of lacquered furniture on the ground floor of a mansion built in 1900 and bestowed to the club by one of the city’s historic trading families, described how the club lost defensive midfielder Javi Martínez to the German giant Bayern Munich a year into his presidency in 2011. This all happened after he tried to ignore Jupp Heynckes, then Bayern’s manager, who had coached Urrutia, a tough tackling midfielder during two spells at Athletic, and Bayern’s top two officials, Karl Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness.","“Jupp says, ‘We consider Javi is a player for the future, and 40 seems a lot; we are ready to pay 22 or 23,” Urrutia recalled. “We said: Perfect. So we don’t have to worry ourselves about it.”","In the end, Bayern paid the full 40 million euro buyout fee for Martínez, a sum that broke Germany’s transfer record.","Since then, the team has lost other players in a similar fashion. Ander Herrera, another defensive midfielder, joined Manchester United in 2014. Defender Aymeric Laporte became Manchester City’s costliest acquisition when he joined for 65 million euros. Most recently, Chelsea made Kepa Arrizabalaga the most expensive goalkeeper in the world after paying his full 80 million euro release clause.","All those deals, regardless of the fee, frustrated Urrutia. He wished all of Athletic’s players shared his values. Urrutia came through the club’s youth system and never wore another jersey in a two-decade career. The club, he said, tries to instill loyalty from the moment players enter the system.","Athletic officials like to play the guilt card and remind players that the Basque-only policy was probably the reason they were able to have a professional career in the first place — that the club could have picked other, better athletes if it had the option of shopping on the global market.","“It’s as though you’ve left the family business started by your granddad,” Urrutia said.","Urrutia and others explain that if players who came before the current ones had decided to leave, the club might have been forced to change its mission. If that had happened, Basque players might not have gotten their chance. The players should live these values, they said.","Money plays a role as well. Athletic now pays some of the highest salaries in Spain, far more than teams of an equivalent standard, Urrutia said. He said the average annual salary of a first-team player was four million euros.","When faced with replacing a departing player, the club always gives first preference to products formed at its Lezama academy, a world-class facility six miles outside Bilbao, the largest city in the Basque region. In each of the last five seasons, at least two academy players have graduated to the first-team roster.","“We give them opportunities to play for the first team even when they’re too young, because we need them,” Urrutia said.","Some players, so committed to the club’s philosophy, like midfielder Iker Muniain, 26, who has had offers to leave, have shunned the opportunity to play elsewhere. Just before Christmas, Muniain, an attacker who has been with the club for more than a decade and scored Monday, signed a new contract and asked that it have no buyout clause. “I’m pleased to do it,” he said. “We’ve had cases in which colleagues have left and people have felt sad and touched. This is a way for me to demonstrate my loyalty to the club.”","Occasionally, the team does have to turn to the transfer market. The options are limited to players born in the Basque region or those who trained here during their formative years. That allows sellers to take advantage of Athletic’s limitations.","This season, the team agreed to pay Paris St.-Germain a fee that could eventually reach 24 million euros for defender Yuri Berchiche, a defender who joined the French team from Real Sociedad for about eight million euros less just a year earlier.","“They know, and they try to squeeze us because they know that there are not so many possibilities for us,” Urrutia said. “We don’t have so many options in the transfer market.”","Athletic can afford this because only four teams last season received more money from Spanish television rights, which, for now, is determined by how often a team’s matches are shown. But a new distribution model aimed at reducing inequalities between teams is narrowing that gap. In the past, the biggest teams could get as much as 12 times more than others. That ratio is down to about 3.5.","Though the change is generally considered to be a positive one, it disproportionately affects Athletic because far smaller teams can now trawl the world for talent they could not afford before, boosting their squads, while Athletic remains committed to its local-only policy and other quirks that make it unique.","Its headquarters bear little resemblance to those of most teams. No brash logos, no video screens showing loops of historic success, no shop hawking memorabilia. Like the club, it is a throwback.","There are small if understated markers, like the modernist painting hanging on a wall inside a ground floor reception room. It depicts a great flood that has overwhelmed an entire city. The only visible structure is an arch resembling one from Athletic’s former stadium that was delicately moved to its training ground. It is a symbol, club officials say, that the team’s past will always be a part of its present and future, whether it risks relegation or fights for titles.","“We know the challenge: It’s a solitary challenge,” Urrutia said. “This is a voyage full of difficulties. There could be a tsunami, but at the end, we really believe in the strength of our boat and want to keep going.”"
Has the Premier League Transfer Bubble Burst? - The New York Times,"MANCHESTER, England — At last, it seems, among all of the hundreds of millions of pounds that float around the Premier League, the penny has dropped.","The January transfer window has come and gone, barely noticed. There has been no orgy of excess, no frantic scramble to spend as much money as possible, no broken transfer-spending records, no helicopter dashes, no late-night drama.","For once — for the first time, perhaps — English soccer has been a model of restraint and of prudence. For once, it has looked not at price, but at worth. As one executive at a Premier League team told The Times of London, “People are asking crazy money for average players.”","That, of course, should hardly have come as a shock. The clubs in the cash-soaked Premier League, with its lucrative broadcasting deals and its seemingly bottomless pit of wealth, had no sooner helped to create soccer’s superheated transfer market than they began to suffer from it.","In England, managers and technical directors and chief executives whisper darkly of an “English tax,” claiming that their counterparts on Continental Europe routinely quote them higher prices than they would a team from Germany, Italy or Spain.","In public, those working in sales or recruitment in Europe dismiss that allegation — two sporting directors told The Times in 2017 that they work “with one price in mind” for a player, regardless of origin or destination — but there can be little doubt that, at the very least, many see English teams as easy marks.","In part, that is to their credit. According to one executive at a Bundesliga team, selling to a Premier League club is a much more straightforward business than offloading a player to Italy or Spain: The money is invariably paid upfront, one lump sum deposited into your account upon completion of the deal, rather than an installment plan contingent on a host of clauses. It is also rather more palatable to fans: Clubs in Germany, he said, have broadly welcomed English interest in their best players simply because the alternative is seeing them move, with dread predictability, to Bayern Munich.","That is not, however, the limit of its appeal. The evidence is anecdotal but nonetheless compelling: Europe’s clubs see the Premier League as a cash cow, and its member clubs as rather deeper of pocket than they are of thought.","There are, for example, executives who tell stories of hanging up the phone to a Continental team and then immediately doubling the asking price when an English club calls. There are sporting directors who recall scarcely being able to conceal their glee when a Premier League team asks to buy one of their players, or the celebrations when they complete a deal for a vastly inflated price.","And there is the manager who was presented with a tall South American forward by his club’s owner a few years ago and told that it did not matter if the deal worked out, because even if he did not score goals, “an English team will come and buy him for more than we paid anyway.”","There will be plenty, then, who will see the drip-feed of small-beer deals and loans-with-an-option-to-buy that have populated this January transfer window and believe that it is just an exception, something cyclical, that come summer, the Premier League will be showering its largess on Europe once more.","It is worth noting, though, that year-on-year spending last summer was down, too: barely noticeable in the raw figures — £1.2 billion ($1.57 billion), as opposed to £1.4 billion in 2017 — but in the context of a global market that had been distorted beyond recognition by the fee Paris St.-Germain paid for Neymar, an eye-catching drop.","As unlikely as it sounds, the possibility has to be considered that the Premier League has finally managed to shake its reflex reaction to spend its way out of any problem, to break free of its shopaholism, to overcome its addiction to the short-term high of a lavish transfer.","It would be reductive to attribute that to one cause; it is the result, in all likelihood, of a confluence of factors. Few in soccer, for example, believe that the uncertainty that has infected most British industries because of Brexit has had much of an effect, but it is hard to believe the weakness of the pound against the euro has not given at least some clubs pause.","Then there is the assumption in the Premier League that English soccer’s television boom might have plateaued, and that the next broadcast deal will not deliver the exponential rise in income to which the clubs have grown accustomed. That, too, may have persuaded clubs to become just a little more frugal.","If certain clubs have chosen not to spend — Liverpool and Manchester City for fear of disrupting the delicate harmony they have established, Manchester United because a permanent manager and a technical director must be appointed first — others have been unable to do so.","In the case of Tottenham, with a new stadium to consider, and Chelsea, subject to a FIFA investigation over rule breaches related to young players, those circumstances are bespoke; for others, the issue is much broader. The short-term cost-control measures established by the league’s clubs effectively link increases in a team’s wage bill to growth of its commercial revenue; that Arsenal, for example, has not increased the latter means it is not in a position to throw money at the former.","None of that, though, explains why everyone has been so parsimonious, so uncharacteristically cautious. Yet the trend is widespread enough to suggest that there has been a more fundamental change, that English teams no longer suspect they are being taken for a ride, but know they are, and are determined to put a stop to it.","England for many years stood as a last, defiant bulwark against the idea that recruitment should be overseen not by a club’s manager, but by a technical — or sporting — director. Such an appointment, it was thought, would only undermine the authority of the man tasked with picking the team; in a country that sanctified the memories of Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough, the manager’s position was inviolable.","That is no longer the case. Of the elite, only Manchester United does not have a technical director, and it is in the process of finding one. Away from Old Trafford, most teams have moved to bring in an individual or a team of people to sift through data, to compile scouting reports, and to assist — to choose a euphemism — the manager with recruitment. The days of a coach being allowed to bring in players on a whim are over.","It is not a perfect system, but it is designed to prevent a club’s having to resort to last-minute purchases, desperate rolls of the dice. It is structured to make clubs less wasteful, more efficient. Its corollary is that it attracts managers more accustomed to working with what they have, or what they are given, rather than demanding money be spent to solve problems that have proved beyond them.","And this is its effect: a handful of unremarkable deals, players brought in to cover a particular need rather than to meet a vague desire, over the course of a month that does not warrant the comic, childlike pomp and ceremony England usually reserves for the transfer window. A dull January is not a cause for concern. It is not a sign of a lack of ambition, but the hallmark of a league that is getting that little bit smarter, that at last is thinking with its head, rather than its pocket."
Manchester City Delivered a Lesson. Will Chelsea Learn This Time? - The New York Times,"MANCHESTER, England — As he trudged, wordlessly, away from the field, away from the crowd, away from the burning humiliation, Maurizio Sarri looked like a man who knew. He is not the first in his position to have worn that look, to have made that walk, to sense that, sooner or later, Chelsea has a decision to make.","In these circumstances, that ordinarily means only one thing. Historically, when Chelsea is presented with the choice of whether to fire a manager or not, it tends to act as if it has no choice at all.","Roman Abramovich has fired managers early and fired them late. He has fired them after winning the Premier League title but not the Champions League; he has fired them after winning the Champions League but not the Premier League. He has fired them against the fans’ wishes, and he has fired them to their intense relief. He has fired them for less than being beaten, 6-0, by Manchester City, as Sarri’s Chelsea was on Sunday, and he has fired them for more.","Abramovich has been through 13 permanent managers since he arrived in English soccer in 2003. By this stage of this season, Abramovich — or, more pertinently, those who run Chelsea at his behest — knows the signs. Not just the obvious ones: the back-to-back collapses away from home, first at Bournemouth and now in Manchester; the inexorable slide down the Premier League table, initially out of the title race and now, usurped by a resurgent Manchester United, out of the Champions League qualifying places.","There are the subtle ones, too: Not once, but twice since the turn of the year Sarri has criticized his players publicly, questioning both their mentality and their motivation. After a 2-0 defeat to Arsenal last month, he took the unusual step of making his public comments through a translator, just in case he could not find quite the right phraseology as he laid bare his complaints about his squad.","It is a risky strategy, one with the air of a final throw of the dice. It is telling, then, that there has been no visible uplift in performance since Sarri’s public intervention; if anything, things are getting worse. Chelsea has still not scored a Premier League goal away from home in 2019; Sarri’s team was, if anything, somewhat fortunate only to concede six on Sunday.","That, too, does not bode well. When he arrived from Napoli — belatedly, after a long legal tussle between Chelsea and his predecessor, Antonio Conte, that is still not resolved — Sarri warned that his methods were sufficiently bespoke that the players might need some time to adapt to them. There would be, he admitted, teething troubles.","Curiously, they were not immediate. Chelsea hit the ground running. Eden Hazard declared himself delighted to be playing — at last — for a manager who prioritized attacking soccer, who might let him have the “fun” he seeks.","The problems came later, Sarri’s prediction coming good on a satellite delay and the season slowing to a halt as winter set in. It is as if Chelsea’s players have unlearned what Sarri taught them, as if they tried his way for a while and then decided, actually, no, this wasn’t right for them.","This is familiar ground at Chelsea: the manager and the players drifting apart, the words no longer seeming to carry weight, the instructions and ideas not quite cutting through. The same thing happened to José Mourinho, in 2015, and then to Conte, last year. Everybody knows how the story ends; it is not with the players moving on.","Sarri, judging by his demeanor at the final whistle Sunday, recognizes that. This is the sort of result, he will know, that brings with it immediate jeopardy, that provides compelling evidence to support his dismissal. There is, though, an equally convincing case to be made for precisely the opposite, an argument that might make Chelsea pause, even as it begins to prepare the severance check.","It runs like this: Manchester City has what Chelsea has always craved — not just success, but sustained success, consistent success, an unwavering direction. More than that, it has a distinctive, immediately apparent style, an enviable character and identity, a devastating beauty.","It is not that Chelsea has not been successful, of course: Abramovich has brought five Premier League titles to Stamford Bridge, one Champions League crown, and more F.A. Cups than anybody would want, too. Chelsea still outstrips City, the two great transformative clubs of modern English soccer, in terms of honors won.","But Chelsea’s has been a boom-and-bust kind of success, bountiful years followed invariably by fallow ones — one that is the result not so much of a carefully crafted plan but of the harnessing of chaos. It has long seemed fragile, somehow.","City’s is different. City has had a little chaos in its time too, of course — the firings of Mark Hughes and Roberto Mancini, the existence of Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli — and its prominence was hard-won, just a little slower than many might have expected given the riches injected into the club by its Emirati benefactors.","But now, a little more than a decade since their arrival, the path is set. City may not win the Premier League title this year — this victory showed just how well Liverpool and Tottenham have done to keep pace with Pep Guardiola’s team for this long — but it will at least come close. It will be the favorite to lift the trophy again next year, and the year after that. It is hard to imagine City slipping to sixth in the near future.","That is a consequence of the amount of money spent on the club, but it is also testament to the way that money has been spent: building a team that is capable of playing the sort of soccer Guardiola preaches, that rival players — and fans — look on with envy, that takes the breath away.","That is what Abramovich has always wanted for Chelsea. It is why he pursued Guardiola for so long, why he appointed André Villas-Boas in 2011, supposedly cut from the same cloth, and why he brought in Sarri last summer.","It is not just a latent aestheticism, it is also an economic argument. The sort of identity that City has brings results; not always, not every year, but over the long term. It helps lure new signings, and it pinpoints who, precisely, those players should be. It staves off the need to fire managers every year or so, to rip up the blueprint, to start again by scouring the transfer market for new players or asking old ones to learn new tricks. A defined identity staves off the turmoil of a poor run of form, of a disappointing season — the difference between a detour and a road to nowhere. It means there can be certainty where otherwise there may be doubt.","The problem, of course, is that it takes time. Even Guardiola, as it turned out, needed a year to shape City into what he wanted it to be, and that was with a team that had been built with him in mind, long before he joined. It requires patience, and understanding. It cannot be conjured over a summer, or over a season. It does not materialize if you keep firing your manager.","That, then, is the choice that Chelsea faces. Fire Sarri, and the boom-and-bust cycle will be prolonged. And perhaps that would be the right decision: Perhaps he is too inflexible to succeed in England; perhaps what he achieved at Napoli cannot be repeated; perhaps his tactics have been worked out by opponents, and he has nothing more up his sleeve.","At some point, though, Chelsea will have to do the opposite. It will have to stick with someone, to accept that time is just as important as money, to go through a fallow year in the hope that bounty follows. It wants what City has. To get it, it must start to do what City does."
"For Christian Pulisic and Dortmund, Chelsea Transfer Was a Team Effort - The New York Times","MARBELLA, Spain — It was just after lunchtime on Tuesday, and Christian Pulisic was facing a rare free afternoon. There was a nap in his plans, for sure, and maybe dinner at a local restaurant afterward.","Pulisic was in this southern Spanish town, bracketed by mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, for a weeklong training camp with his German club, Borussia Dortmund. The sun was shining. Waves skimmed across the beach. Any leisure time was to be cherished.","“This is always fun,” he said about German soccer’s annual winter break, when most teams pack their bags and go in search of a week of warm-weather training abroad. “It’s a week to get away, get some sun, just to change things up a little bit.”","It was also, he acknowledged with a laugh, most likely the last time for a while that he would enjoy this particular type of holiday rest.","Last week, Pulisic announced that he would leave Dortmund — the only professional club he has known — at the end of the season to join Chelsea of the English Premier League. They have winter breaks in Germany; in England, they do not.","It is one of the countless changes, some small and many big, that the 20-year-old Pulisic will encounter in his planned move to the supercharged world of English soccer. It is a situation he says he relishes, a personal milestone in a young career already full of them.","“This was a big dream of mine,” Pulisic said of playing in England, “and I feel this was the right time to make this step.”","Pulisic announced his move himself on social media with an open letter to Borussia Dortmund fans. In it, he declared, with a “heavy heart,” that he would move to London after finishing the remainder of the season in Germany. He referred to Dortmund as “(y)our world-famous club,” the parentheses at once reflecting the deep ties he formed with the team, which signed him at age 16 and is the only professional club he has known, and his looming exit.","Pulisic, who was born in Hershey, Pa., said he took great care to get the wording of the letter right, working with a team staff member to make sure a German translation posted at the same time captured the message’s nuances — and made clear his deep gratitude to the club and its fans.","“The five years I’ve been at Dortmund have been unbelievable, and I don’t want them to think that I took any of that for granted,” Pulisic said. “It’s not going to be easy for me to leave. I’ll miss it here.”","In the United States, where every turn in Pulisic’s career can be viewed through the prism of what it means for the American national team, news of the transfer generated a splash befitting the country’s best player. The fee Chelsea paid for Pulisic, 64 million euros (about $73 million), was the highest ever paid for an American player, more than tripling the previous mark.","Pulisic acknowledged the enormousness of the figure, and the expectations that come with it, but he brushed aside the notion that it might burden him.","“In the soccer world, especially now with these numbers you have, who really knows who’s worth what?” Pulisic said. “It is what it is. They wanted me obviously enough to pay that much, but I’m just excited to go there and give my best.”","As transfers go, the deal was a congenial one. Borussia Dortmund had approached Pulisic last summer about extending his contract, which had two years remaining. But Pulisic signaled that he was hoping to move on.","Michael Zorc, the team’s technical director, was disappointed. But he also knew such a day would come: Pulisic had never been shy about his ambition to play in England.","So Dortmund and Pulisic quickly set about moving forward with parallel goals: the club hoping to maximize the value of an attractive young asset still under its control, the player trying to make sure his dream move landed him in the right place.","“There was a lot of trust in these talks,” said Zorc, who said multiple clubs expressed interest in Pulisic and that at least one other Premier League team was willing to pay Dortmund’s final asking price.","His transfer will bring an end to three remarkable years at Dortmund. As a 17-year-old, he broke into the club’s first team and promptly became the youngest non-German to score a Bundesliga goal. But his rise slowed somewhat this season as injuries and the emergence of other young players diminished Pulisic’s playing time. Zorc said he suspected the transfer negotiations had distracted Pulisic this season — “maybe his mind was not so clear” — but hopes the resolution will have a positive effect on the field. Pulisic agrees.","“I feel much, much clearer in my head now that all this is passed,” he said about making the deal public.","Pulisic has five more months to contribute at Dortmund, which leads the Bundesliga with 42 points — 6 ahead of Bayern Munich — through 17 games. After that, he will continue his development at Chelsea, a club not particularly known for nurturing young players.","Still, it was not lost on Pulisic — or his father, Mark, who worked closely with him to evaluate his transfer destination — that Chelsea’s roster situation, with several forwards potentially moving on this summer, could work in his favor.","“Of course that was part of the equation: You look at what a team is going to look like over the next few years,” Mark Pulisic said. “Chelsea will be having some turnover due to the ages of players. But, at the end of the day, that doesn’t matter. When you’re at the highest level of your sport, there’s going to be new competition coming in constantly.”","Mark Pulisic also said the recent narrative that his son’s acquisition by Chelsea had been completed without the knowledge of the club’s Italian coach, Maurizio Sarri — an impression fueled by a television interview in which Sarri implied he had been left in the dark about the move — was “far from the truth.”","“We obviously met with Sarri for quite a long time,” Mark Pulisic said. “We had a chat with him. Christian got to meet with him for a bit, and it just felt good.”","The resulting move will represent a return of sorts for Pulisic, who spent a year with his family in Tackley, England, when he was 7 years old.","His memories from that year are few, but vivid: winning a few tournaments with the youth team he joined, going to professional games with his father, wearing his soccer uniform all day at school, playing on a concrete soccer court afterward for hours.","And he noted one more, rather obvious, benefit to the move: “I’m excited to go be able to speak my first language on a day-to-day basis,” he said, laughing. “Something as simple as that, you don’t notice it, but it’s nice at times.”"
A Champions League’s Changing of the Guard Leaves Behind Two Fixtures - The New York Times,"BARCELONA, Spain — In the last eight days, an era has ended, a dynasty has been dismantled, an aristocracy has crumbled and a balance of power that held for a decade has shifted. Change has swept through the Champions League. European soccer’s landscape has been transformed. Not that it was easy to tell from Barcelona last night. Here, where the hosts thrashed Lyon, 5-1, on Wednesday, it all felt the same as ever.","This has been a tumultuous week. The peak came right away: Real Madrid — the team that had held this competition in its thrall, seemingly incapable of not winning it, its opponents apparently dazzled by the mythology of those bright white jerseys — humbled, at home, by a young and vibrant and entirely dismissed Ajax.","The next night, Paris St.-Germain fell, the prize its Qatari backers covet more than any other once again proving elusive, despite the cushion provided by a two-goal lead from the first leg and the insurance policy of a squad assembled at extravagant expense.","There might, ordinarily, have been some solace in being eliminated by one of Europe’s true giants, Manchester United, but that would only have applied if it had been Manchester United’s first team. It was not. It was a patchwork, scratch sort of a side, cobbled together with what little material Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had at hand, and it was still enough.","And then, on Tuesday night, that other great cornerstone of European soccer — Atlético Madrid’s defense, so miserly and obdurate — came unstuck. It was generally held to be inconceivable that a team as disciplined and well organized and gnarled as Diego Simeone’s could contrive to throw away a two-goal first-leg lead, but contrive to it did. “It was not a lack of character,” Simeone said in Turin. “Juventus was just better than us.” He has not built his reputation on such acquiescence to defeat.","Wednesday brought one more: Bayern Munich beaten comfortably on home territory by Liverpool, its players and coach, Niko Kovac, admitting that they had deserved no more. For the first time in 13 years, there will be no German teams present on Friday when the draw for the quarterfinals is made. There will be four representatives from the Premier League, for the first time in 10.","No wonder, then, there is a sense that the guard is changing, that this will prove to be the season that bridges two distinct ages. The time of this incarnation of Real Madrid has passed, most obviously, but perhaps that can be said of others among the clutch of superclubs who have, for the last decade, dominated the latter stages of this competition, too.",Bayern is gearing up to rejuvenate its squad. Atlético will lose the player that has best encapsulated its recent history — the grizzled Uruguayan defender Diego Godín — this summer.,"As they stumble, the English rise: Manchester City’s destruction of Schalke cemented its place as the favorite to inherit Real Madrid’s crown; Liverpool reached the final last year, and is a more rounded, more durable side this time around. Tottenham beat Borussia Dortmund in both legs, displaying a maturity it has previously lacked. Manchester United, reborn under Solskjaer, has a sense of abandon and fun that makes it dangerous.","The Premier League is, at last, benefiting not only from its vast financial advantage over the rest of Europe, but from its decision — belated, admittedly — to spend a rather greater proportion of that on managers, rather than players.","That is one reading of the situation, anyway. It is not the only one. The Champions League is about teams, of course, and about dynasties and eras and power bases and all of that, but more than anything, it is about players. Indeed, if the dominance of Real Madrid taught us anything, it was that, currently at least, this is a competition defined by individuals more than by systems. And those individuals have not changed at all.","On Tuesday, it was Cristiano Ronaldo, scoring yet another hat-trick to pull Juventus clear of Atlético, to send the Allianz Stadium into raptures, to deliver on the reputation that convinced the Italian champion to spend somewhere north of $100 million on a 33-year-old forward last summer.","And on Wednesday — obviously — it was Lionel Messi, scoring twice, creating twice, and orchestrating Barcelona’s demolition of a courageous, fearless but utterly outgunned Lyon.","For a while, the French visitor discomfited Barcelona; for a while, there was a gentle draft of change here, too, if not quite a full wind. Lyon defended valiantly, and counterattacked with zest, before Barcelona broke the deadlock — a Messi penalty, deftly, almost thoughtlessly, chipped past Anthony Lopes.","For a few minutes in the second half, too, Lyon had hope: Lucas Tousart had made it 2-1; a single strike, a bounce of a ball, would have been enough to add Barcelona to the list of giants toppled this season. It did not last long. Messi soon snatched it away.","His second goal — a delicate shot at the end of one of those mazy dribbles where the ball seems to fall completely, hopelessly under his spell — effectively killed the game, before his two assists, for Gerard Piqué and Ousmane Dembélé, helped a victory bleed into a rout.","But that is not what stood out. What makes Messi so captivating is that it is not just the killer blows that count, but all of the jabs and the thrusts and the parries. It is watching him dance around and skip over and ghost away from tackles. It is the precision of his passing, his unerring ability to make the right choice. Messi rarely tries the spectacular, the unlikely: he does not abuse his status, his talent. He just makes sure he does everything, almost everything, right. His gift has always been his simplicity; that is not fading, not at all, not yet.","Eras do end, and times do change. Identifying when is not an exact science, of course: they tend to drift into each other; there are rarely clean breaks. But perhaps it is fair to say that Real Madrid’s period of dominance is at an end, or that the age of the superclubs has been put on hiatus, or even that Spain’s pre-eminence in European competition (every Champions League title since 2014, and 7 of the last 10) is over.","But it is equally possible that none of those eras existed in the first place, and that instead they were simply consequences of the age of Messi and of Ronaldo, their teams the beneficiaries of their greatness, their ability to decide games and define seasons. That has not changed. Their age is not over yet. Everything might look different. Messi and Ronaldo, though, are still the same."
Qatar Cuts Through Tension and Defenders to Beat Saudi Arabia - The New York Times,ABU DHABI — The message to the D.J. was short and to the point: no Arabic music.,"That was the edict from the organizers of the Asian Cup match here on Thursday, an attempt to limit even the opportunity for a flash point in the first soccer match between Saudi Arabia and Qatar since the start of a bitter political feud nearly two years ago. The dispute, and the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, has so divided countries in the region that even the prematch music at the tournament is now viewed through that prism.","At other matches at the Asian Cup, the most important soccer event on the sprawling continent, the soundtrack has included music from the participating countries. That was not the case Thursday at the Zayed Sports City Stadium, where the sound system blasted western dance music in an effort to avoid even the risk of inflaming tensions between rival supporters.","In the case of Qatar, that support was limited to a Korean woman, a male student from China and band of Omanis who arrived during the second half after acquiring free tickets. Almost no Qatari fans have traveled to the tournament amid the blockade of the tiny emirate by a Saudi-led group of its neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates, that has made travel extremely difficult — and entry into the U.A.E. close to impossible.","In the end, in front of a stadium that was mostly empty — despite Saudi officials’ handing out free tickets and bussing in fans — Qatar was a comfortable 2-0 winner. The game was largely tension-free until Qatar’s exuberant on-field celebrations led to a minor skirmish with a despondent Saudi striker, one of few players from his team who did not head straight to the dressing room after the referee blew the final whistle.","Coaches from both teams had tried to play down the political cloud that had hung over Thursday’s game since the teams were drawn into the same first-round group months ago. After the game, they steered a similar course, brushing aside any questions related to matters out of their control, and instead focusing on the challenges awaiting them in the knockout rounds. Qatar, which won the group, will face Iraq; Saudi Arabia faces a more difficult game against Japan, a regional power.","“It has nothing to do with football so I won’t give a response,” Juan Antonio Pizzi, Saudi Arabia’s Argentine coach said in response to a question about the off-field tension. Félix Sánchez, Qatar’s Spanish coach, conceded only that hearing his team’s national anthem roundly jeered by most of the fans was a “difficult moment” for his players, but he concluded the game was played in a positive spirit on the field.","Controversy flared outside the lines, however. Local organizers were said to have reacted with fury after a commentator on the Qatar-owned network beIN Sports mentioned the blockade during the live broadcast of an earlier Iran-Iraq game. In response, the Saudi Sports Media Federation released a statement Thursday accusing beIN, which is broadcasting the tournament across the Middle East, of using its exclusive rights to push its political agenda.","The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have been in lock step in their opposition to Qatar, and that divide was visible in the stands. Behind the goal where Almoez Ali, the tournament’s top scorer, delivered the first of his two goals for Qatar, three men stood for the entire match, holding aloft two flags, one a Saudi one and the other Emirati, fused together.","Saudi efforts to boost crowd numbers included commandeering two desks at the entrance of the Bab al Qasr hotel, situated yards from the U.A.E.’s presidential palace. There, officials armed with fist-sized stacks of tickets, distributed them for free to fans — whether Saudi or not — with only one request: Support Saudi Arabia.","The efforts largely fell flat. The attendance was declared at just over 16,000, though the actual number of fans appeared far lower. Qatar had almost none: a Qatar soccer federation spokesman said as many as 2,000 fans would have made the trip in normal times. In the end, Qatar had to make do with a small and curious collection of followers that included Janko Yang, a 23-year-old Chinese student who grew fond of Qatar’s soccer team after its under-23 squad visited his hometown, Changzhou, last year.","At the other end of the stadium, Mary Lee, the Korean communications worker who has become relatively well-known around the team, had somehow snagged a seat in the media area. Sporting a silk dress she had made in the maroon and white colors of Qatar’s flag — a direct challenge to rules that forbid public support of Qatar in the U.A.E. — Lee, 45, vowed to stay at the tournament until her adopted country completes its run. (Asked to change clothing by security officials before she attended the tournament opener between the U.A.E. and Bahrain, Lee has been given dispensation to wear her elaborate outfit only at Qatar’s games.)","The most voluble support, though, came from the group of Omanis who had raced across the city after watching their team clinch berth in the knockout rounds with a 3-1 victory over Turkmenistan. Beneficiaries of the free Saudi tickets, they cheered Qatar’s players as they celebrated their victory. Oman has historically enjoyed a friendly relationship with all its neighbors, and has adopted a neutral role in the Gulf dispute.","“We are like one country, we are one people in the Gulf, and we are cheering for them because they haven’t got fans here,” said Abdullah Moqubuli, 30, before adding that he and his friends would have cheered for Saudi Arabia, too, had the Saudis managed to score a goal.","Sánchez, Qatar’s coach, acknowledged their contribution after the match.","“We appreciated it and we want to thank them because it’s important to us to have also some people with the team,” he said. Qatar’s captain, Hassan al-Haydos, had a similar message for Yang, the Chinese student.","“I’d like to thank him, and tell him to come to the next game,” al-Haydos said."
"For U.S. Women’s Team, Higher Bonuses Raise the Stakes for Each Match - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES — When the members of the United States women’s national team negotiated their current collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer in 2017, they secured what seemed to be a significant victory on match bonuses.","In addition to seeing those bonuses increase as much as sixfold for winning certain games, the players no longer needed to win to collect extra pay. For the first time, they would also earn bonuses even if they tied matches against top-tier opponents.","The compromise — ceding some guaranteed compensation from salaries in exchange for higher performance bonuses — helped break a deadlock in negotiations amid a broader fight over pay equity and working conditions, a battle that recently moved to federal court. But the players also decided the arrangement was a calculated risk worth taking: Playing for one of the world’s best teams, they view every game as winnable. And with each victory set to be worth as much as $8,500 per player, the bonuses brought the potential for tens of thousands of dollars in extra income.","Yet two years after striking their deal, the players are coping with the reality that winning isn’t always entirely within their control. Experiments with roster selections, starting lineups, tactical formations and even substitutions by Coach Jill Ellis — all within her purview and part of the normal evaluation period between major championships — have led to uneven performances and to frustration within a team that now has large payouts on the line every time it takes the field.","During the two years since the new C.B.A. took effect, in fact, the team has missed out on roughly $1.7 million in performance bonuses — sometimes as much as $200,000 for a single match. For some players, that is as much as $74,250 each. The analysis of bonus pay is based on figures contained in the team’s C.B.A., which has not been released publicly.","“We have a very bonus-heavy structure, purposefully — we win a lot of games and expect that we’ll win a lot of games,” forward Megan Rapinoe said. “That is part of the balance, understanding that we have a lot of money tied to wins and especially wins against top teams.”","The payments, which for the first time are based on the quality of a given opponent, are worth a maximum of $8,500 per player for a win against the four top-ranked teams in the world, plus Canada, and up to $1,750 for a draw. Against a tier of opponents ranked Nos. 5 through 8, wins are worth $6,500 and draws $1,250. If the Americans beat a team in the lowest bonus tier, like Sunday’s 6-0 thrashing of Belgium, each player on the roster earns a bonus of $5,250.","Lose, though, for any reason, and the players on U.S. Soccer contracts get no bonus at all.","Asked about how experimentation may cost the team short-term results — and thus, bonuses — Ellis said her priority has been looking long term and leaving no stone unturned before the World Cup.","“You want to win,” Ellis said, “but I’d rather get every box checked.”","It is also worth noting that the team isn’t losing more than it has historically; from the end of 2017 to the start of 2019, the United States even went on a 28-game unbeaten streak. But with each result now carrying a higher price tag for each player, the unpredictability created by abrupt experiments by Ellis has been unsettling to some in the locker room.","Ellis’s experiments have varied, including using three-back systems that featured a midfielder, Allie Long, as a center back, or others that pushed wing Mallory Pugh into a central midfield role for the first time against several of the world’s top teams. Once, Ellis asked Crystal Dunn to play three positions in a single match.",When there was a reprieve from such tests during the team’s World Cup qualifying tournament last year — Ellis kept her approach simple as the United States bulldozed through the event — the players noticed.,"“You’ve seen a lot more consistency in the lineups and within the roster, so we’re seeing more consistency on the field and on the score sheets,” Alex Morgan said at the time.","But once the Americans clinched their spot in France, the tinkering resumed, and it has continued, even as the World Cup nears.","“Sometimes it’s O.K. to sacrifice results in terms of performance to get the best out of the team and figure out what that is,” Rapinoe said last week, “but we’re probably past that point — or we should be.”","The players were aware of the potential downside of their new C.B.A. even before they ratified it two years ago: A month before the players approved the deal, which retroactively covered all results in early 2017, they had been trounced at a new tournament, the SheBelieves Cup, while struggling to adapt to a new tactical system.","The team lost the SheBelieves Cup again this year when continued tinkering by Ellis resulted in draws against Japan and England. Because the tournament also offers a $5,000 bonus per player for a first-place finish — another carrot in the new C.B.A. — the team missed out on a total of nearly $400,000 in combined bonuses over a single two-week period.","“The paycheck was a little light last month, that’s for sure,” Rapinoe joked last week. “Unfortunately.”","Those paychecks, though, represent the optimistic stance the team took in its C.B.A. negotiations in 2017. With U.S. Soccer unwilling to increase guaranteed salaries, the team sought other ways to increase its compensation and maximize the upside of future success. Unlike their men’s counterparts, however, the women’s players do not have large club salaries to fall back on if they get injured, fall out of favor or — in a worst-case scenario — miss out on the biggest bonuses by failing to qualify for the World Cup.","That made the women’s new C.B.A. a stark departure for a team that had prioritized the stability of guaranteed pay. But it also means that a single poor performance now stings far more than it used to, even if it helps Ellis collect valuable insight.","Ultimately, though, the prize that matters most to the players is winning the World Cup. If they successfully defend their world title this summer, all the dropped results and experimenting will have been worth it.","“If we just breeze through and beat every team, 2-0 or 3-0, we’re not going to learn anything,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn said. “It’s good to get players who don’t have a lot of experience playing time. It’s good to play different formations and see if it works, or not, against the top teams in the world.","“I see a lot of value in the losses, the wins and the ties.”"
Three Days in Paris With the Designer Combining Sportswear and Couture - The New York Times,"On a Monday afternoon in mid-March, in the mezzanine office of her studio near the Ménilmontant neighborhood of Paris, the French designer Christelle Kocher pauses briefly to re-bedazzle her blue acrylic nails. She carefully pulls a diamanté out of a pile and, using tweezers, daubs it with glue and then applies it to her nail bed. “I have to touch them up, as a few have fallen off,” she says.","Kocher, who founded her eponymous line, Koché, in 2015 — and who also currently serves as the artistic director of the Parisian Métiers d’Art feather and floral embroidery house, Lemarié — is known for her mastery of rich embellishment. At Lemarié, she collaborates with luxury houses such as Chanel, Dior and Valentino, festooning their haute couture garments with feathers. For Koché, she brings her hands-on crafty sensibility to streetwear-inspired ready-to-wear, finessing nylon sports jackets with lace inserts and encrusting catsuits with studs and Swarovski crystals. “I love the culture of couture, and I am fascinated to see how I can continue the story and make it more contemporary with a relaxed attitude,” she says. “To create a new vocabulary between these worlds.”","[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]","Her fall 2019 collection, presented in Paris last month, was perhaps her most apt mash-up yet — a pastiche of iconic sportswear fabrics and racy graphics mixed with evening wear in the form of bias cut gowns assembled from deconstructed soccer jerseys (representing 19 soccer teams all around the world) and bike shorts paired with a sequin-and-satin tuxedo jacket. Some of these looks heralded Kocher’s new collaboration with Nike, a partnership that reached full bloom at a sports-star-studded fashion show last week, at which Nike unveiled 14 national team soccer kits for their sponsored women’s teams, ahead of the Women’s World Cup in Paris this summer. Featured alongside the new team uniforms were 13 one-off looks — dresses, jerseys, track pants and bodysuits — that Kocher designed and spliced together from an assortment of Nike women’s soccer jerseys specifically for the occasion.","An alignment with Nike seems like a natural fit for the designer, who was an avid athlete throughout her teenage years in Strasbourg. She played in the French Junior League for handball from a young age; now, she runs in the nearby Buttes-Chaumont Park almost every day. “Sports really helped me to develop my personality: I was a very shy kid, and it gave me this sense of team spirit,” Kocher says. “I liked the comfort of the clothes as well, and I think that has influenced me a lot.”","Still, high fashion, not sportswear, has been the constant on her CV. After studying at Central Saint Martins, Kocher clocked up experience at Chloé, Dries Van Noten and Bottega Veneta — the latter while also juggling her role at Lemarié, where she has honed her skills in applied crafts. “The history is so interesting because it developed through women who obviously were always working on it from home,” Kocher says of the art form. Though there was a moment when she was tempted by a cleaner aesthetic, she has stayed her course. “I read a lot about the feminist art movement of the ’70s, the work of Louise Bourgeois and Sheila Hicks, and I realized they used craft as a medium for emancipation and empowerment,” she says.","After the Nike World Cup show wrapped at Paris’s Palais Brongniart, Kocher describes how proud she was to have U.S. soccer star Brandi Chastain, the 10-year-old British skateboarder Sky Brown, the German boxing champion Zeina Nassar and the South African track-and-field gold medalist Caster Semenya modeling her garments. “We wanted to bring together different athletes of different nationalities, generations and disciplines, and this is very much the same message I have at my show: this diversity and inclusivity,” she says.","The following day, we’re in the decorous salons of the Mona Bismarck American Center, an exhibition space in Paris, which Nike has taken over for the day. Here, guests are invited to follow Kocher’s lead and customize their own soccer jerseys using an array of hardware, fabrics and patches. The space hums with a sense of excitement — adults given leave to dabble in craft — and Kocher, decked out in a patchwork tuxedo suit with satin lapels from her fall 2019 collection, roams around the room offering up tips. Though she works on 12 collections a year (eight for Chanel and four for her own brand), it is here, when she’s fixated on the minutest details, that she seems most in her element."
"At Real Madrid, a Dynasty’s Fragility Is Laid Bare in 90 Humbling Minutes - The New York Times","Memory has a tendency to smooth over the edges, to conceal the blemishes, to dust over the pockmarks. Hindsight can be distorted, and history with it: Knowing how something ended creates the illusion it was always going to end that way, a narrative reverse-engineered from the bare facts, happenstance prettified to look like destiny.","And so Real Madrid — the Real Madrid of Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric, of Zinedine Zidane and Florentino Pérez — will be immortalized as the team that was champion of Europe for more than a thousand days, the first team since 1990 to repeat as European champions, the first since 1976 to win the European Cup three times in a row, the winner of four of the last five editions of club soccer’s most prestigious tournament.","It will be remembered as a team that built an empire and defined an era, a team that swept all before it right up until the point that a vibrant, fearless Ajax Amsterdam arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu and brought it all crashing down in one night, the Dutch team’s 4-1 victory in the last 16 on Tuesday sending Real Madrid out and shock waves around Europe.","But though the score line — the extent of the rout as much as the identity of the team that administered it — was eye-catching, the fact that it felt like an impossibility is, to an extent, a trick of the memory.","Real Madrid’s dominance of the Champions League has been more fragile than the trophy cabinet and history books make it look. Lifting the club’s 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th European Cups was not an inevitability, the manifest destiny of a club that thinks of itself as the king of Europe.","The best example is the first: Real Madrid was a few seconds from losing that final, against Atlético Madrid in Lisbon; only a 93rd-minute equalizer from Sergio Ramos took the game to extra time, and gave Real Madrid a reprieve.","But there are more, far more. In 2016, just a few months into Zidane’s tenure as coach, Real traveled to Wolfsburg for a quarterfinal. It seemed a favorable draw, as close to a gimme as the Champions League offers at that stage. Real Madrid was down, 2-0, within 25 minutes, and secured a place in the semifinals only in the 77th minute of the second leg, with Ronaldo striking a pose as he celebrated his hat trick. Real would win the tournament that year, beating Atlético again in the final in Milan, this time on penalty kicks.","The next year, its progress to the final in Cardiff was stately, serene, but that final hurdle was anything but. Real eventually beat Juventus, 4-1, but if that implies an overwhelming superiority, it did not feel like that inside the Principality Stadium. Indeed, for a time, after Mario Mandzukic had drawn Juventus even in the first half, Real Madrid seemed to be swaying. Its players would later admit that they needed to regroup at halftime.","And then last year, when Real almost conspired to throw away a three-goal lead against Juventus in their quarterfinal, edged past Bayern Munich in the semifinals thanks to a momentary lapse in concentration and ability from the stand-in goalkeeper Sven Ulreich, and then overcame Liverpool — and the even more hapless Loris Karius — in the final in Kiev.","None of that, of course, is to suggest that Real has ridden its luck, or to lessen the significance or glory of its triumphs, or to claim that what happened against Ajax on Tuesday, as the Bernabéu bypassed the rage it usually reserves for defeats and fell straight into grief, was only a matter of time.","Real Madrid deserves its place in history, and its most recent generation merits its reputation as a dynasty team, one perfectly calibrated in talent and temperament to excel on soccer’s most exalted stage. But that history does not need to be airbrushed, to have all trace of blemish surgically removed.","It has been tempting, these last few years, to see all of Real Madrid’s close shaves, its flirtations with disaster, as proof of inherent greatness: a team that knows exactly what to do to win, that always finds something more when it is required, a group of players whose gifts can guide them out of any situation.","That is true, too, though it is not the whole truth. What Wolfsburg and Juventus and Ulreich and the rest prove is that Real Madrid’s grip on the competition was not as viselike as it seemed. It was, at times, only the bounce of a ball away from being loosened entirely. What Ajax did on Tuesday Juventus might have achieved a year ago, but for one moment, one slip, one whistle.","Those blemishes matter, not because they can be deployed as false harbingers of what was to come against Ajax, or because they serve to diminish Real Madrid’s status, but because they act as proof that all those trophies were achieved not because of destiny but because of the players, and coaches, involved.","Real Madrid does not have a divine right to win the Champions League. It was not carried to Lisbon and Milan and Cardiff and Kiev, and to constant glory, by its reputation or its aura or its history. It was carried by Ronaldo, his significance only highlighted by his absence, and his own refusal to countenance defeat, his desperate quest for greatness; and by Zidane; and before him by Carlo Ancelotti, and his subtle, shrewd, unspoken ability to elicit the best from the best.","Real Madrid could easily not have won four of the last five Champions Leagues. At times, it has been hard to explain — particularly in an age when soccer is enthralled by complexity, by philosophies and systems — quite how it has done so. Perhaps that is why it has been so easy to revert to thoughts of a special bond between this club and this competition, to start to believe in destiny. How easily it might all have come apart was illustrated perfectly on Tuesday, how fragile even the supreme can be. That it did not, for so long, is what this team will be remembered for; the picture will not be complete, though, without the pockmarks, the blemishes, the edges, ragged and rough."
Ronaldo and Juventus Will Avoid U.S. Amid Rape Investigation - The New York Times,"Organizers of a high-profile summer tournament for world soccer’s biggest club teams have decided to keep Juventus and its star Cristiano Ronaldo away from the United States this year, eliminating the risk of the Portuguese star’s being detained by the authorities as part of a rape investigation in Las Vegas.","While the bulk of the games in the tournament, the International Champions Cup, will take place in the United States as usual, Juventus’s games will be a part of the Asian version of the annual event. Juventus will be joined there — most likely in China and Singapore — by the Premier League teams Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.","Ronaldo, a five-time world player of the year, is in his first season in Italy’s top league after Juventus paid more than $114 million to acquire him from Real Madrid last July. Only months after his transfer, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had reopened an investigation into accusations by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, who said Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 and later paid her $375,000 for her silence.","Ronaldo and his lawyers repeatedly denied the rape accusation when it emerged in September; Ronaldo labeled it “fake news” in a video posted on one of his social media accounts, and at one point his lawyers threatened to sue the German newsmagazine that was the first to publish Mayorga’s accusations. Juventus stood behind its star, too, expressing appreciation for his “great professionalism and dedication” and saying Mayorga’s accusations “do not change this opinion.”","Juventus has a multiyear agreement to play in the International Champions Cup, which is organized by New York-based Relevent Sports. Ronaldo’s legal troubles played a role in shaping plans for Juventus’s participation, according to people familiar with this summer’s schedule, which will be released next week.","A spokesman for Juventus, which is on course to win an eighth straight Italian league championship, said “going east” to Asia was normal after spending recent preseasons in the United States.","While preseason tours are not seen as serious competition, they are vital for teams’ preparations ahead of the new season, and Juventus would have drawn unwanted scrutiny had it traveled to America without Ronaldo, its star attraction.","The case against Ronaldo resurfaced after the German magazine Der Spiegel said it had obtained confidential documents related to the case, and the purported payment by Ronaldo to settle it, from the whistle-blower platform Football Leaks. Around the same time, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had reopened its investigation into the rape accusation, following up on information it said had been provided by the victim.","Ronaldo, now 33, was a star at England’s Manchester United when he met Mayorga, now 35, at a Las Vegas nightclub in 2009, just before his record-breaking transfer to Real Madrid. He invited her and others to his suite in the early hours of June 13, 2009, she said, where she says he sexually assaulted her.","A number of the documents Mayorga’s lawyers say support her claim were published by Der Spiegel, which also published a lengthy interview with Mayorga. Ronaldo’s lawyers have questioned the authenticity of some of the documents published by Der Spiegel, but have not denied that Ronaldo and Mayorga had a sexual encounter, which they contend was consensual.","According to her lawsuit, Mayorga reported an assault to the police later that day and underwent a medical examination, during which evidence was collected in what is sometimes known as a rape kit. The Las Vegas police have acknowledged that Mayorga filed a report and was examined, but the police said she did not name her attacker at the time. The case was reopened at Mayorga’s request in September."
Emiliano Sala’s Body Is Recovered From English Channel - The New York Times,"The body of the Argentine soccer striker Emiliano Sala was recovered from the plane that crashed into the English Channel last month, the British authorities said late Thursday.","The body, recovered a day earlier from the channel, was identified by the coroner for the County of Dorset, England, the police said in a statement. The police said that the families of Mr. Sala and the pilot, David Ibbotson, had been informed.","“Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time,” the police said. Mr. Ibbotson was the only other person who was on the small plane.","The recovery crews from the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch tried to retrieve the wreckage itself, but bad weather forced them to give up, investigators said in an earlier statement. Privately funded search teams had also joined the search for Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson.","Mr. Sala, 28, who had recently transferred to the English Premier League club Cardiff City from Nantes in the French league, was flying to Cardiff from Nantes on Jan. 21 when the single-engine, propeller-driven Piper Malibu vanished.","Mr. Sala had sent an audio message from the plane to a group of friends on WhatsApp, saying that he was “so afraid” and that the plane “seems like it’s falling to pieces.”","The authorities called off a search on Jan. 24. But efforts resumed after more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000, was raised from donors, including some of soccer’s most prominent players.","On Sunday, a shipwreck hunter, David Mearns, announced that his team on the ship FPV Morven had found the plane. Another ship, the Geo Ocean III, used a remotely operated vehicle to film the wreckage, and images of the registration number on the fuselage confirmed that it was the missing plane.","Mr. Sala had been one of the leading strikers in France this season. Cardiff City, which has one of the Premier League’s lowest goal totals, had signed him in an effort to improve its poor offensive production.","The Welsh team agreed to pay 15 million pounds, or more than $19 million, to acquire Mr. Sala. Nantes has demanded payment of the first installment of that transfer fee, which is to be paid over three years, the BBC reported on Wednesday."
"Tottenham, Pochettino and the Cost of Everyday Excellence - The New York Times","LONDON — At the start of February, Lionel Messi broke another record. When Messi converted a penalty against Valencia, a few minutes before halftime, it was his 20th Liga goal of the season. He had reached that mark every year for the last 11 years. No player had done that before.","It is a fairly common occurrence, of course, Messi breaking a record. He broke two others in December: reaching the most wins for Barcelona, overtaking Xavi Hernández, and becoming the first player to score 10 Liga goals in 13 consecutive seasons. November, by contrast, was quiet: He only broke one, for Champions League goals scored for a single club.","Sometimes, he etches his name on significant milestones — highest scorer in Spanish history; most goals in a calendar year — and sometimes his feats seem more like statistical quirks, curious pieces of trivia: no player has scored two goals in more La Liga games than Messi, for example. All of the records, though, serve as testament to his greatness. Each one offers further proof of the consistency of his brilliance.","And yet the more records he breaks, the more remarkable his career becomes, the less impact each new mark has. Messi’s scaling heights previously thought unimaginable, surpassing marks once deemed indelible, is now so frequent as to be mundane. Messi rewriting the history books is the natural order of things. His excellence has been normalized.","What he has done, in effect, is a sort of impish, Argentine equivalent to what, in politics, is known as shifting the Overton Window; in public discourse, it refers to the gradual process of taking concepts previously considered unthinkable and making them first seem feasible and then, finally, ordinary.","The Messi effect works on the same lines. Before he and Cristiano Ronaldo made a habit of scoring unfathomable numbers of goals, it was assumed that such tallies were impossible. The more they have done it, the more they have made it seem attainable. The more attainable it seems, the less special it looks.","If the worst consequence of the phenomenon, for Messi, is that his splendor is occasionally a little underappreciated — something that is more of a loss for those watching than it is for him — for others, suffering the same genius fatigue, the consequences can be more severe.","This week, Tottenham faces Burnley, Chelsea and Arsenal in the Premier League. It must, most likely, win all three games to keep within touching distance of Manchester City and Liverpool in England’s rocket-fueled title race.","So fine are the margins that even a single slip may prove fatal, and once again condemn Spurs Manager Mauricio Pochettino and his team to accusations that they lack the cutting edge, the carat mass, to shine among the elite. Pochettino, like Messi, will suffer because of the standards he has set.","It is worth considering, though, the nature of Tottenham when Pochettino took over in 2014: that Tottenham was a team deep in the shadow of its two fiercest rivals, Arsenal and Chelsea; one that only occasionally featured in the Champions League; one that few, even among its most ardent fans, considered genuine contenders for the Premier League title.","Over the course of Pochettino’s almost five seasons at the club, all of that has been transformed. Tottenham is now, certainly, a better team than either Arsenal or Chelsea. It has become a fixture in the Champions League, with a place in this season’s quarterfinals well within its grasp.","Since Pochettino took charge, only one team — Manchester City — has won more points in the Premier League. Twice, Tottenham has mounted sustained challenges for a first English championship since 1961. This season, it has managed to cling to the coattails of City and Liverpool, both of whom have more points at this stage of the season than all but a handful of teams in history.","Given those circumstances, the season Pochettino has overseen thus far may rank as his finest yet. When the transfer window closed on Jan. 31, Tottenham became the first team in Premier League history not to add a single player over the course of an entire campaign.","If that parsimony was extreme, it was not out of character: Since Pochettino arrived in May 2014, Tottenham has spent barely half of the amount lavished on Manchester City and Manchester United’s squads. The sale of midfielder Mousa Dembélé in January meant that, since Pochettino arrived, the club has invested less than $30 million, net, in the transfer market.","On several occasions in recent months, that has seemed set to curtail the club’s ambitions. Pochettino has had to navigate several weeks without Harry Kane and Dele Alli, the lodestars of his attack, because of injury. In January, he lost Son Heung-min, the captain of South Korea’s national team, to the Asian Cup, too.","The club continues, unhappily, to play its home games at Wembley, after a series of delays on the completion of its new stadium, now likely to be available in April at the very earliest, though even Pochettino seems to suspect even that target is ambitious. He suggested earlier this month that it would be “tough” to play there before the start of next season.","That Tottenham is still there, then, its breath on the necks of Manchester City and Liverpool yet again, is a remarkable feat. And yet, just as with Messi, it does not always feel as though it is celebrated as such.","Pochettino, like Messi, has changed the parameters of a conversation. He has made the extraordinary ordinary. It was previously unthinkable that Spurs might be title contenders. Now, it is not just accepted but almost expected. Indeed, the question more often posed to Pochettino is whether his team is falling short because it does not yet have a trophy to show for its progress.","There is some validity to that question. As the Sky Sports commentator Jamie Carragher pointed out earlier this season, when this Tottenham team comes to be remembered, fans will not take into account where it played its home games or how much was spent to reinforce it; they will simply ask what it won. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that its relevance is overplayed.","Soccer, like all sports, is about the creation of collective memories. That is why England continues to hold its twin cup competitions in such high esteem, though winning them is often not enough to save a coach’s job or build a player’s reputation or slake a fan’s thirst for success. It is why Pochettino’s bullish disregard for them — in words, if not always in actions — strikes such a discordant note among many commentators.","But soccer is also about pride, and status. What Pochettino has done is restore both to Tottenham. That is not some meaningless intangible: It has concrete consequences, both in the stadium the club is building, a monument to its new reality, and the players it will, at some point, be able to attract there.","Pochettino has not won anything, but he has created a club that expects — and is expected — to do so in the future. He has fundamentally altered the fabric of the place that he found. He has made what was once unthinkable entirely feasible, and he has done it so often that his brilliance has become mundane. It is easy to be fooled into thinking this is normal. It is not, and the best measure of how extraordinary it is may well be how ordinary it seems."
"P.S.G. Outclasses United, at Last Blending Grit With Its Goals - The New York Times","MANCHESTER, England — That sinking feeling, that sense that it was all happening again to Paris St.-Germain, might have set in a couple of weeks ago, when Neymar limped off a field in Strasbourg, his face crumpled with tears, the fifth metatarsal in his right foot broken.","Or it might not have come until a little later, until last weekend, until the point when Edinson Cavani, wincing from the pain in his hip, was told he would not be able to return to the field at the Parc des Princes for the second half of a Ligue 1 game against Bordeaux.","Or maybe it was not the injuries, but the composite effect of them: Maybe it was the slow drift in P.S.G.’s performances these last few weeks — their first domestic defeat of the season, at Lyon; being taken to extra time in a cup game by Villefranche, a third-division team; squeezing past Bordeaux, once Cavani had gone.","It all pointed in the same direction: that just as the mercury was rising and thoughts were turning once again to the Champions League, the most ambitious club project in Europe, the team that has distorted the transfer market and — allegedly — bent the rules in its relentless pursuit of success in this competition, was splintering and fracturing and crumbling once again.","Suddenly, it felt as if a meeting in the last 16 with Manchester United was rather more daunting than it had seemed when the draw was made, back in December, back before Neymar’s tears, back before Cavani’s grimace, back before Villefranche.","That was partly because of P.S.G.’s travails, of course, but partly because United looked reinvigorated. More than that, in fact: United looked like a completely different team, with completely different players, the gray clouds of José Mourinho’s moody, miserable tenure replaced by the unending sunlight of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.","Solskjaer had not lost a game as United manager before Tuesday’s visit from P.S.G. He had restored Paul Pogba — a virus, in Mourinho’s estimation — to his position as one of the world’s finest midfielders. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford were thriving, too.","Old Trafford had its smile back, a predator’s grin, ready to become the latest place where P.S.G.’s finest-laid plans fell to pieces, just as they had at the Bernabeu last year, and at the Etihad and the Nou Camp in the years before that.","Old glory would, once again, trump new money; an elimination from a knockout soccer contest would once again become a morality play about the dangers of consumerism, the perils of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing.","And then, just when it was happening again, it did not. P.S.G. produced a performance not just of class but of cunning and courage, and swatted Manchester United aside, 2-0.","Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappé — this great international vision, this expression of Qatari soft power, delivered by two boys from Paris’s sprawling banlieues — scored a goal each, and P.S.G. might feel slightly disappointed not to have left with more. Later on, Pogba — against his hometown club — was sent off, meaning United’s standout performer will miss the return leg next month. With his exit, all reasonable hope of a turnaround in Paris departed, too.","As it turned out, the harbinger of what was to come here was not Neymar’s injury, or Cavani’s, or any of the other feints and misdirections offered by P.S.G. in recent weeks. Instead, it was in November, in the aftermath of the French champion’s victory against Liverpool in the opening stage of this competition.","It was then, as his players danced on the field, celebrating a victory in a group-stage game — one high on tension and fraught with traps, admittedly, but still a group-stage game — that Thomas Tuchel, P.S.G.’s German coach, saw something.","His team had not just beaten Liverpool for talent, not relied on Neymar’s virtuosity or Mbappé’s breathtaking speed; it had beaten them for effort, too. It had dug in and ground it out. It had proved, against a dogged, determined opponent, that it could fight, too. “Now, we feel something,” Tuchel said.","Those were the characteristics P.S.G. fell back upon Tuesday night in Manchester: Thiago Silva, among the club’s first wave of superstar signings, all the way back in 2012, towering in defense; Marquinhos, deployed to stifle and to shadow Pogba, dominant in midfield; the bustle of Marco Verratti, the hustle of Ángel Di María.","Those are the traits that teams need to overcome these challenges, to shine on these stages, to thrive in this competition, just as much as they need star power and sublime skill. Those are the traits that, in previous years, P.S.G. has not been able to call on. It cowered against Real Madrid last season, as if waiting meekly for its fate. It melted away against Barcelona the year before that, unable or unwilling to resist as Neymar and Lionel Messi ran riot.","It would be dangerous to suggest that this victory provided a blueprint for P.S.G.’s future, to use this exception to prove some wayward rule. This is not proof that P.S.G. is better without the world’s most expensive player, or evidence that a project built on and seduced by star power is innately flawed.","Neymar improves every team he is part of; if Tuchel harbors designs to win the Champions League, he will need the Brazilian back. Much the same goes for Cavani, as diligent and spirited a forward as might be found. Better teams than Manchester United, of which there are several, would pose more questions, and find more answers.","That Tuchel found a way to win in their absence, though, suggests that something has shifted, that the P.S.G. project has reached another stage, that after years of searching for a way to win even when all seems arrayed against them, they have found what Tuchel, that night in November, called a “new culture.” Now, they feel something. All that remains is to make sure that Neymar, and Cavani, feel it, too."
Three Tap-Ins and Manchester City Is Back to Its Old Self - The New York Times,"MANCHESTER, England — The movement is so slick that it seems almost automatic, a machine whirring to life. In the best possible way, Manchester City’s players become thoughtless, operating on muscle memory. They do not need to pause, to think: They know.","Fernandinho has the ball, midway inside Arsenal’s half. To his left, Raheem Sterling makes a run, darting outside Stephan Lichtsteiner. Fernandinho does not need to look: He knows where Sterling is.","Now Sterling cushions the ball, perfectly, back to Ilkay Gundogan, a few yards behind him, but his work is not done. He dashes forward again, in expectation rather than hope.","Gundogan flicks the ball over Arsenal’s defensive line, disorientated, straight back to Sterling. It looks like creativity, like Gundogan is extemporizing, because that is what we want it to be, because that would make it somehow magical, but the chances are it is exactly the opposite: He will have played that ball, and Sterling will have made that run, a thousand times in training, until the timing is perfect and Pep Guardiola is satisfied.","Only a few seconds have elapsed, but the trap has been set. Sterling is in, down the left side of Arsenal’s penalty area, and Sergio Agüero knows where he has to go, where he is meant to be. By now it seems, from the crowd, to be effortless, almost telepathic, but it is mechanical, really. Agüero has materialized at the far post. The ball is at his foot. The goal is open.","That was the second of the three goals that Agüero, and Manchester City, scored in a 3-1 victory against Arsenal on Sunday, though it was not especially different in style from the first or the third: The only real variation, the only distinguishing mark, was how he chose to convert. He put the first past Bernd Leno with his head, the second with his foot, and the third, though the referee Martin Atkinson did not spot it, with the help of his arm.","There was a sense of inevitability about all three of them, a dread predictability. Not because Arsenal — with its new manager and its handful of new players and its new dawn after years of elegant decline under Arsène Wenger — is still, at heart, the most generous and most accommodating of opponents, but because that goal is now City’s hallmark, its calling card.","This has been a challenging week for Manchester City. Guardiola kept his players in their changing room for some time after a defeat at Newcastle United on Wednesday, picking over the flaws that had led to their downfall. It had been a fourth defeat in nine league games; something was amiss.","Even first-place Liverpool’s failure to take advantage of the slip-up 24 hours later, Jürgen Klopp’s team drawing at home against Leicester City, brought little solace. “We said that we did not recognize our team,” Guardiola said. “The players felt it, too. We did not recognize what we were.”","What they needed, then, was a reassertion of identity, and there is no better expression of that identity — of what this City team is, or of what its manager would like it to be — than that second goal. “We have scored a lot like that,” Guardiola said after the game.","That is something of an understatement. No team in the Premier League has scored more goals from cutbacks this season, according to the analytics company Opta; 19 of City’s 66 goals this year have been scored from inside the 6-yard box. City scores that goal so often that it has become its default setting. Here, it felt almost like it was a comfort blanket, this City team’s artful, devastating version of going back to basics. Guardiola’s players do not have to think to score that goal. They can do it on autopilot.","That was true during the manager’s time at Barcelona and at Bayern Munich, too, of course: More than City’s goal, it is Guardiola’s. Perhaps, in time, just as a chipped penalty has become known as a Panenka for the man who made it famous, a far-post tap-in from a low cross will take his name.","He has done more than anyone else, after all, to evangelize its effectiveness: According to his journalistic confidante, Martí Perarnau, Guardiola has always agreed with his erstwhile Barcelona teammate Miquel Soler that a “hard, low cross across the 6-yard box is a goal half-scored.”","It is the goal he encouraged Jordi Alba and Dani Alves to help create at Barcelona, though neither needed much encouragement. It is the goal he schooled Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry in assisting in Germany, his only acquiescence to the differing quality of the two squads being that he allowed the latter pair to cross the ball in the air, rather than along the ground — sometimes.","It is the goal that has characterized City’s success, too, since he arrived here: 57 times, one of his players has scored from inside the 6-yard box in his time in England. It is as if Guardiola has discovered a glitch in soccer’s software, a gamer who has found a cheat that works every time.","Unai Emery, the Arsenal manager, would have known that is what Guardiola would try to do, what City would try to do. He is, after all, a compulsive viewer of forthcoming opponents, a dogged analyst, given to spending hours poring over video.","In the last few days, Emery would have seen that goal countless times, the footage taking on a metronomic, hypnotic quality as City worked the ball out wide, fired in a low cross, over and over, again and again. He would have drilled his defenders in how to cope with it, in what to look for, in anything and everything that might work.","But that is the thing: Once the machine is working, there is little that can stand in its way. It is the most predictable goal in English soccer, but that does not seem to diminish its effectiveness.","“They have the quality, the capacity,” Emery said, when asked if there is anything that can be done to stop Guardiola’s teams from performing their signature piece, casually idling through their greatest hit, whether knowledge can be power. “It can be hard to stop that.”"
The Truth According to Zlatan - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES — Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after a quiet off-season with his family in Sweden, returned to training camp with the Los Angeles Galaxy this winter to find bulldozers and construction crews at work on a new plaza outside the team’s stadium.","As a part of the refurbishment, the club will be unveiling a statue of David Beckham, a seminal figure in the evolution of Major League Soccer, in the plaza this weekend. Ibrahimovic, who, at 37, is nearing the age at which soccer legends are memorialized for the trophies they won and the goals they scored, said he was happy for Beckham, a former teammate of his at Paris St.-Germain and a two-time M.L.S. Cup winner with the Galaxy.",Could Ibrahimovic envision the team building a statue for him someday?,"“We’re discussing,” he said in an interview after a recent practice. “Not one — two. One in the front, one in the back. And one in the middle of the stadium. So, three!”","Ibrahimovic, the iconic striker, tends to serve up his brand of supreme confidence with a disarming smile and a subtle wink, and suddenly you feel as if you are in on the joke. Except it is not a joke. Not really. Ibrahimovic seems sincere about all the stuff he says: the boasts about his greatness; the odes to his goal-scoring prowess; the comparisons to lions and gods; the third-person soliloquies about all things Zlatan. ","Yet no matter how extreme or insightful or hilariously bold his claims become, his delivery — always with a wink and a smile, not to mention the résumé to back it all up — somehow helps it go down more easily.","Consider his line of grooming products, which includes deodorant, liniment balm and tattoo enhancer cream. Ibrahimovic said he had personally helped develop several types of cologne — Zlatan Black Nomad, anyone? — and that he guaranteed results.","“Oh, you will feel powerful, don’t worry,” he said. “They don’t need to see you. They just need to smell you.”","In the same way, one gets the sense Ibrahimovic was not joking when he pledged to “break every record in M.L.S. this season” at a recent fan event. (Asked if he had any particular records in mind, he replied, “All of them.”) And he was absolutely not joking when, upon signing with the Galaxy last March, he bought a full-page advertisement in The Los Angeles Times. ","“Dear Los Angeles,” it read. “You’re welcome.”","A few months later, when LeBron James announced that he, too, was moving to Los Angeles, to sign with the Lakers, Ibrahimovic welcomed him via his Instagram page.","“Now L.A. has a God and a King,” he wrote.","Ibrahimovic — who, to be clear, was the god in that situation — joined the Galaxy last year after star turns with European powerhouses like Juventus, Barcelona and Manchester United. Joining the Galaxy, he finished with 22 goals in 27 games but fell short of leading the team to the postseason, a disappointment for a player who has added to his collection of championship trophies — more than two dozen at last count, in five European leagues — nearly everywhere he has played.",So Ibrahimovic has created a new challenge for himself this season: to dominate on a new continent with a surgically repaired knee and countless skeptics — real or imagined — fueling him.,"“The age, the knee, not like before — all this baloney,” said Ibrahimovic, who used a more colorful word than baloney. “They trigger me.”","Ibrahimovic’s stateside odyssey was a long time coming. He recalled making his first trip to America in 1999, as a 17-year-old prodigy with Malmo, his hometown club in Sweden, for a summer youth tournament near Minneapolis. He visited Los Angeles about 10 years later, at the height of his powers, for a training camp with the Italian club Inter Milan. The team worked out twice a day, which left little time for sightseeing.","“You see the football field, you see the hotel and you see the bus,” Ibrahimovic said. “I mean, I heard that a lot of characters live in Los Angeles, a lot of personalities — actors, singers, all of this. And I was curious: Why do people live here?”","He investigated when he spent a month at the Beverly Hills Hotel with his wife and their two sons before he joined Manchester United in 2016. They enjoyed the weather and the easygoing vibe. “I think the sun brings energy, brings happiness,” Ibrahimovic said.","When he sustained a serious knee injury with Manchester United the following year, he got a rare sense of his own sporting mortality — and it persisted when he faltered during his comeback.","“It was not easy,” he said. “I didn’t feel comfortable. It was different.”","He was also eager for a fresh start. Enter the Galaxy, who signed him a few weeks into last season for the bargain-bin price of $1.5 million. Ibrahimovic’s arrival at Los Angeles International Airport was streamed live on the internet, and Tomas Hilliard-Arce, a defender then in his rookie year with the Galaxy, said he was among the viewers.","“I kind of felt like it was a big day for me for some reason,” Hilliard-Arce said, “because I got to meet a hero.”","It was soon clear to his new teammates that Ibrahimovic wanted to incorporate himself into the fabric of the team, no small thing for a player of his stature. As he prepared for his first game, the inauguration of the Galaxy’s nascent cross-city rivalry with Los Angeles F.C., he made playful small talk with Emmanuel Boateng, a young midfielder.","“I’m going to need you to score two goals today,” Ibrahimovic said.","Ibrahimovic started the game on the bench, where he sat next to Hilliard-Arce. After the Galaxy gave up two quick goals, and then another at the start of the second half, Ibrahimovic began to mutter to himself. “I think he was mostly just psyching himself up,” Hilliard-Arce said.","Ibrahimovic entered the game in the 71st minute and promptly delivered a dose of his hallmark magic: a stunning half-volley from nearly 40 yards and then a headed game-winner in stoppage time. Amid the celebrations, Ibrahimovic sought out Boateng.","“I told you to score two goals,” Ibrahimovic said. “But since you couldn’t do it, I had to do it myself.”","The rest of the season was less pleasant for the Galaxy — “Let’s say it went not good,” Ibrahimovic said — and the club regrouped by hiring a new coach, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, who was coming off a successful stint with Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, and by re-signing Ibrahimovic to a one-year deal worth a league-record $7.2 million.","“The club wanted to give me a 10-year deal,” Ibrahimovic said, “but I said, ‘One year at a time.’ Because I need to feel good physically, and I don’t want to put the club in a situation where they’re stuck with me and I cannot perform for them.”","For all his self-assurance, though, there are jarring moments when Ibrahimovic at least seems to acknowledge the toll of age and injury.","“Imagine how I was last year? And then think five years, 10 years back,” he said. “I would do the same things but repeating them 10 times more. I was a machine. You could not stop me. And this is not me trying to make myself big for you. This is who I was. I was a different animal. I’m still an animal, but I was a different animal.”","Yet even at 37, Ibrahimovic has the same gravelly voice, the same marbled physique and the same sharp edge. His teammates say that he raises the intensity of everyone around him, and that every moment on the field is a competition to him. In training, he wants to win every drill so he has bragging rights in the locker room. And he does not hide his disgust when things do not go well.","“What shouldn’t be lost in his big personality is that this is one of the best players to ever play the game,” Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, said. “And his focus on being a consummate professional is really his biggest value.”","Ibrahimovic’s transparency runs counter to the way many high-profile American athletes carry themselves. He has found that they tend to be too conscious of their image, he said — so polished, in fact, that they come off as artificial.","“I’m not an act,” Ibrahimovic said. “I will do mistakes, and I will learn from mistakes, and I will do mistakes again, and I will learn. I’m not perfect. I’m just being myself.”","He does not, for example, need to travel with a group of 20 advisers, he said. He does not need a stylist. He does not need to censor himself. He does not need to be anyone other than Zlatan, because usually that is more than enough.","“I am the real deal,” Ibrahimovic said as readied himself for a new season. “I am coming, and I am original.”"

Opinion | Running From Bahrain’s Dark Side - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Australia — I will never forget the love and support I was greeted with the moment I arrived here on Feb. 12 after spending 76 days in detention in Thailand. The combined international engagement on my case is what gave me my freedom back. I am home now with my wife, and for that we deeply thank all who played a role in my safe return.","What kept me going during these dark 76 days? Knowing that the whole world was witnessing the injustice. Millions of people saw me barefoot and shackled at a hearing in Bangkok, not because I had committed any crime — I had not — but because, I believe, Thailand’s ruling family happened to be tightening its relations with the Khalifas, the family that rules Bahrain, where I was born and which I had represented on its national soccer team. ","The shackles were humiliating. I am not a criminal, though I had been tried in absentia on what are widely accepted to be made-up charges — including the nonsensical accusation that I participated in burning a police station at a time I was playing soccer in a televised match — and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. I strongly believe my only “crime” was upsetting the Bahraini royal family by drawing attention to the failure of Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, to protect athletes, and his alleged involvement in their arrest and torture, after pro-democracy demonstrations in the country in 2011. "," I escaped Bahrain in 2014 after learning of the charge against me, and took up residence in Australia, where I was granted refugee status in 2017. Feeling safer, I often forgot there were still unfair charges against me, and my wife and I planned our honeymoon.",I arrived in Thailand only to find myself rapidly separated from my wife and confined to a detention center. ,"Many people believe that my return to Australia was a glorious victory, but to me it is only a half victory. I am safe and reunited with my wife, but I am also reminded that my dream of eventually going back to Bahrain will not be a reality any time soon.","Bahrain has only a jail cell to offer me, while Australia is now my home and its government and people have stood by me.","While in prison, I had a long time to consider how I got there. I have no doubt my imprisonment in Thailand was a punishment for my criticism of Sheikh Salman, a member of the Bahraini royal family, during his 2016 campaign to be elected president of FIFA, the international soccer organization. My highlighting of his alleged violations of human rights in 2011 likely contributed to his failure to win the election.","I am a free man now, but what about the more than 150 Bahraini athletes and sports officials who were arrested and in some cases tortured in 2011? Some remain in prison to this day. No credible investigations into these abuses were carried out.","There is a dark side to sports in Bahrain. The kingdom uses wealth and sports to whitewash its legacy of abuses, and silences those who try to draw attention to this pattern.","The activist Najah Ahmed Yousif was tortured, sexually abused and imprisoned in 2017 for daring to criticize the Bahrain Grand Prix auto race, and the journalist Ahmed Ismail Hassan was shot and killed while attempting to cover protests surrounding the race in 2012. Salah Abbas Habib Musa, a protest leader, was shot by the police during the weekend of the race, and nobody was held accountable for his death. Next month Formula One racing is scheduled in Bahrain; if the Formula One management fails to secure the release of Ms.Yousif, it should cancel the race. ","In Bahrain there are consequences for speaking up, but I am willing to take a personal risk and stand up for human rights no matter what, as are many brave Bahrainis. Don’t be mistaken, as I was when I went on my honeymoon to Thailand: I may be free now, but I and many other peaceful critics remain a target for Bahrain. Relatives of my friend Sayed Ahmed are imprisoned in Bahrain for his speaking out against the regime from his home in London. This week, Bahrain’s court upheld its three-year sentence in what the United Nations considers an unlawful act of reprisal through family connections. ","Bahrain has been emboldened thanks to President Trump, who has made it clear to Bahrain that “there won’t be strain with this administration.” The United States was in a powerful position to help end my ordeal, but instead it chose to stay silent. ","Indeed, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo traveled to Bahrain and praised the strategic partnership between the two countries, but made no mention of my case. Not only did he not mention my situation while I was still detained in Thailand, he failed to raise the issue of human rights at all. The United States had the means to use its leverage, since Bahrain is a close ally and host of the Fifth Fleet, but it failed to take a stance. Britain, similarly and shamefully, avoided offering support for my situation.","If Bahrain has learned anything from seeking to extradite me, it is that the government can arrest, torture and repress its people and countries like the United States and Britain will continue to look the other way. My case underscores Bahrain’s enormous power to flout international standards, like lodging an illegitimate “red notice” with Interpol to stop a refugee while he travels. ",It also shows Bahrain that the United States and Britain consider their own interests more important than the lives of individual Bahrainis. These countries are abandoning human rights at a time when things are worsening in Bahrain and will only continue to deteriorate.,"I am so fortunate to have been able to return to Australia and continue my life, but many other Bahrainis are not as lucky. If they received the same level of international support I did, they might be enjoying the same freedom I am now."
"At Ajax, One Star Goes, Another Is Going, and More Are Always Coming - The New York Times","AMSTERDAM — Last summer, seven of Ajax’s brightest stars were summoned to a room at the Dutch club’s training facility. Edwin van der Sar, the goalkeeper-turned-chief-executive, and Marc Overmars, once a jet-heeled wing and now the Ajax sporting director, had a video to show them.","Its premise was simple. Each of the players was paired with an iconic figure from Ajax’s illustrious history, one who shared a position, a nationality or (in one case) a bloodline. Goalkeeper Andre Onana, in one example, had van der Sar. Forward Kasper Dolberg got Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Justin Kluivert was juxtaposed with his father, Patrick. Frenkie de Jong had Christian Eriksen, and Matthijs de Ligt was compared to Barry Hulshoff, a defender from Ajax’s all-conquering team of the 1970s.","The idea, van der Sar said, was to “show them how to become a legend at Ajax, and in Holland.” The film was designed to persuade the players, the club’s crown jewels, to resist the temptation to move to England, to Spain, to Italy, for another year or so, to “stay with each other, to win prizes and trophies here and then make the next step.”",The tactic worked. Six of the seven players should feature for Ajax when it hosts Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday. De Ligt will marshal the defense. De Jong will orchestrate the attacks.,"Only one of the seven will be absent: Kluivert resisted the emotional overture to follow in his father’s footsteps. He refused to extend his contract and was sold to Roma. At Ajax, they understand why he made that decision — the allure, for a teenager with a famous name, of forging his own path — but when they mention Kluivert now, it is with a hint of regret, a tinge of frustration.","Not because he left, but because he left so soon. “If a player goes after just half a year in the first team, like Kluivert, we are disappointed,” said Said Ouaali, the director of De Toekomst, Ajax’s famed youth academy.","In January, Ajax made another video. This time, it was for public consumption, posted on the club’s social media channels. It was a little more than a minute long, but it showcased all of what Erik ten Hag, Ajax’s current manager, called de Jong’s “special qualities.” It was titled, “Frenkie Futuro,” and was released to celebrate the confirmation of the 21-year-old’s move to Barcelona, set to be completed this summer.","De Jong is the shining light of this Ajax team, a player so promising that he has, more than once, been compared to Johan Cruyff himself. Yet there was no regret at his departure. “Barcelona, enjoy the future, like we do,” Ajax wrote on its official Twitter account.","The feelings will be the same, this summer, when de Ligt — a player who has been at Ajax since he was 8 — departs, as he is expected to do. A 20-year-old defender who is regarded by some Premier League scouts as the best prospect in any position in world soccer, de Ligt could join his friend at Barcelona, or he might end up at Juventus.","Either way, there will be no sadness, no sense of loss at what might have been. Ten Hag might allow himself to wonder a little, he said, at what could happen if “I could keep them for two or three years,” into their prime, but that is it.","“I will be proud,” he said. “The scouts who found them will be proud. Marc Overmars will be proud. Everyone will be. If they transfer to a big club, you are happy for them.”","This is, of course, what Ajax has always done. Since Cruyff himself left for Barcelona in 1973, it has churned out a stream of talent for others to enjoy: Johan Neeskens, Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Kluivert, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart, Eriksen, Ibrahimovic, Jan Vertonghen, Luis Suárez. The Ajax alumni list reads like a who’s who of modern soccer.","The formula that has allowed it to do so hangs on the wall in ten Hag’s office, opposite a series of black-and-white portraits of Rinus Michels, the mastermind of the great team of the 1970s; Cruyff, its star; and Louis van Gaal, the man who restored Ajax to the European pinnacle in the 1990s, with a team reared almost entirely at De Toekomst.","Ten Hag laughs when he looks at that wall — “They set you a standard,” he said, blowing out his cheeks — but he is serious when he discusses the Ajacied, a cross between a mission statement and a creed for the club.","These are the traits the club seeks to instill in every player who wears its jersey, or who passes through De Toekomst, as well as its coaches and staff. There are 11 of them; they have been arranged like a team. This being Ajax, they are set out in a 4-3-3 formation. They range from taking responsibility and initiative to remaining disciplined and having fun.","The approach, clearly, works. No team in Europe produces more professional players than Ajax. The club’s figures put it ahead of Partizan Belgrade and Dynamo Kyiv. According to Ouaali, a staggering 86 percent of players who are at De Toekomst at age 16 will go on to have pro careers.","But that is not to say it has not been adapted, altered, fine-tuned over the years. That process started in 2011, when Cruyff returned to a club that — in van der Sar’s words — “did not feel like Ajax anymore.” Cruyff and the cadre of former players he brought with him wanted not only to restore the focus on youth development, to shed highly paid, aging players, but to change the way Ajax worked.","“We focus always on the individual,” Ouaali said. “We don’t think about age groups, like the Dutch federation or like other clubs. It can be hard for coaches because they want results as well — to be successful, to be promoted to the next step up — but we try to find coaches who focus on the development of players, who learn the individual, not the team.”","The club recognized, too, that it had to work faster than before. Players were no longer staying in the Eredivisie until they were 23 or 24; they were leaving at 20 or 21, if not earlier. “At 19, they needed to be ready to play in the first team,” ten Hag said, “because at 20, they are gone.”","That meant more physical work at younger ages, and an end to players going to school outside Ajax. Now, they study at De Toekomst, so they can maximize the hours they spend in the classroom and on the training field.","Ajax borrowed methods found in Montessori education to mix age groups, and its under-18 team was abolished to “increase pressure on the talent,” Ouaali said.","The club’s second team, Jong Ajax — which plays in Dutch soccer’s second tier — no longer would be filled with senior players; now, most of its members are still in their teenage years. “We had to speed up the process,” ten Hag said. “They had to be good quicker.”","All of it was a formal acknowledgment of Ajax’s place in the 21st century soccer firmament. It is telling, for example, that Ouaali sees his job, and that of De Toekomst, not as to produce players for the first team, but to produce them for “Ajax, then the Dutch national team, then the top international level.”","The order is important. Ajax is not just about developing players; it is also concerned with winning. Van der Sar, in particular, was keenly aware of the need to keep its protégés long enough to benefit from them. It is why he has loosened the wage budget enough to make staying around for an extra year or two appealing. It is why the club is seeking to expand its global footprint, opening an office in New York; agreeing to run a youth system at Guangzhou R&F, the Chinese Super League team; finding ways to monetize its name.","De Jong and de Ligt have done what they were asked to do when they watched that video last summer. They might not have won a trophy, but by carrying Ajax to the last 16 of the Champions League, to a meeting with Real Madrid, they have “given something back,” as van der Sar put it.","When they — and possibly other members of the seven — depart, they will go with the best wishes of the club, and then the whole system will start again.","That, after all, is Ajax’s real gift: its ability not to produce one player, or one generation of them, but to keep on going. It is what makes players’ leaving not only desirable but necessary.","“We have to give the path to the next one,” van der Sar said. “If players stay too long, the next one cannot play. The whole thing chokes.”","He cited an example from just a couple of years ago. Davy Klaassen was Ajax’s captain then. He was 24. The club had high hopes for a young midfielder, Donny van der Beek, but he needed a place to play.","“Donny was saying, ‘O.K., Davy, come on now, it’s your time to go,’” van der Sar said.","Klaassen did go: to Everton. On Wednesday, van der Beek will be in midfield against Real Madrid. Another player, another one off the production line, giving something back."
Spanish Great Villa Out to Make More History in Japan - The New York Times,"KOBE, Japan — David Villa is happy to chat about many things -- the various leagues he has played in, his family, how travel broadens the mind and even beef -- but when the question of retirement comes up, it draws only a wry smile to his face. ","Unquestionably one of the greatest strikers ever to emerge from the Spanish game, Villa has won enough medals for two or three careers but, despite having entered his 38th year, he is still hungry for more. ","So, fresh from the treatment table at his eighth club on a fourth continent, the Spanish national team's record goalscorer will offer only a nod towards his legacy when asked about hanging up his boots. ","""I don't think a lot about this now, because I am still playing, I am still creating my history,"" he told Reuters in an interview at Vissel Kobe's training centre just outside Japan's sixth largest city.","""But, if you ask me, then I would like to be remembered for... if you asked the teams that I played for then they would say a player that gives everything for the club, day-by-day in training and in games.","""(Someone who has) respect for the team, the shirt and everybody in the culture of the club 100 percent.","""That is the most important for me and is the things I have tried to do in the teams of my career, that's it.""","Villa's goals have helped win a World Cup, a European Championship, the Champions League, a hat-trick of La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey with three different clubs.","At Kobe, he has already scored three goals in five games as he bids to add a J.League winners' medal to his cluttered trophy cabinet and said anyone who expected a drop in standards was always going to be disappointed. ","""I try to lead by example,"" he added. ""I don't believe in any other way, other than working day-by-day to be stronger. ","""It doesn't matter if you're playing for Barcelona, Vissel Kobe or Sporting Gijon, where I started, or the national team when I was top of my career. ","""It doesn’t matter. The secret for me is to work day-by-day to be better and I don't have any other secrets.""",GREAT EXPECTATIONS ,"The small, quiet Kobe training centre does not look like the centre of a lucratively-funded revolution in Japanese soccer but this is where Villa and his fellow World Cup winners Andres Iniesta and Lukas Podolski come to work every day.","Bankrolled by Rakuten CEO and Japan's seventh richest man, Hiroshi Mikitani, Kobe have never managed higher than seventh in the J.League and last year, with Iniesta and Podolski on board, finished mid-table. ",Following Mikitani's investment –- 24-year-old midfielder Sergi Samper is the latest high profile recruit from Barcelona -- there is an expectation that the most expensive squad ever assembled in Japanese soccer should coast to the title.,"With three wins from their first five games of the season, Kobe are fourth in the league and trail early leaders Nagoya Grampus by two points.","Villa understands the expectation and said it was something he had dealt with all his life from his early days at Sporting Gijon, through his time at Zaragoza, Valencia, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid as well as in 98 internationals.","""The pressure for me has always existed, it doesn't matter the country, the team or the position you have in the team,"" he said.

Politics Looms Over Empty Seats as Saudi Arabia Faces Qatar in Asian Cup - The New York Times,"ABU DHABI — Qatar forward Almoez Ali joined a small group of record-makers at the Asian Cup last week, becoming only the fourth player in the tournament’s history to score four goals in a single game. His exploits in his country’s 6-0 thrashing of North Korea were cheered by just one fan sporting the Gulf country’s colors.",That was one more than team officials expected.,"That is because the Asian Cup is being played this month in the United Arab Emirates, one of the main players in the punishing Saudi Arabia-led blockade of Qatar that began in 2017 and already has led to inconveniences for visiting Qatari officials, visiting Qatari journalists and, clearly, given their tiny number, visiting Qatari fans. The looming specter of the political dispute has produced a surreal air around Qatar’s matches, one that is expected to be repeated at its showdown against Saudi Arabia on Thursday at Zayed City Sports Stadium.","Because of the geopolitical implications, that match could be one of the most-watched games of the tournament, though it will most likely not include many, if any, Qataris in the stands. The official attendance figure for the Qatar-North Korea game on Sunday in Al Ain was announced as 452, though several people who attended said the actual number most likely was closer to 100. Similarly low attendance figures have been a feature of the tournament, Asia’s most important soccer championship, in its first two weeks.","The one flag-waving fan in Qatar’s maroon colors Sunday was a South Korean woman who had traveled from her homeland to root for Qatar, according to Qatari officials. Two other unidentified men sat nearby behind a Qatari flag, a rare spot of color in a sea of white seats. The sparse crowd only avoided setting another tournament record, for the lowest attendance, because of two groups of fans bused in by North Korea’s delegation.","The soporific atmosphere most likely will give way to something far different and far more political when Qatar and Saudi Arabia meet to decide the winner of Group E. The countries have not met on the soccer field since diplomatic ties between the countries were severed 18 months ago, but the game’s location in this Emirate capital adds another layer of tension.","“That’s almost more difficult to imagine than the U.S. national soccer team playing Iran in Tehran,” said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House, a British foreign-affairs think tank. “There will be some jittery people in Qatar hoping their players make it home.”","Political intrigue large and small is nothing new at the Asian Cup. On Tuesday, Palestine played Jordan, which has been home to Palestinian refugees for over half a century. A day later, Iran faced Iraq. Yemen, which is on the brink of famine amid a prolonged Saudi-led assault on Houthi rebels, is among the first-time participants in the event.","This year’s tournament also has been accompanied by significant issues in the soccer world. The A.F.C.’s president, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, a member of the Bahraini royal family, has been assailed over his silence about the fate of Hakeem al-Araibi, a refugee soccer player of Bahraini descent who was detained in Thailand on the orders of Bahrain’s government. And the event is the latest staging point for discussions related to FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s desire to expand the 2022 Qatar World Cup to 48 teams, a move that almost certainly would require Qatar to share games with countries currently leading the blockade, as well as a simmering battle for the leadership of the A.F.C. Sheikh Salman faces two challengers: one from Qatar, and another from the U.A.E.","But the main crisis at this year’s Asian Cup remains the ongoing blockade of Qatar. The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have been in lock step in their opposition to Qatar, which they have accused of financing terrorism, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close to Iran. The countries were especially incensed by Qatar’s support for a range of activists across the Arab world, including the political Islamists that other Gulf monarchs consider a threat to their rule.","Qatar’s leaders have denied the accusations of interference and of financing terrorism, arguing that it is their country’s independence that has most angered their neighbors. But the blockade’s effects on the tournament is not difficult to spot.","Saoud al-Mohannadi, a Qatari and the Asian Football Confederation’s senior official responsible for the tournament, was initially barred from traveling to the U.A.E. on the eve of the competition. Initially prevented from boarding a flight from Oman, he was allowed through a day later. Five journalists cleared to cover the event by the A.F.C. weren’t so lucky; they were turned back upon arrival, though one photographer was allowed in. (Saudi Arabia has 47 print reporters accredited for the tournament.)",Local organizers and the Abu Dhabi Sports Council were not made available for interviews. Neither group responded to emailed questions related to the tournament.,"Complicating matters further is the tournament’s television agreement. Qatar’s beIN Sports holds the broadcast rights for the event, but several top hotels, including the guest rooms of the Fairmont, where A.F.C.’s official delegation is based, and the hotels adjacent to the stadiums refuse to air beIN’s lineup of channels.","Since the start of the crisis, beIN’s broadcasts — matches for which it has paid hundreds of millions of dollars for the exclusive rights — have been pirated by entity known as beoutQ, which Qatar contends is based in Saudi Arabia. As it did during last summer’s World Cup, beoutQ is broadcasting the Asian Cup in its entirety, overlaying beIN’s logo with its own.","Asian Cup organizers have issued statements of frustration and threats of legal action, with little effect. In Bahrain, Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, a son of the country’s ruler, posted a video on Instagram this week of his reaction to his country’s last-minute triumph against India on Monday. His chosen broadcaster, made clear by the logo on the screen, was beoutQ. (The A.F.C’s president is a member of Bahrain’s royal family.)","On the eve of the game, beIN launched a website that outlined evidence against the channel, which it describes as a Saudi-supported operation.","The broader dispute has been visible inside stadiums, too; at several, the partnership between the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia in opposition to Qatar is on display in banners that display both countries’ flags and a set of shaking hands.","What will happen on the field Thursday at the Zayed Sports City Stadium remains anyone’s guess. At an under-19 game between the U.A.E. and Qatar in October, the Emirati captain refused to shake hands with his Qatari counterpart at the pregame coin toss.","Qatari officials and players have tried to play down the political cloud hanging over their presence. They say they are focused on improving ahead of the next men’s World Cup, which Qatar will host in 2022.","On Tuesday, Qatar’s players appeared to be in good humor as they ran out to practice around sunset at a local field in Abu Dhabi, joking and teasing one another as a group of Spanish coaches put them through their paces. Apart from having no fans present at its games, the team has not faced any issues with the A.F.C. and local tournament organizers, according to a spokesman for the Qatari soccer federation, Ali al-Salat. But the players were briefed to avoid discussing politics ahead of the Saudi Arabia match.","“You might look at it as special, but in our case it’s not that special,” midfielder Salem al Hajri said in a short interview as he prepared to join Tuesday’s training session.","Asked about the political implications of the game, Saudi Arabia’s captain and its coach both demurred, saying those thoughts were for others.","“We are thinking exclusively on the sports part of the game tomorrow,” said Juan Antônio Pizzi, Saudi Arabia’s Argentine coach. “Whatever the surrounding issues, we are not entitled to talk about things off the field.”","Al Hajri and his Qatar teammates are guaranteed at least one supporter. The South Korean woman at the team’s first two matches, Mary Lee, confirmed that she would attend. Her relationship with the team is a curious one; al-Salat said she has links to the Qatar embassy in South Korea.","“We appreciate the support because she’s the only fan who holds the Qatari flag in the U.A.E.,” al-Salat said. In normal times, she would be joined by at least 2,000 Qatari fans, he said, but the regular flights between Qatar’s capital, Doha, and Abu Dhabi have also been shut down by the blockade.","Qataris now need special clearance and two layers of vetting to travel into the Emirates, where many have family members. But without direct flights between the countries, fans interesting in traveling to the Asian Cup would be required to fly through another country — typically Oman or Kuwait — as the national team was required to do on its way here. (Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family who leads the soccer federation, has based himself in Oman and flies in for his team’s games.)","Saudi’s soccer federation, meanwhile, has secured thousands of tickets for its games, but their fans’ presence has had little effect at a tournament notable for its paltry attendance figures. The lack of fans has created a strange atmosphere inside the stadiums, with loud music echoing around largely empty arenas and M.C.s who exhort those present to “make some noise.”","Despite tickets priced as low as about $7, even neutral fans are staying away. Several migrant workers, a group that heavily outnumbers U.A.E. nationals in Abu Dhabi, said their biggest obstacle was not ticket prices or geopolitical intrigue but something far more basic: As one Nigerian taxi driver said, he was just too busy.","“I’m always at work,” he said."

Cyprus FA Resumes Second Division With Warning to Clubs - The New York Times,"NICOSIA — The second tier of Cyprus soccer will resume on April 19 after a week-long suspension prompted by match-fixing suspicions, the island's soccer governing body said, giving teams a warning of points deductions and financial penalties in future.","The Cyprus Football Association (CFA) received a number of warning letters from the European game's ruling body UEFA concerning second division fixtures in early April, and announced a suspension on April 9.

Seat Cushions Believed to Be From Plane Carrying Emiliano Sala Are Found - The New York Times,"LONDON — Parts of seat cushions believed to be from the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot that disappeared over the English Channel have been found on a French beach, the British authorities said on Wednesday.","The cushions were discovered by the French authorities on Monday near Surtainville, a coastal area in northwestern France, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said in a statement.","British investigators have identified a search area of approximately four square miles based on the plane’s path and last known radar position. A specialist vessel will search the seabed for the wreckage at the end of this week, weather permitting, the statement added.","“We are aware that a privately operated search is also being conducted in the area, and we are liaising closely with those involved to maximize the chance of locating any wreckage and ensure a safe search operation,” the statement said.","Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City after emerging as a prolific goal scorer for Nantes, in the French league. The plane carrying him and the pilot, David Ibbotson, disappeared en route to Cardiff on the night of Jan. 21; Mr. Sala was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day.","An underwater search conducted by a high-tech submarine is scheduled to start at the end of the week, in what will be a privately led attempt to find the Piper Malibu plane, a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft.","The initiative to start the private operation was made by Mr. Sala’s family, after the authorities decided end the search on Thursday.","But people from all over the world have chipped in to help support of the family’s search for answers about what happened. Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Friday that by Wednesday evening had raised more than 369,000 euros, about $422,000, to aid the search.","The page has attracted a significant amount of attention, including donations by soccer stars like Kylian Mbappé, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year, and Ilkay Gündogan, a German player with Manchester City in the Premier League.","Cardiff City paid tribute to Mr. Sala on Tuesday, at its first match since he disappeared, against Arsenal in London. Players and staff wore daffodils in his honor, and his name was included in the team roster in the match-day program. Both Cardiff and Arsenal, which won the match, laid floral tributes to Mr. Sala at Emirates Stadium.","At several English Premier League matches this week, the teams observed a moment of silence in memory of Mr. Sala.","“It is very difficult to even describe how the players are feeling,” Sol Bamba, a Cardiff defender, told BBC Sport Wales.","“We have all been affected by it — the lads, the city, the whole club.”","News reports have questioned whether Mr. Ibbotson should have been piloting the plane. He held a private pilot’s license in the United States, and his medical certification was up to date, according to records on the Federal Aviation Administration’s website.","But to fly the plane in Britain with a paying passenger, Mr. Ibbotson needed a commercial pilot’s license, and to fly at night, he needed a so-called instrument rating. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority would not comment on Mr. Ibbotson’s credentials, but the authorities said the investigation into the plane’s disappearance would cover personnel records.","The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart.","“This would not have posed a problem for a pilot with a current instrument rating, but difficult for a pilot without one,” David Learmount, a former flight instructor, said in an email.","Shortly before the plane vanished from radar, Mr. Ibbotson requested and received permission from air traffic control to descend to 2,500 feet, possibly to go under the worst of the weather, or to avoid icing, which can cause a plane to crash.","Willie McKay, Mr. Sala’s agent has told the BBC that he was involved in selecting the plane or the pilot and that he did not own the plane that flew Mr. Sala. He said the flight was organized through a man named David Henderson, “who has flown us and many of our players all over Europe on countless occasions.”"
European Methods on an Argentine League Budget - The New York Times,"AVELLANEDA, Argentina — Partially obscured by a rusting rack of weights, the back wall of the gym at Racing Club’s youth academy has been painted dark blue and daubed with symbols.","On one side are four bright, color-coded dots; on the other, four numbered yellow circles. Rising from the floor are two miniature depictions of goal posts, no more than a foot wide; fixed at the top are two hooks, looped with string, a ball hanging from each.","Diego Huerta, an assistant at the academy and one of the club’s scouts, walks past with barely a glance, stopping only when he registers the confused looks. At Borussia Dortmund, he explains, the academy boasts a Footbonaut, a futuristic piece of training equipment designed to improve speed of thought and skill of execution. Standing inside a cage, Dortmund players receive a ball every few seconds. Simultaneously, a box on one of the four walls will light up. The player must swivel, fire the ball into the correct box, and then be ready to receive the next pass.","Dortmund is one of just two clubs in the world to have one; T.S.G. Hoffenheim is the other. Coaches believe that two or three minutes inside the Footbonaut can have the same impact as multiple training sessions, but it does not come cheap: Each machine costs from $2 million to $4 million, and requires updates to the software that runs it.","That price tag is way beyond Racing’s means. It is working with a local software developer on a pared-down, budget-friendly equivalent, but in the meantime, its answer, adapted for the realities and restrictions of the game in Argentina, includes the dots and circles painted on the weight room walls, the soccer balls hanging from strings. “This,” Huerta said, “is our version.”","The same ethos is struck through everything Racing does. Like all of Argentina’s traditional powerhouses, this is a club conscious of its history. The walls of the cafe at the academy are lined with images of former stars; half of the room is given over to an extensive timeline of the club’s achievements, from the swath of championships it claimed in the early part of the 20th century to its first Copa Libertadores success, in 1967.","That year, it became the first Argentine team to win the Intercontinental Cup, beating the European champion, Glasgow Celtic, over two bad-tempered legs. It has styled itself “el primer grande” — the first of Argentina’s great clubs — ever since.","Unusually, though, Racing is not beholden to that history, or content to be swaddled by its traditions. Argentina’s biggest clubs are run as social institutions, in which members vote for presidents every few years. The system is cherished as a bulwark against corporate creep, a way of ensuring that clubs’ identities are not leveraged to the highest bidder, but it can make them cumbersome and conservative, structurally resistant to change.","In that context, Racing stands out as a bastion of innovation. It is not just the homemade Footbonaut. It is the support available to the 55 boys who live at the club’s academy, far in advance of what most of their peers in Argentina would be offered, ranging from social workers and psychologists to academic tutors. It is the approach to player development, centering less on results and more on individual progress. Most of all, it is the work done in a small, subterranean office in the parking lot of the club’s stadium.","Here, Javier Weiner’s team of four scouts, including Huerta, sits at a bank of four desks, each one dominated by an iMac. The scouts scour games from Argentina’s lower leagues and a handful of South American countries on Wyscout, a content platform that streams action from across the world.",Each scout has an area to cover: Weiner takes Argentina and Colombia; Huerta monitors youth soccer and Venezuela.,"Using the analytics service InStat, they compile dossiers on potential acquisitions, drawing together not just raw performance data but also players’ psychological, emotional and medical backgrounds. They track information from journalists on social media.","Most clubs of this scale in Europe, North America and Asia would see this work as standard now; in Argentina, it is all but revolutionary. “Most of the time, it is the head coach who recruits players, or the president, with the help of a few agents,” Huerta said. “There is no process: Everything changes constantly. And there are times when crucial decisions are made by someone who does not know anything about football.”","Racing, however, is determined to be “another type of club,” Weiner said. “We have to be creative,” he said. “We have to have a network that means we can get players before bigger clubs because financially we cannot compete with River Plate and Boca Juniors.”","The mastermind behind that plan for the future is one of the towering figures from Racing’s past. His image hangs from not one poster, but two, in the hall at the academy.","Diego Milito won two Argentine titles with Racing as a player, though most of his success came in Italy, where he was the attacking spearhead of José Mourinho’s treble-winning Inter Milan team. He returned to his boyhood team to see out his career in 2014. After retiring, in 2016, he was appointed Racing’s technical secretary, an equivalent to a director of football role.","Milito’s goal, Huerta said, was to “make Racing a champion again.” He is on the cusp of doing just that: Racing sits atop Argentina’s Superleague, a first title since 2014 inching ever closer. Its journey, though, directed by Milito, has been unorthodox.","“All the time Milito was in Europe, he saw how they were working, and he tried to adapt some of the ideas he found,” Huerta said. ","Scouting was central to that. One of Milito’s first appointments was Weiner, who had been working with his father, Gabriel, on his “mobile technical unit”: a freelance scouting operation, effectively, that carried out project work for European and North American clubs. “We had been commissioned by Bayer Leverkusen, Udinese, Chicago Fire and a few others,” Javier Weiner said. A Racing fan, he leapt at the chance to sign up permanently when Milito asked. ","Huerta’s route was a little different. A journalist by training, he spent four years working at Clarín, Argentina’s biggest news outlet, before starting to work with Martí Perarnau, once an Olympian for Spain and now a prolific journalist, author and the biographer of Pep Guardiola.","Huerta’s connection with Perarnau allowed him to visit several of Europe’s most progressive clubs. “I talked to people from Dortmund, Sevilla, Barcelona, Olympique Marseille,” he said. “I went to watch Zinedine Zidane while he was coaching Real Madrid’s reserve team. I had read ‘Soccernomics’ and ‘Moneyball.’ I had some ideas on how to run a club.”","He started doing video analysis and statistics work for Racing. When Milito arrived, he spotted Huerta’s gift for languages and recruited him into his inner circle. He now acts as a bridge between the scouting operation, the first team and the academy. “We did not have a structure before,” Huerta said. “Now we have a clear vision of what we want the club to be.”","The best parallel he can find is with one of those clubs he visited on his tour of Europe: Sevilla, a team that has built sustained modern success among much bigger rivals by recruiting well and selling better.","Racing has always had a reputation for youth development — the club is known, in Argentina, as La Academia — and that remains central to Milito’s plan. In his office at the academy, Huerta keeps a map of all the areas of Argentina where he has searched for talent.","There has never been any shortage of that, of course — “Switzerland knows how to make watches, and we make players,” the grizzled academy director Miguel Gomis said — but there is a belief, too, that it can be done more effectively, more reliably.","“We do not see the mistakes we make because no matter how badly we do things, players come through,” Gomis said.","There is a focus, now, not on “training talent” — the endless slew of creative, attacking players that Argentina is famous for — but on “positions of concept,” the more defensive, more cerebral roles. “We want to create the players that Racing needs,” said Claudio Úbeda, a coach at the academy. “But also the players that Europe wants.”","Racing is looking further afield than any of its rivals for that raw material. It is, Huerta said, often the only Argentine team that sends scouts to international youth tournaments. It has started to recruit players from Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.","Just as significant, it has “formalized,” as Weiner put it, the other end of the process. “I remember seeing a couple of tall, blond guys in the crowd at one game,” Weiner said. “It turned out they were scouts from F.C. Copenhagen, in Denmark. There was nobody to help them get tickets to watch a player, so they just ended up behind the goal. We have changed that now.”","So new that there remains some suspicion about it. The concept of scouting remains alien to some. Huerta is regularly asked by colleagues from other teams why he is bothering to watch lower tier games or follow players from Venezuela. There are skeptics within the club, too; Milito’s revolution has not been entirely peaceful. Change does not come easily, even with such a potent figurehead. The team he has built, though, has the courage of its convictions. Racing can see the future; or its own, homemade version of it, at least."
How a Global Reputation Is Changing an Amateur Derby - The New York Times,"BUNSCHOTEN-SPAKENBURG, the Netherlands — Every seat, every perch, every conceivable inch of space is occupied. The two grandstands that run alongside the field at the Sportpark de Westmaat are full. The extra bleachers that have been put up for the occasion, no more than scaffold and gangplanks, are full.","Fans hang over railings and cram into corners, standing four or five deep, straining on their toes to get a decent view. Once all the feasible vantage points are gone, one or two decide that there is no other option than to head for the roof. It feels as if everyone in this sleepy seaside village, an hour or so southeast of Amsterdam, has turned out for the occasion, and several more besides.","Ronald Koeman, the coach of the Dutch national team, is here; so is Aad de Mos, the veteran former coach of Ajax. Fans, less illustrious, have traveled the length and breadth of the country to be here.","It is not normally like this. IJsselmeervogels — the team that calls the Sportpark home — ordinarily attracts crowds of around 1,500, or maybe 2,000 for a big game, according to Theo Muijs, the club secretary. Its games are shown only on regional television. It competes, after all, in the Tweede Divisie, Dutch soccer’s semiprofessional third tier.","Today, though, is an 8,000-capacity sellout, and there are reporters and camera crews from Fox Sports posted around the field, too. For those who could not get a ticket, the game is being broadcast live on national television. Not bad for a third-division game in a village of scarcely more than 20,000 people. “We will make as much money from today as we will from the rest of the season,” Muijs said.","The reason for that is simple: The visitor today is S.V. Spakenburg, a rival so local that the two clubs’ stadiums are all but contiguous. (They are both called the Sportpark de Westmaat, and share a parking lot; when the teams meet, Spakenburg’s players walk from their own home ground to the changing rooms at IJsselmeervogels.)","This game is widely regarded as the “biggest amateur derby in Holland,” said Rob Commandeur, a fan who has made the trip from Heinkenszand, not far from the Belgian border, just to see it. Given the scale of the crowd, and the interest, there is a compelling case to be made that description undersells it a little.","A Copa90 documentary in 2016 labeled IJsselmeervogels-Spakenburg the “world’s biggest amateur derby (probably).” In the village, they regard this game as fiercer than even Ajax and Feyenoord, the country’s most famous rivalry. “It is the derby of derbies,” Jan de Jong, an IJsselmeervogels fan, said.","Spakenburg, a few hours before the game, does not quite give that impression. It is market day: Alongside the canal, stalls selling vast arrays of cheese and cold cuts do a steady trade. At the marina, beneath a forest of wooden masts, a couple of craftsmen whittle and plane away at their boat. Young men, wrapped up against the bitter cold, dangle fishing lines into the water.","Aside from the occasional flash of color — a red IJsselmeervogels scarf, a hat adorned with Spakenburg’s blue badge — most residents keep their affiliations hidden underneath thick jackets. One or two silken flags have been draped from balconies. Down the side streets, where each house boasts not just a number but a small plaque denoting the name of the family who call it home, a few more flutter from doorways. Often, red and blue sit side by side, in those places where loyalties are split.","There is a reason for the peace. Bars in Spakenburg are forbidden from selling alcohol until 5 p.m. on derby day, the legacy of sporadic outbreaks of violence in years gone by. Some suggest the problems were related to hooligans from professional teams — Ajax and ADO Den Haag, in particular — who used the game as an excuse to settle their own scores; others look a little closer to home.","Regardless, the effect of the alcohol ban has been pronounced. Rather than thronging the town, fans now tend to gather at house parties instead. “We started at 11,” de Jong said. “We ate fish. Also there was beer.” He is swaying, just a little, as he says it.","Occasional bursts of boisterous chanting echo around the streets, though the big celebration — an official fan party thrown by IJsselmeervogels fans — was held on an industrial estate a 40-minute walk away. That, too, you sense, is deliberate: A brisk walk in freezing temperatures has a conveniently sobering effect.","It is as kickoff approaches that the fans appear: dozens at first, then hundreds, a great tide walking toward the Sportpark, so many that it seems impossible that the village seemed empty just a few minutes earlier. Slowly, the stadium begins to fill. Finally, the show starts.","Those who grew up with the game have always regarded it as special. “You do not have a choice: You are either red or blue, from birth,” said Joran van Dierman, a red, here with his wife, Maureen, a blue. “Everyone remembers the first time they came to a derby.”","In recent years, though, the game’s reputation has grown, particularly among a certain type of soccer fan. It has become a destination game, a kind of hipster bucket-list item for anyone seeking a jolt of authenticity, something untainted by the sanitized, prepackaged corporate glamour of the world’s elite leagues. “It is quite a cool mix,” said Commandeur, here with a clutch of his teammates from their hometown club. “It is an amateur game, but with a more professional vibe.”","In the Netherlands, it is now what puts Spakenburg on the map. “I travel a lot for work, to Amsterdam, to Utrecht,” van Dierman said. “When people ask you where you are from, the first thing they say is: ‘Oh, Spakenburg. Are you a red, or are you a blue?’”","That fame, though, has spread well beyond the Dutch border. “We have had requests from fans from Belgium, Germany, Austria, everywhere,” said Henk van de Groep, IJsselmeervogels’s communications manager.","Muijs, too, has been inundated with requests. “There have been a lot of things on social media,” he said. “A few years ago, there was a list of the top 20 derbies in the world. Boca Juniors against River Plate was first. We were 19th. It’s not even a professional game!”","The game’s appeal is not the standard of play, but the theater that surrounds it. “It is a strong rivalry, but in a good way,” said Reinie van de Groep (no relation to Henk); she grew up here, but regards herself as a “purple.” “It is very humorous, very creative,” she said.","Fans of both clubs have, in the past, staged eye-catching stunts before the game. IJsselmeervogels fans released a live pig on Spakenburg’s field, a nod to their rivals’ reputation as the farmers’ team; Spakenburg responded by hiring a plane to release hundreds of inflatable toilet brushes over enemy territory. There have been banners depicting warlike Smurfs, and enormous, inflatable Vikings.","This edition’s efforts center on “La Casa de Papel,” a Spanish Netflix series about a heist at the Royal Mint in Madrid. Before the game, the home fans unveil a huge mural depicting several of their players in the show’s red hoodies, above the slogan “La Casa de los Pájaros”: the Bird Cage. On the field, six men, their faces concealed by Guy Fawkes masks — another nod to the series — fire toy machine guns into the air. Fans are handed masks as they enter. Even the away section, clad in blue, has them, though nobody can quite explain the significance of the reference.","There are streamers and glitter cannons and air dancers. The game kicks off 10 minutes late, in fact, because the display was so lavish that nobody seemed to have taken into account that all of the paraphernalia would have to be removed from the field. For much of the first half, players on one flank have to dodge not only opponents but the bright red streamers left littering the halfway line, too.","The game, almost inevitably, feels something of an afterthought. IJsselmeervogels — historically the more successful of the two teams, and chasing a championship again this season — takes the lead. Spakenburg equalizes a few minutes later. Early in the second half, the host is reduced to 10 men, its midfielder Maikel de Harder sent off for lashing out at a Spakenburg player. It peters out into a feisty, full-blooded tie.","By the end, the noise has abated a little. Fans start to filter out, clutching their masks as mementos. Perhaps the result has left everybody dissatisfied. Perhaps thoughts are drifting, now, to the lifting of the alcohol ban at 5 p.m.","A few fans confide that this has been a more low-key affair than they had been expecting, that the previous encounter this season — also a tie — was a little more colorful, a little more of an occasion. They wonder if the novelty has worn off, or if the reputation now weighs too heavily, if the expectations are impossible to match.","A few minutes after the game, the road out of Spakenburg is choked with traffic. Those who came from much further afield to watch the derby of derbies are starting to leave. They have had their weekend road trip, seen the world’s biggest amateur derby, ticked another item off the bucket list, devoured another experience. The locals walk home, to the houses with their names etched outside and the flags hanging from balconies, to clear up the detritus of the parties they hosted. Spakenburg will be quiet again soon, the same as ever. The game that defines it, though, is changing, an occasion that used to be exclusively local irrevocably altered, somehow, by its contact with the global."
Israeli Becomes World's Oldest Player - The New York Times,"OR YEHUDA, Israel — Darting between the goal posts with his striking white hair, 73-year-old Israeli Isaak Hayik set a new world record on Friday as the oldest person to play in a professional soccer match.

The Fleeting Magic of the F.A. Cup - The New York Times,"ACCRINGTON, England — Andy Holt is standing at the door to the bar, watching the celebrations unfold. On the field, Accrington Stanley’s players are in the middle of an impromptu lap of honor, pumping their fists and beaming broad smiles. John Coleman, their manager, is conducting the crowd’s chanting, soaking in their adulation.","Holt, the club’s owner, does not seek to join them, to bask in their reflected glory. But still, as fans start to leave, a steady stream heads toward him, hands outstretched, wanting to offer their congratulations, or share their glee.","He greets each one like an old friend. “You should come in here, it’s only a pound a pint,” he tells one. Another is reassured that the prize money for the victory will be reinvested in the team. “That’s £135,000, that is,” he says. “It’ll go straight into the squad.”","On one level, that is what the F.A. Cup means to a club like Accrington Stanley, and to a chairman like Holt. Though Coleman’s team is now thriving in League One — English soccer’s third tier — it is doing so on a fourth-tier budget. By beating Ipswich Town, which competes a division higher, in the third round of the world’s oldest cup competition, Accrington has earned around a tenth of its annual revenue in a single day.","For Holt, the bigger thrill, though, is what may be to come. Should Accrington be drawn to face one of the Premier League’s giants in the next round — Holt had hoped for Manchester United or Arsenal, though Monday night’s draw would later pair those two titans together — and should the game be selected for television, the rewards could approach £1 million: life-changing, season-defining, horizon-expanding money. ","“There are not many chances for a club like us to get access to football’s fortunes,” Holt said. “The F.A. Cup is one of them. You could do a lot with a million pounds, around Accrington.”","Accrington was not the only club imagining those possibilities over the last four days. That has always been the charm of the F.A. Cup’s third-round weekend, traditionally the most romantic in England’s soccer calendar. This is the point when the teams from the country’s top two divisions, the Premier League and the second-tier Championship, enter the competition, alongside those from the lower tiers and any nonleague clubs that have survived an arduous campaign through the early rounds.","That sense of opportunity has long made it fertile ground for surprises. It is in the F.A. Cup’s third round that the lesser lights have the chance to bloody the noses of the great and the good, when the coddled elite come unstuck in airless, ramshackle stadiums and on haphazard, mud-ridden fields.","When they do, their conquerors gain a form of immortality: Hereford beating Newcastle in 1972; Sutton United overcoming Coventry in 1989; Wrexham’s win against Arsenal in 1992 — all of them now granted a place in the pantheon of giant-slayers, otherwise unremarkable names remembered in folklore by successive generations. If there is magic in the Cup, the spell is cast by third-round weekend.","This year — as ever — a handful of teams maintained the tradition: Oldham, Newport County and Gillingham beat Premier League opposition. Barnet, of the fifth-tier Conference, overcame Sheffield United, a team in contention for promotion to the Premier League next season.","By those standards, Accrington’s win barely counted as a shock: Ipswich Town is currently last in the Championship, enduring a miserable season. ","“It will be F.A. Cup magic if we manage to win,” said Mark Pinkney, an Ipswich fan who had made the journey to Accrington with his father, Harold, and son, James. ",The three generations had come to the low hills of Lancashire from England’s southeast coast because they hoped the Cup might provide a little “break” from the league.,"That, to many, is precisely the problem. For all that third-round weekend means in the hearts of many English soccer fans, for all the memories it conjures, it is now taken as a truism that it has lost some of its mystique, some of its appeal.","Some fans, like Nick Mills, 43, a Grimsby Town supporter on his way to his team’s meeting with Crystal Palace of the Premier League, blame those teams who prioritize survival in the top flight over a shot at glory.","“Teams like Palace and Newcastle: they’re the ones that have killed it, the teams where it is about Premier League survival,” he said. “Knocking Palace out would be an upset, but you’re expecting a reserve team.”","Though the upsets still come, Mills is correct: those Premier League teams eliminated this year, as is now generally the case, were lacking most — if not all — of their first-choice players, many of them rested for what the club decided were more important games. Palace made it through, narrowly, in front of 6,000 traveling Grimsby fans, but it did so having made nine changes from its last Premier League game.","Others cast the blame on the Football Association itself: for kick-starting the competition’s demise by allowing Manchester United to opt out in 2000, in favor of playing in that year’s Club World Cup in Brazil; for toying with various ideas — like abolishing replays of tied matches — to bow to the wishes of those Premier League clubs that see the Cup as an unwelcome distraction. This year, the F.A. was fiercely criticized for scheduling games at seemingly random times across the weekend to meet the demands of an international television deal, and using other matches as test runs for a video assistant referee system. ","“It’s a wonderful thing, the F.A. Cup,” Holt said. “It needs protecting.”","Wherever the fault, the effects are obvious. At Burnley’s meeting with Barnsley, the Premier League hosts had tried to encourage more fans to come by reducing ticket prices to £10 for adults and £5 for children. Though the visiting team had brought a healthy contingent, Turf Moor, Burnley’s raucous stadium, was noticeably quieter than normal. Swaths of seats remained empty.","Elsewhere, there were weakened teams named not only by the Premier League’s giants and those battling to avoid relegation from the top flight, but by those, like Leicester City, caught in the middle, and with nothing much else to play for. The trend is now mainstream: Championship teams often name weakened sides, too; the prize money on offer even for winning the F.A. Cup pales in comparison to the king’s ransom promotion to the Premier League would bring.","Looked at from a distance, it is hard to see much magic left: teams of reserves contesting games they do not care about in front of half-empty stadiums, for the right to stay in a competition everyone involved sees as an afterthought.","From close-up — at Burnley, at Accrington, at Crystal Palace — over the course of three games in eight hours on third-round Saturday, though, the picture changes. The Cup may not mean what it did; its halcyon days may be gone. But it still matters to some of those involved.","Not just to the teams trying to win it, as proved by the sight of Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, rendered apoplectic by V.A.R.’s overturning a penalty given to his team just as his striker, Matej Vydra, started his run-up to take it.","But to the fans, too. “You’ll see a lot of kids today,” said Steve Wilkin, a program vendor sneaking glances at Grimsby-Palace at Selhurst Park. “Most of the ones you’ll see won’t be here at Premier League games.” ","Cup tickets are cheaper, more accessible; as at Burnley, the demographic inside Selhurst Park on Saturday skewed younger than the economics of English soccer ordinarily allow.","For the Pinkney family and the rest of the 1,200 or so Ipswich fans who had made the 500-mile round trip to Accrington, north of Manchester, it was a chance to touch new territory. ","“We’ve never played them before, ever,” Mark Pinkney said. “There’ll be a lot of people here today who want to tick the stadium off the list.”","The F.A. Cup may not have the prestige it once did; the annual discussion of how much better the Cup used to be may now be as much of a fixture of third-round weekend as the shocks and surprises. But it still provides opportunities: to visit new places, to see new teams, to welcome in new fans. It is still a place of possibilities.","“It’s still a thrill for us,” said Holt, back in Accrington. ","Holt will have a little longer to cherish that feeling. Accrington will face the winner of a replay between the Southampton and Derby County in the fourth round. It is not quite the money-spinner he had hoped for, but there is more to the F.A. Cup than economics. There are memories to be made.",Tariq Panja reported from London.
Arjen Robben Has Been Cutting Left His Entire Career. So Why Can’t Anyone Stop Him? - The New York Times,"DORTMUND, Germany — All told, Marcel Schmelzer must have spent hours scouring the video, searching for some sort of tell, some kind of clue.","Schmelzer, Borussia Dortmund’s long-serving left back, has performed the ritual 16 times over the last decade, building up an unparalleled expertise in the field. He has pored over countless clips. He was hoping to find something, anything that would give him a little advance warning, a bit of a head start.","“I tried to find a pattern,” he said. Thus far, though, he has drawn a blank. Even after all these years, even after all those hours of study, even after all those games, the defender who knows Arjen Robben better than anyone else still cannot work out when, exactly, he is going to cut inside.","From the outside, it can seem that there are few more predictable players in world soccer than Robben. He has performed his calling card so often since he first joined Bayern Munich 10 years ago that it now bears his name — not just in Germany, but also in France, where the act of cutting in from the right wing to shoot with the left foot is known as Le Robben. The player acknowledged last month that he was proud to have his “own move.”","What is most remarkable, though, is that his go-to maneuver has lost none of its power; the only surprise, now, is that he appears to retain his capacity to surprise.","Robben is, after all, deep into what will be his final season in Munich. He may make his final appearance in the Champions League for the club this week, should Bayern prove unable to get past Liverpool in a delicately poised last 16 tie on Wednesday at Munich’s Allianz Arena.","His time in Germany has been impressively successful: He has won six straight Bundesliga titles and a slew of domestic cups, and he scored the winning goal in the 2013 Champions League final. But it has also been admirably long. Robben is 35. It is 15 years since José Mourinho first signed him for Chelsea; 12 since he joined Real Madrid. ","He remains, though, an integral part of one of soccer’s great powers, a winger of genuine menace, silken touch and searing speed. If Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are this era’s leading men, then Robben is among the most prominent members of the supporting cast: instantly recognizable, a fixture on the game’s most exalted stage, his signature move a regular feature of the latter rounds of the Champions League.","It is so familiar that it barely needs description. Robben sprints up the right wing, one arm outstretched for balance, head pulled back, legs whirring. Then, as he approaches the penalty area, he feints to his right and drops his shoulder, only to shift his weight and slip off to the left. The ball never leaves his control; his opponent is left grasping at shadows.","Robben glances up, and curls a shot across the goalkeeper. It does not always go in, of course, but it does so frequently enough that Schmelzer is not the only one to have spent considerable time trying to work out how to stop it.","Here, though, comes the puzzle. Robben has been cutting left for years. His intent is apparent to all. Defenders know exactly what is in his mind, precisely what is coming, and yet remain powerless to stop it.","To Robben, two factors explain his continued success. Timing, he said in an interview with a handful of British newspapers last month, is one key: “If you do it at the right time, it still surprises them.” Variation, he has previously suggested, is equally important. “Doing the same thing over and over again without variation will not work,” he said. “If you never pass or dribble or go on the outside, cutting inside will stop working.”","To Schmelzer — who has had to deal with Robben in direct, face-to-face competition more than any other opponent — there is something else, however. He has noticed that Robben has leaned more heavily on his favored move in recent years, using the wing as a decoy to “open the path to the center.” It still works, though, because he “recognizes it when you block his path, and then he reacts accordingly; that is what makes him special.”","It is that ability to improvise that Ricardo Rodriguez identified, too. Rodriguez, a Swiss defender now with A.C. Milan, knows Robben almost as well as Schmelzer. According to Gracenote Sports, he has faced him 11 times during his career, in his time with Wolfsburg and F.C. Zurich.","“He is very fast, especially with the ball,” Rodriguez said. “That makes it very difficult to stop him. He is terribly fast when he cuts inside. The only way to try to stop him is to stay very close to him. If you don’t, he can hurt you any time.”","There is a reason for that. In 2010, a cognitive scientist named Shanti Ganesh, based at Radboud University in the Netherlands, conducted a study into Robben’s movement. She determined that Robben moves “a little faster than conscious knowledge.” A defender’s brain, Ganesh said, unconsciously follows Robben’s feints, even if it knows, deep down, that they are only feints. In the time it takes to rectify the error, Robben — as he was always going to, as everyone involved knew he was going to — has cut inside and taken a shot. “The player can still correct himself,” Ganesh said. “But that will always be a fraction too late.” ","It is a theory that chimes with the empirical study conducted by Wendell, a Brazilian left back at Bayer Leverkusen. He has faced Robben 10 times since moving to Germany, behind only Schmelzer and Rodriguez.","“Normally, it is the same move, but it is also the move we are tired of seeing, running after, and not getting the ball,” he said. “There must be something he does. Maybe he waits for the last moment, I don’t know. Most of the time, I try to wait for his move, so I have a bigger chance of getting the ball back. If I don’t take my time, I have no chance. He’ll dribble past me.”","Like Schmelzer, Wendell has spent more time than he might like watching clips of Robben. Like Schmelzer, he remembers training sessions in the days leading up to games against Bayern in which the team worked on how to defend him: His danger is such that it can only be dealt with collectively. ","Dortmund always had the same approach. “You need your teammates to back you up,” Schmelzer said. “We have to be honest: It is simply not possible to take him out of the match for the full 90 minutes. Jürgen Klopp always taught us that the problem is not losing a duel, but not covering it.”","When Schmelzer decided to go in for a tackle, he relied on his central defender, Mats Hummels, and his defensive midfielder, Sven Bender, to scurry across in support. It was not always enough: Robben, too, was not acting alone; he could always call on the threat of Philipp Lahm or, later, Joshua Kimmich streaking up the right wing to collect the ball on the overlap. Schmelzer had to be conscious of that, too.","Working out when to use the cut inside, and when it was merely a decoy, was always the challenge. Even after all these years, his opponents cannot tell when the move is coming. They have seen it before, and yet somehow every time feels like the first time. They can study the tapes, they can stay close, they can call for backup.","If none of that works, Wendell said, there is one last resort: “I try to get the ball back,” he said. “If I don’t, then I have to commit a foul.” It is when that fails — as it so often has — when he skips away too quickly, when he disappears in a flash, that Arjen Robben does what he has been doing for 15 years, does what he always does, and cuts inside."
"David Silva, Manchester City’s Key Piece, Is Now More Valuable Than Ever - The New York Times","MANCHESTER, England — A few weeks ago, before Manchester City’s serene season hit unexpected turbulence, David Silva ran into the parents of the club’s bright midfield hope, Phil Foden, after yet another routine Premier League win.","Silva is, both in private and in public, a quiet soul. He does not court the limelight — he consents to only one regular interview opportunity a year, a brief chat to promote tourism on the Canary Islands, where he grew up, in which he does his best to say nothing — or especially enjoy being the center of attention.","With Foden’s mother, Claire, though, he was effusive. He told her what a pleasure it was to train alongside her teenage son, and enthused at the prospect of just how good a player he thought Foden could become.","Less than a year after Foden had made his debut for City, Silva said he was already convinced that the 18-year-old had the potential to go on to be one of the best players in the world. His only hope, he told her, was that she might ask her son to “wait a couple of years” before blossoming. “Just to give me a chance,” he said.","There is a timeless quality to Silva. He turns 33 next week, but still seems the player he was when he first arrived in Manchester almost nine years ago. He is no less sharp, no less lively, no less fluent: “always in motion,” as his one time Spain teammate, Javi Martinez, once said. He still wears his brilliance lightly. He still sees no need to indulge in ornament or ostentation. His is a genius for simple things, done to perfection.","To his coach, Pep Guardiola, Silva is a “joy” to work with; to his teammates, as Kyle Walker put it, he is an “example.” He has been a central figure at City ever since he arrived in 2010, but if anything he is even more integral now, charged with knitting together all of the complex passing patterns Guardiola has drummed into his players.","It is no surprise that it was in his absence — as well as that of Fernandinho, another of City’s old stagers — because of a leg injury that City lost to Crystal Palace and Leicester City, offering Liverpool daylight at the summit of the Premier League, and turning the two teams’ meeting at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday into a game Silva and his teammates must win. “If we drop points, it’s over, almost impossible,” Guardiola said this week.","Even City, with all its resources, lacks something in Silva’s absence. “He is one of the most incredible players in the world at playing in the pockets,” Guardiola said of his playmaker earlier this season. “He is maybe the strongest in the world in those spaces. We try to attack those spaces: he is a master of it. Few players can do it.”","Silva’s talent is not his only source of influence: around the same time he was greeting Foden’s mother, Silva presented each of his teammates with a personalized Nintendo Switch console, inscribed with their initials, and two games. Silva is not much of a gamer himself, but he knew many of the younger players are; he felt the chance to play alongside and against each other might help the team bond on away trips.","The gesture was not advertised or announced to the team: the gifts came as a surprise. Silva made it as he plays a pass: with delicacy and discretion, not for its own sake but toward a greater goal.","Those are the traits on which he has built his career, that have led him to a World Cup title, two European Championships and three Premier League titles. But they are the characteristics, too, that may stop him from receiving the individual recognition he perhaps deserves.","Roberto Mancini, one of Guardiola’s predecessors at City and the manager who brought Silva to England from Valencia in 2010, always regarded his playmaker as the equal of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. “If he had gone to Barcelona” in 2008, Mancini said, “everyone would be saying he is one of the best players in the world.”","Silva has rarely — if ever — been mentioned in that conversation, even in dispatches. Indeed, remarkably, in nine years in England he has only once — back in September 2011 — managed to be voted the Premier League’s player of the month. He has won that award as often as such luminaries as Nikica Jelavic, Adam Le Fondre and Connor Wickham. He has, needless to say, never been voted the country’s player of the year.","And yet there is a case to be made that Silva ranks not just among the finest players of this Premier League generation, but among the greatest-ever imports into English soccer.","True, he cannot match the transformative effect Eric Cantona had on the game when he arrived — first at Leeds United, in 1992, and then at Manchester United — and true, he has not scored as frequently or played as explosively as the likes of Thierry Henry or Didier Drogba.","He may not be as decorated as Peter Schmeichel — who picked up five Premier League titles at Manchester United — or produced as many moments of jaw-dropping wonder as Dennis Bergkamp. Unlike Cristiano Ronaldo, he has not led his team to the Champions League crown, or gone on to score more goals in that competition than anyone else.","There are other ways, though, to gauge greatness. Never mind that Silva has won more Premier League titles than Henry, and as many as Ronaldo and Patrick Vieira.","Much more significant is the fact that, over the last decade, nobody has created more goals in the Premier League than the elfin Spaniard; only two foreign players — Bergkamp and Cesc Fàbregas — have more assists in English history.","Never mind that he has lasted longer in the tumult of English soccer than almost any of his rival candidates (only Vieira remains ahead of him, for now). Far more important is that he has done so despite being adjudged, in some quarters, as too lightweight for the fray when he first arrived. Silva has — not uniquely, but more than most — changed the way the Premier League sees itself; he has played a role in ending the tyranny of the powerhouse. He has not just helped to define and refine the playing style with which City is now synonymous, but proved that small, technical players can thrive in England.","“You can see his quality from how long he has survived in the Premier League,” Guardiola said. “If you survive, it is because you are a better player. When he moves, it is clever, more intelligent. When you see things like he does, it is because you are more intelligent than the others.”","That he is so easily overlooked — when Alan Shearer nominated a player to enter that pantheon last year, he went for Silva’s teammate Sergio Agüero — is in part because of the person Silva is: shy, private, not given to grand public declarations of his genius.",But it is also because of the player he is. Silva does not pretend to be a great soloist; he does not play to the gallery or for his personal highlights reel. He is not especially quick or frighteningly strong or ruthlessly productive.,"He is, instead, an embodiment of that old Guardiola maxim: He takes the ball; he passes the ball. The better he plays, the brighter others shine. It has been easy to lose sight of him, a player who seeks nothing but to be a part of the collective, but he has always been at the heart of it.","It is hard to tell, but he is slowly descending from the peak he has occupied for almost a decade. Even he thinks he has just a couple of years left before he is replaced. He may be right: Foden may go on to be one of the best in the world. Silva, though, will prove a tough act to follow."
