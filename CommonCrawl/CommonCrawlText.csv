They range from NBCSN to ESPN + to ‘ Sports Gold’ and PlayStation. I suggest you put the FA Cup Games on FoxSN and the Premier League on NBCSN. As to the Euro and Championship games, find a regular channel for them. I do not see why I have to pay to see games on my computer (small screen) when I outlay almost $200 a month for Comcast, Xfinity and Time Warner. Signed ‘old disgruntled City fan’ Rex Hearn.","Great comment. I pay a tons of money for the cable ($270/month) and I want to watch every soccer game in the TV. Whoever does not pay for cable lets pay for ESPN+ or NFL Gold, but do not force me to watch the games in my Apple watch, since I pay enough money to enjoy watching them in the TV. I am an Arsenal fan and I see all its game are now shown in the NBC gold.","Wow another crazy comment on here, so these different leagues and associations in different countries should all get together with the U.S. TV and streaming networks, forget out about who is paying more for rights and the networks should forget about their other programming and revenue and they should put it all on one channel and all lose money TO GROW THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!! and make WST commentors happy.","Also it’s 2019, you do know there are tons of ways to see streaming on a TV right??? You should get with the times.","+ + + Agree with Payasos! I would love to know who Rex Hearn and Vasil think they are addressing with their “suggestions” . . . the Grand Master of all soccer broadcasts worldwide???? Over-riding all franchise and broadcaster agreements? For the record I want all dramas and comedies from Amazon, Hulu and Netflix to be merged into one channel, because I don’t like paying three subscriptions. And all British shows from PBS, BritBox, and Acorn TV put onto BBC America, so that I don’t have to search for them and have them conveniently in one place. Oh, and all college basketball broadcasts cancelled, because I hate the game and it clutters up the menus on my TiVo",I totally agree with Rex . FIX IT !!!!,I’m sure they will get right on that for you!!!!!!!!!!!!,Are all Premier League teams playing on May 4th and May 12th? The 12th is Decision Day so that is a definite. But does the 2nd to last week also have all the teams playing in one day? Kind of like a Decision Day preview? Except all games are not on TV networks. Decision Day they are.,My cable shows Leicester v Burnley on Sat. 3/16 on NBCSN. Guess they are shuffling things with the FA Cup games?,"Hi Tom, NBCSN has moved things around so the Leicester-Burnley game will be on NBCSN.",Is there a reason why the first home game at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium isn’t being shown by NBCSN? Why show a game that is a nailed on home win (Man City) instead?,"Hello Doc, I agree with you 100% I’m sure there is going to be a beautiful opening ceremony at the new stadium. It’s also a London Derby. This is NBC Sports we’re talking about, remember. What in the world do they know about the EPL or professional football in general? Sky Sports News has been on NBCSN for a month now. I wonder if NBCSN learned anything from them?",Probably has more to do with it turning towards the end of the season and Manchester City and Liverpool are in a title race. I’d expect those two to be on TV whenever possible from here on out unless one of them builds a very sizable lead (doubtful).,It seems that they listened!

Please read the rules before joining the discussion.,A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.,Banners hang from The Joe’s rafters in testament to the franchise’s myriad stars and accomplishments.(Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News),"Detroit — They’re all taking a stroll down memory lane this week, what with the days numbered and down to a dwindling few.","The Red Wings can’t avoid taking a nostalgic turn on the ice now – their cherished playoff streak officially over after a remarkable quarter-century run – any more than Ken Holland can avoid this pivot, as he enters the hallway outside the team’s dressing room in Joe Louis Arena.","Fastened to the cinder block walls are a series of wooden plaques, along with framed team photos from every Red Wings season dating back to 1982, the year late owner Mike Ilitch purchased the moribund franchise. They go down one side and back the other, and for Holland, finishing his 20th season as the team’s general manager, they’re like pages from a high school yearbook put on display.","He has brushed past them countless times over the years, headed to the coaches’ office after games or to check on a player’s status after a morning skate. But just the other day, the 61-year-old Holland found himself lingering – and reminiscing.","Each plaque lists the roster – management, players and training staff – as well as the team’s record. And as Holland took stock, he tallied 14 out of 16 seasons – including an NHL-record 12 in a row from 1999 until 2012 – the Red Wings finished with 100 points or more.","“It’s amazing,” Holland said. “I probably wouldn’t have thought about it, but I was walking through here and I started looking at the plaques and you go year-by-year and ...”","And, well, look closely here and you’ll smile as you discover Steve Yzerman as a fresh-faced rookie in 1983-84. (He’s the one without a moustache in the photo.) Over there you’ll find Sergei Fedorov the year he won the Hart Trophy as league MVP in 1994. (Wait, is that Dino Ciccarelli sporting a black eye?) And down a bit further, there’s that 2002 team, one of the greatest ever assembled in the NHL, featuring nine future Hall of Famers, not including the head coach. (Or the owner. Or his top lieutenant.)",Nostalgic Sobotka ready for new home after The Joe,"On and on it goes, flanked on the opposite wall by a massive photo display of some of the Red Wings’ star players through the years. And when you finally get to the entrance to the dressing room, you’ll find the giant portraits that greet the current Red Wings each time they lace up their skates and head out to the ice surface. There’s Yzerman again, and Nicklas Lidstrom, along with Mike Vernon and Henrik Zetterberg – the four playoff MVPs from the four Stanley Cup champions that called the Joe home.","“Everywhere you look around here, you see the reminders,” said Dylan Larkin, who last season became the first Red Wings rookie since Yzerman in 1983-84 to earn All-Star honors. “All the great players, the championships they won.”","As he talks, he nods across the room at the black-and-white images lining the walls inside the Red Wings’ dressing room. Frans Nielsen sits in Yzerman’s old stall, and the Captain’s image looms overhead, alongside that of Igor Larionov, “The Professor” who centered the transcendent Russian Five. Petr Mrazek puts his pads on underneath Vernon’s photo, while the empty stall next to Jimmy Howard carries the nameplate of Terry Sawchuk. And so on.","Much of this was Jimmy Devellano’s idea when ownership decided it was time to do some remodeling years ago. Devellano, who was Ilitch’s first hire as GM – and the architect of the Red Wings’ revival, in many ways – made sure that history was displayed for all to see.","“The franchise was really built in the ’50s by that group of players – Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay and Alex Delvecchio and Terry Sawchuk,” Holland said. “But then it was rebuilt by these players at the highest level, winning championships and contending for championships here at the Joe.”","They aren’t contending for one this spring, which makes for an awkward goodbye this weekend at the Joe, this windowless hockey warehouse that opened for business in December 1979. Larkin is one of several current Red Wings who wasn’t even born the last time the franchise missed the playoffs – the third-longest streak in NHL history. And only a couple elder statesmen in the dressing room – Zetterberg and Niklas Kronwall – were alive when Ilitch bought the team for a relative pittance, back when the Red Wings were known as the “Dead Things” around town and the franchise “was in the Detroit River,” as Devellano puts it.","Things changed in a hurry, though, after Ilitch’s first draft pick arrived, and Jacques Demers was hired away from St. Louis, just in time to make Yzerman the youngest captain in team history and start making the Red Wings a hot ticket again in Detroit.","“Jacques taught us how to win,” Ilitch used to say, and once the winning started – they’d only made the postseason twice since 1966 – the entertainment never really stopped, from the “Bruise Brothers” and their Norris Division grudge matches to all the mind games Scotty Bowman played as he meddled with and melded a talented roster into a championship team.","Before long, they became a standard-bearer not just for the league, but in all of professional sports. No team did a better job of scouting and drafting than the Red Wings, particularly with their clandestine efforts in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. And no owner was more willing to spend money in pursuit of hockey’s Holy Grail.",Tomas Tatar scores Saturday in the Wings’ last tussle at The Joe with the longtime rival Toronto Maple Leafs. (Photo: Photos by David Guralnick / The Detroit News),"“We took risks but there was no salary cap and there were no limitations on payroll,” Holland said. “I think we all know you need stars. But Mr. Ilitch was prepared to pay for stars, and for the most part, we kept our stars and we added more.”","And more and more, before the NHL insisted on parity and the league instituted a salary cap to all but guarantee it. Of the two dozen members of the Hockey Hall of Fame who were a part of the Red Wings organization while the team played its games at the Joe, three of them were homegrown draft selections – Yzerman, Fedorov and Lidstrom. But that didn’t stop Ilitch from rubber-stamping deals for the likes of Chris Chelios and Dominik Hasek and Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull, even if it meant incurring the wrath of his wife, Marian, at times.","And it’s that juxtaposition that always stood out, right? Detroit as a destination, despite what the census said. “Hockeytown,” the Red Wings dubbed it, and the players were the celebrities. But thanks to their longevity and the fans’ proximity, the Joe was a lot like the bar from “Cheers,” as Chris Osgood explains it, “where everybody knows your name.”","Sure, that meant Stevie Y and Sergei, Vlady and Nick, Ozzie and Drapes, Pav and Z. But it also meant the food-service staff and the security guards and the parking lot attendants. And where else but here would the building manager become a star, too? Al Sobotka, who started at the Olympia and will make the move to new Little Ceasars Arena in the fall, didn’t just rile up the place with his playoff octopus twirls, he filled it up with smoke from his famous barbecues.","The Joe might’ve been short on amenities, but it had plenty of character to go with all those characters. There was the “Knitting Lady” and the “Orange Hat Guy,” but there was also the cramped stick room where players lounged after games and Dominik Hasek once spent the night after a frustrating loss before that ’02 title run. The visitors’ bench was too small, and the stairs were a drunken fan’s nightmare. The end boards were the last wooden ones in the league, and the out-of-town scoreboard never worked. They forgot to build a press box, and there was no room to move on the concourse.","“And in an age where athletes are walking through well-lit, red-carpeted back corridors to their dressing rooms,” Shanahan added, “our path was under the stands where there was a lot of spilled beer and spilled popcorn.""","But as it all comes spilling out now, this is what the fans will remember and what the Red Wings will try to take with them as they move into a new home, packing up those photos before they go.","“The charm in this building,” Holland said wistfully, “was the people in it.”"
,"FOXBORO, Mass. – Senior defenseman Matt Buckley (Canton, Mass.) scored the game-winning power-play goal at the 7:03 mark of the third period as the Saint Anselm College men's hockey team punched its ticket to the Northeast-10 Conference Championship tournament title game with a 3-1 win against Stonehill College Saturday afternoon at Foxboro Sports Center.","Saint Anselm erased an early 1-0 deficit by scoring the final three goals in Saturday's semifinal matchup that was physical from the start. Just 30 seconds into the game Saint Anselm was whistled for a boarding penalty that put the Skyhawks on an early power-play chance. The Hawks, who led the conference in penalty kill percentage this season, maintained that trait by shutting out Stonehill on its three power play opportunities on the afternoon.","Stonehill would open the scoring however at the 12:29 mark of the first period as NE-10 First Team honoree Robbie Dorgan one-timed a Richard Harris pass past Saint Anselm freshman goaltender Shane Joyce (Pembroke, Mass.) to snatch an early lead for the Skyhawks.","However, Saint Anselm continued to pressure the Stonehill defense, outshooting the hosts 17-8 in the first period and 14-9 in the second frame. Eventually the Hawks found a crack in Stonehill's NE-10 Goaltender of the Year Chris Tasiopoulos' armor with just over five minutes remaining in the second period. Freshman forward Easton Miller (Mission Viejo, Calif.) tied the game at 1-1 on a deep shot from the point off an assist from junior forward Bryan Sullivan (Burlington, Mass.).","With most of the momentum flowing into Saint Anselm's locker room into the second intermission, the Hawks continued to pressure the Skyhawks' zone before Buckley launched home another shot from the point that beat a screened-off Tasiopoulos for the would-be game-winner.","Stonehill nearly answered with a pair of Kevin Aufiero shots just a few minutes later, but his first attempt ricocheted off the post. Two minutes after that, Aufiero's one-timer was halted by a diving Joyce to preserve the 2-1 lead for Saint Anselm.","As the time ticked away and the intensity ratcheted up, play got a bit ugly down the stretch of the third period. Stonehill was whistled for three game misconduct penalties over the final 1:15 of the game, and Saint Anselm took advantage with an empty net power-play goal by Sullivan in the closing minute to seal a statement victory.","Joyce, an NE-10 Second Team nominee, picked up his 10th win of the year, improving to 10-9-3 overall and collecting 24 saves Saturday afternoon. Tasiopoulos recorded 40 saves while giving up two of the three goals scored.","The win improves Saint Anselm to 10-13-3 overall and avenges a 1-1 overtime tie with Stonehill in the teams' regular season matchup just over a week ago. The Skyhawks dropped their first game against an NE-10 opponent with the loss, finishing their season with a 14-6-4 overall record.",Saint Anselm will move on to the NE-10 Championship game for the 14th time in the 16 years the league has hosted the postseason tournament. The Hawks own the highest winning percentage of all teams in the conference with a 22-9 overall mark since the 2000 Championship series.,"The Hawks will play the winner of Saturday night's other semifinal game featuring host and top-seeded Saint Michael's College and #4-seed Assumption College in South Burlington, Vt. Should the Purple Knights prevail, they will welcome Saint Anselm for the Championship Final on Saturday, Feb. 28. If the underdog Greyhounds pull off the upset, the Hawks would host Assumption at Sullivan Arena next weekend.","Stay up-to-date with the latest news, including game previews and recaps, directly from the Saint Anselm College athletic department by liking us on Facebook and following us on Twitter @STAHawks."

Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez has been told to step up his game by Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller having failed to score a goal since October.,"Hernandez, 28, is set to reunite with the rest of the Leverkusen squad after the winter break when they land in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday afternoon.","Following an impressive return of 33 goals in his first 48 competitive appearances for the German side, the Mexico international has failed to find the back of the net in his previous 15 matches, last scoring in the 2-0 defeat of Borussia Dortmund on Oct. 1.","“Chicharito now needs to show more. He knows best that he needs to step up his game,” Voller told Bild.",Voller added that he believes insecurity over his girlfriend’s health amplified Hernandez’s problems on the pitch.,"He said: “It was a burden on him that his girlfriend wasn’t feeling too well, but we’ll definitely see a different Chicharito again.”","In recent weeks, there has been speculation that Leverkusen could allow the striker to move on if a club were to bid at least €30 million for a player who is under contract until 2018.","Voller does not expect a club to come forward, saying: “I can’t imagine it. We need a good and functioning Chicharito.”","Elsewhere, kicker reported on Tuesday that Robbie Kruse has not made the trip to Florida after his agent and Leverkusen agreed that the attacker can look at offers from China and Major League Soccer.",Kruse has only appeared in three matches for Leverkusen this term and is widely expected to leave Germany five-and-half years after joining Fortuna Dusseldorf from Melbourne Victory in the summer of 2011.,,"Live football scores .

"Posted by: mindoversports on: September 4, 2017","There’s an old Yiddish Proverb that says: Mit ein kinder compt mazel. When translated, means “With each (newborn) child, comes luck.” But is it luck or are there mysterious unexplained powers at work that actually create the good luck. I have found, after conducting experiential self-esteem building workshops for many years, there’s a strong correlation between high feelings of self-worth, when an individual’s life is in harmony, and that individual’s ability to create positive events in his or her life.","And the opposite is also true. When individuals have a low sense of self-worth, and their lives are not in harmony, they will actually create negative events in their lives.","A low sense of self-worth is brought about when we withhold our feelings, when we lie or tell half-truths, when we cheat others, and when we allow unresolved issues to hover above us like a dark cloud. A low sense of self-worth can also be a manifestation of not having been loved and nurtured as a child.",But we can break the chain and enhance our lives! It takes time and hard work; there’s no such thing as a quick fix. Here are two examples of how the process works:,"Professional women athletes who take a maternity break from their sport, have their baby, and then return to their sport, will almost always experience enhanced performance. One needs only to follow the LPGA, WNBA and female Track & Field athletes to see this power of the universe at work.","Here’s an example from a negative perspective: The untimely death of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn Bissette and her sister Lauren. Their lives were not working and there was anything but harmony in their relationship. Carolyn was allegedly having an affair and doing drugs. John was experiencing anguish and a state of confusion over his troubled marriage, his failing magazine, and the recent news that his best friend and cousin, Tony Radziwill, was near death with testicular cancer.","Good things will happen to you beginning the day you are born providing you come from a loving, nurturing family.

KSHSAA,—The Kansas State High School Activities Association serves students by providing leadership for the administration of education based interscholastic activities—,601 SW Commerce Place · Topeka · 785.273.5329 · jholaday@kshsaa.org,"May 3, 2018",FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE,To KSHSAA Approved Media:,"A growing concern in the high school community, an issue that is seldom discussed, is the increasing number of injuries caused when a teenage boy or girl participates in the same sport all year long. It’s called “sports specialization,” and oftentimes results in serious injury to muscles, joints, ligaments and bones.","It can ruin promising careers, cost families tens of thousands of dollars, and literally change lives.","As the enclosed op-ed piece points out, there is a solution that’s easy and inexpensive. Teenage athletes are encouraged to participate in multiple sports in high school instead of just one. And as many professionals would attest, it’s a process that can actually help them become more adept at their primary sport.","This is a story that needs to be told as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of young athletes in your community who are at risk because of intense year-round training programs their bodies are not mature enough to handle.",Many thanks for your interest and support.,"Sincerely,",Gary MusselmanKSHSAA Executive Director,OP-ED,THE INHERENT RISK OF SPORT SPECIALIZATION,"By Bob Gardner, Executive Director of the National Federation of State High School Associations and Gary Musselman, Executive Director of the Kansas State High School Activities Association.","One of the responsibilities that parents take most seriously is protecting their children from injury, whether it is buckling seat belts in a car or wearing a helmet while riding a bike. And when their kids become teenagers and want to participate in sports or other activities, parents do everything they can to keep their sons and daughters from getting hurt.","But not all injuries are caused by a twist, fall, collision or accident. Many are caused when young athletes repeat the same athletic activity so often that muscles, ligaments, tendons and bones don’t have time to recover—especially among middle school and high school students. These injuries can end promising careers, cost families tens of thousands of dollars, squash dreams and literally change lives.","Examples include elbow and arm injuries to teenagers who play baseball or softball all year long, shoulder injuries to year-round swimmers, wrist and elbow injuries to gymnasts, and stress fractures to soccer players.","The culprit, most often, is what’s commonly known as “sport specialization,” the process of playing the same sport all year long with the goal of either gaining a competitive edge or earning a college scholarship. It involves intense, year-round training in a single sport.","Research shows that sports specialization is putting teenage athletes at risk. According to a study commissioned by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) and conducted by researchers from the University of Wisconsin, high school athletes who specialize in a single sport are 70 percent more likely to suffer an injury during their playing season than those who play multiple sports.",The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says much the same. It reports that “overuse injuries” (injuries caused when an athletic activity is repeated so often that parts of the body do not have enough time to heal) are responsible for nearly half of all sports injuries to middle school and high school students.,There is a solution. Young athletes should be encouraged to play multiple sports.,"When student-athletes cross-train, they work different muscle groups and joints which, in fact, results in better overall conditioning. They also develop a new set of athletic skills like hand-eye coordination, balance, endurance, explosion and agility that are transferable to their primary sport. It’s no coincidence that 30 of the 32 first-round picks in the 2017 National Football League draft played multiple sports in high school.","Parents can play a key role in preventing these overuse injuries by encouraging their kids to play multiple sports rather than pushing them to specialize in one sport. They will have more fun, will be less likely to suffer burnout and will actually become better athletes. .",kshsaa.org,,https://www.facebook.com/sutv55
Arbor View football coach Dan Barnson went into Thursday’s game against rival Centennial worrying about how sharp his team would be in its opener.,Those worries quickly were eliminated.,The third-ranked Aggies forced four turnovers and scored two defensive touchdowns on the way to a 35-7 home win over the Bulldogs.,"“I’m proud of the kids,” Barnson said. “Holy smokes. They came out a ball of fire. What can you say?”",Three of those turnovers came in the first quarter as the Aggies sprinted to a 21-0 advantage.,"“It was huge,” said sophomore defensive end Bishop Jones, who had two sacks and forced a fumble. “The turnovers were a big momentum swing that I think got us the lead.”",The Aggies took control from the first play from scrimmage when fullback Ricky Clark took an inside handoff and went 73 yards to the Centennial 7.,"Two plays later, Andrew Cornwell scored on a quarterback sneak, and Zach Boyd hit the extra point for a 7-0 lead with 10:56 left in the first quarter.","From there, the Aggies flashed their dominance on defense. Cornerback Jacob Speaks intercepted a Kyle Carden pass on the next possession, which set up an eight-play, 60-yard scoring drive capped by a 1-yard run by Speaks.","After the teams traded fumbles, Centennial (0-2) had its best scoring chance of the night, driving to the Arbor View 3. But Carden bobbled the snap, which threw off the timing on his handoff to Lantz Worthington. Worthington never got control of the ball, and linebacker Lonnie Sharpe snatched the fumble out of the air and raced 93 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead with 6.9 seconds left in the first quarter.","“We put a big emphasis on getting the ball, scoring on defense, scoring on special teams,” Barnson said.","Herman Gray added a 9-yard touchdown run with 9:14 left in the half, and the Aggies led 28-0 at halftime.","In the third quarter, Jones put a big hit on Carden inside the Centennial 5, forcing a fumble. Defensive end Gage Motl pounced on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown and a 35-0 lead with 2:54 left in the third quarter.","“We had a blitz call,” Jones said. “My eyes got big, and I made the play.”",Arbor View limited Centennial to 36 yards of offense through three quarters before wearing down some in the fourth. Centennial finished with 134 yards.,"“We just executed what Coach (Mike) Brascia planned out for us,” Jones said. “He put it on paper, and we did it on the field.”","The Bulldogs finally scored with 1:10 to play when Coll Thomson hit Worthington with a 16-yard touchdown pass. The score was the first of the season for Centennial, which lost its opener 44-0 to JSerra Catholic (Calif.).","“We kind of showed that youngness in the second half,” Barnson said. “We still did well, but I’m looking forward to getting to that second one, because you usually make that big jump from Week 1 to Week 2.”","Gray led the Aggies with 117 yards rushing on 11 carries. Arbor View had 300 yards of offense, all on the ground.",Josh Gray paced Centennial with 69 yards rushing on 14 carries.,"“It’s real special,” Jones said of topping a rival in the opener. “We worked all summer, we worked hard, we trained every day.

Is this McLaren SLR Mercedes Sports Coupe Really White Gold? It Must be at US$ 2.5 Million,"Super luxury sport cars such as solid gold Mercedes sport coupes , gold plated Porche 997 GT-2 coupes; and especially a gold trimmed armored plated Rolls Royce are not what one might call environmentally friendly vehicles. Even if the white gold Mercedes does run on biofuel, its no more green than scores of super luxury cars tooling around desert highways in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other similar locales.",Front view of McLaren SlR white gold sports coupe,"It’s been common knowledge that many luxury cars wind up being abandoned on the side of desert roads; or simply left to gather dust in airport parking lots, like a recent JaguarXK8 sports model, and numerous BMW’s and Mercedes Benzes simply left there so their owners do not have to pay the parking fees.",Luxury Jag XK8 and other models abandoned at Abu Dhabi airport -The Daily Mail,"When the original article about the gold Mercedes V10 Quad Turbo came out a couple of years back, much speculation arose as to whether this car actually had a body made of white gold or was simply gold plated or even painted. It now appears, however, that according to a specialty auto site, Auto News and Reviews, the Mercedes sports coupe in question is actually made with a white gold sheeting and not gold plate. The one-of-a-kind car, an SLR McLaren super luxury sports coupe , is said to be worth around 2.5 million dollars. While not entirely made of gold (rumor has it that it may even be made of solid chrome) it does sport an 1,600 HP V10 engine that is said to be able to go from 0 to 60 in only 2 seconds. This in itself is a feat that not even a Tesla electric sports coupe can do (it goes from 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds).",McLaren SLR White Gold Mercedes and Abu Dhabi admirers,"The owner of the Mercedes gold sports coupe has still not been revealed; but in any case, one would have to have a considerable amount of money, and be willing to invest the money in such a car just to have the notoriety of being the first in the neighborhood to own and drive such a car. And cars like these are owned there, the “neighborhood” must be something to see in itself! Homes of Hollywood movie stars are probably less fancy, and even they don’t abandon their Jags and other luxury wheels in airport parking lots. Judging from the outcome of the recent South African miner’s strike at the Lomnin and Marikana mines (Platinum mines, not gold) the “price” for mining precious metals just went up; including what’s needed to make such luxury cars.","Read More on Un-Green Super Luxury Cars: Abu Dhabi’s Solid Gold “Biofuel” Mercedes Another Dubious Green Development A Gold Porsche 997 GT-2 – The Latest in Ungreen Super Luxury Gold and Armored Rolls is Most Ungreen Luxury Abandoned Jag, BMWS’s and Mercedes Gather Dust at Abu Dhabi Airport",Photos via Auto News and Reviews,Abandoned cars via The Daily Mail,comments,"wow very nice car, whether the car including the world’s most expensive car?","nice post, I became aware of a car supercar.

"If you're a Canadian transportation carrier operating in the US, then your heavy vehicles are subject to the heavy vehicle use tax (HVUT). This HVUT tax year starts July 1, 2014 and runs until June 30, 2015. Below is some important information about the HVUT:","Vehicles subject to the HVUT: If your vehicle has a taxable weight of 55,000 pounds or more (including trucks, tractors, and buses), you’re subject to the tax. The taxable weight is the empty gross weight of the vehicle, plus the empty weights of any attached trailers, plus the heaviest weight of the loads the vehicle and/or trailers will carry.",How “2290” is related to the HVUT: “2290” is the IRS form number used to file the HVUT. The HVUT is filed using IRS Form 2290 and Schedule 1.,"Who must file and pay the HVUT: You’re required to file the form and schedule if a taxable highway motor vehicle is registered, or required to be registered, in your name under any state or District of Columbia, Canadian, or Mexican law at the time of its first use during the reporting period.","How the HVUT is calculated: The HVUT is based on the taxable weights of the vehicles and the number of vehicles in the taxable weight category. The tax for a vehicle at 55,000 pounds is $100 USD. The tax increases by $22 USD per 1,000 pounds over 55,000 pounds. A taxable vehicle that is at 80,000 pounds taxable weight is $550 USD. For example, for five vehicles with a taxable gross weight of 80,000 pounds ($550 USD each), the total tax would be $2,750 USD.","When the HVUT filing is due: This year’s returns are due by the last day of the month following the month of the vehicle’s first taxable use in the reporting period. For example, if the first taxable use of your vehicles is on July 1, 2014, then you need to file Form 2290 and Schedule 1 and pay any tax due by August 31, 2014.","Adding a vehicle to a fleet partway through the year: If any vehicle is placed into service at any time during the reporting period and is operated in the US, you must file an additional Form 2290 and Schedule 1 and pay tax due, if applicable. For example, you purchase a taxable vehicle on December 5, 2014, and the vehicle is required to be registered in your name and the vehicle is first used in December. In this case, you must file an additional Form 2290 and Schedule 1 and pay the tax due before January 31, 2015. Since it’s a partial year filing, you pay a reduced amount based on the number of months remaining in the year.","What to do if the taxable weight on a vehicle increases: If a vehicle's gross weight increases, you will need to file an amended return and pay additional tax due on the increased weight.","How to claim a suspension of tax: If your vehicle will operate 5,000 miles or less during the tax year, you will still have to file Form 2290 and Schedule 1, but no tax payment is required because you’ve claimed a suspension. If, however, you end up operating the vehicle more than 5,000 miles during the tax year, you must then file an amendment to your original filing and pay the tax due.","When electronic filing of HVUT is required: If you have 25 or more vehicles, you are required to file the HVUT electronically. However, the IRS encourages all taxpayers to file electronically. There are benefits even if you have fewer than 25 vehicles. You can print your proof of tax payment within minutes after the IRS accepts your return and you do not need to wait for paper copies to arrive in the mail.","Enforcement of the HVUT: If you’re based in Canada and are operating taxable vehicles into the United States, then you do need to carry proof of HVUT filing. You may be asked to provide proof of filing to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer.","For more information on the HVUT, please visit Instructions for Form 2290 published by the Internal Revenue Service.","Source: HVUT Frequently Asked Questions by J.J. Keller & Associates, Inc (July 2, 2014).",,"Tia Chisholm, HUB International TRANSPORTATION","HUB International TRANSPORTATION specialists are based in Vancouver.

Please read the rules before joining the discussion.,"His friendship with recently acquired Nikola Mirotic was one of the reasons Pau Gasol (left) wanted to play for the Bucks, not against them. (Photo: Darren Hauck, Associated Press)","TEMPE, Ariz. - Pau Gasol found himself in a basketball situation that no longer worked for him. As a member of the San Antonio Spurs, the 38-year-old center wasn't getting many opportunities to contribute on the court and at this stage of his career, he desired a chance to change that reality sooner than later.","Over time, he began to believe there was at least a small chance he could negotiate a buyout agreement with the Spurs and enter the free-agent market. The Milwaukee Bucks were one of the teams he thought could be the right fit, so he picked up his phone and sent out a text to Bucks forward Nikola Mirotic, a former teammate both on the Chicago Bulls and Spanish national team.","""Niko, I need to talk to you,"" Gasol texted, immediately alerting Mirotic that the topic was something significant. That's not the kind of text most people follow up with casual conversation.","Gasol told Mirotic of what could possibly be on the horizon. He was gathering information and needed to know what the Bucks were like from someone on the inside, someone he trusted. Mirotic has only been with the team since Feb. 7 when he arrived via a deadline-day trade, but Gasol was still interested in his first impressions.",Mirotic described coming to Milwaukee as winning the lottery.,"“So far what I feel is a great feeling – great teammates, great organization, great chemistry,"" Mirotic recalled at Monday's shootaround held at Arizona State University. ""That’s all I told him. I said, ‘Listen, man, I really feel this team is special and if you want to be part of something special you should join this team.’ That’s all I told him and I really felt that way.”","Gasol was suitably impressed by what Mirotic had to say, but at that point, it was still too early in the process to know if it would matter. He still needed to work out a buyout with the Spurs among other variables.","That didn't stop Mirotic from getting excited. He texted Gasol every day after that hoping for an update. On Friday, the last day players could be bought out and maintain their playoff eligibility with a new team, Mirotic's text frequency increased.","“He was texting me almost every hour like, ‘Something new? Something happen yet?'"" Gasol recalled with a laugh.","But in the final hour before the 4 p.m. deadline, the contract buyout went through. According to a report from The Athletic, Gasol gave back $2.5 million to the Spurs as part of the deal, which made him a free agent and opened a path to signing a minimum deal with the Bucks for the rest of the season.","“The Spurs, I have to be thankful for them and to them as well for allowing me to get out with enough time to be able to sign with the Bucks,"" Gasol said. ""If we had waited another 20, 30 minutes it would have been no go.”","Of course, Gasol had to wait two days to clear waivers before he could officially sign with the Bucks. That didn't stop a giddy Mirotic, who was immediately tweeting about Gasol after news began to spread about his intent to join Milwaukee for the stretch run.",Vamos @paugasol 🧩,"“He couldn’t help himself,"" Gasol said.","Gasol signed with the Bucks on Sunday and met them in Phoenix. He participated in Monday's shootaround and stayed late to play five-on-five with a group of players, coaches and team staff that included Donte DiVincenzo, D.J. Wilson, Christian Wood, Bonzie Colson and Trevon Duval. Bucks guards George Hill and Sterling Brown stuck around to watch and show their support.","They played three, four-minute games that were competitive but not overly intense, with Gasol building chemistry and making mental notes about his new teammates as he went along. By the third game, he was in a bit of a groove as scored inside, dished a nice pocket pass to DiVincenzo for a dunk and earned praise from assistant coach Charles Lee – one of his teammates – for his help on defense.","“Obviously great team going through a great stretch right now,"" Gasol said when asked why he chose to join the Bucks. ""I just want to be able to be a part of it and add to it and give the team a better chance especially in the postseason.""","What part Gasol will play remains to be determined. The 7-footer joins a crowded frontcourt that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, Mirotic, Ersan Ilyasova, Wilson and Brook Lopez. Of that group, all but Wilson have been regular members of the rotation since the all-star break.","Gasol gives the Bucks a true center as a backup to Lopez, but it will still be a tough task for coach Mike Budenholzer to figure out how to best use Gasol. As someone who left San Antonio because he wanted to play more – he averaged 12.2 minutes in 27 games this season, including missing 26 games in November and December with a stress fracture in his left foot – Gasol didn't get any promises regarding playing time from the Bucks.","Instead, Budenholzer asked for Gasol just to trust him.","""He said, ‘I’m a smart coach, I’ll figure it out,' "" Gasol said. “There’s not like an urgent need. … Just got to work your way into it and little by little be able to add here and there. That’s it, whatever’s needed.”","Bucks point guard Eric Bledsoe made his four-year, $70 million contract extension official on Monday. He signed it in Phoenix hours before the Bucks played the Suns, the team he was exiled from last season prior to getting traded to Milwaukee.","“We are excited that Eric will continue to be a core part of the Milwaukee Bucks,” Bucks general manager Jon Horst said. “Eric is instrumental to our success and we’re proud that he is committed to the Bucks.”","According to a report by The Athletic, the final year of Bledsoe's contract includes a partial guarantee of $3.9 million if the Bucks waive him by June 30, 2022. If the Bucks keep Bledsoe on the roster beyond that point, he will make the full $19,375,000 stipulated for the 2022-'23 season.","Brewers 4, Cubs 2: Yelich, Davies, Hader star","Bucks 115, Hawks 107: Not great, but good enough when it matters",Dougherty: LaFleur signals how Rodgers must change his ways,FOLLOW JS SPORTS: Like our Facebook Page for the latest news,SUPPORT JOURNALISM: Subscribe to the Journal Sentinel today,

"The only problem is, what if you're not leading in your hockey pool? Well, you can still have a good night and decimate your opponents, or a strong last 10 days where your team out scored all others, or you may have picked that one dark horse player in the late rounds that turns out to be in the Top 30 scorers. That deserves to be recognized, and with THE Hockey Pool, it is recognized. You don't have to worry about updating the stats, or waiting until the newspaper comes out. The special daily charts provide you with all sorts of personal, specific to your pool, break-downs in a variety of areas. We also keep track of the top scoring un-drafted players and goaltenders (if your pool has them) so if your pool involves re-drafts or trades, you have the best information possible about the available players. Q: The season is already started, can I still register? A: Yes, you can register any time until the end of the season and see your stats instantly. We keep track of the stats on a day-by-day basis so we are able to show historical stats no matter when you register your pool. Q: Do I need Java or any other plugins to use this service? A: No. All you need is a table capable browser. Oh, and the ability to pick a winning team! Q: Is this a form of gambling? A: There is no gambling associated with this site what-so-ever. If you decide to gamble within your group on the outcome of the pool, please check your local laws. We provide this hockey statistical analysis service for entertainment only. Q: When are the stats updated? A: The stats are updated daily, after the last game of the night or after each game during the playoffs from the official NHL Game Report. We run a conform with the NHL stats again everyday around noon to catch any scoring plays made after the Game Report was published. We publish scoring changes in many places when they occur: At the top of the Daily Stats Page. On our point re-awards page linked from the top left column of the Daily Stats Page or you can use this link. On our Twitter feed On our Facebook page If you feel a mistake has been made, we use the NHL.com as the official, final word. Points are commonly re-awarded the day after the game, and can still change even several days after the game. In case of any dispute between sources about a stats total, the NHL.com's stats are used as the final, Official stats. Q: What type of pools can be kept track of using this service? A: Your pool can be a straight draft with only one owner of each specific player, or a box draft where multiple owners can have the same player. It is all up to you, the pool administrator. You enter your pool's teams, if those teams have the same players, the stats service will still work perfectly. Of course some of the charts we produce are less relevant for drafts with multiple owners of the same player, so your pool administrator can customize which charts are displayed each day. You can have all drafted players totals count towards your team's total score, or you can limit the total to only include the top scorers (ie. Only the top 10 of your 13 players count towards your total points). See this document for more information on this feature. You, as pool administrator can trade players between teams or replace players by using your pool login and password, and editing the players on the respective teams. This gives you a lot of power over your pool, but we count on your friends and co-workers to keep you in line. (They won't be too happy if you try to trade Sergei Fedorov to your team in exchange for Tie Domi without the other party's consent.) We can track active/reserve roster pools. More information. Q: Can we trade players? A: Yes. Click here for more information. And also see: My pool involves trades which can result in an un-equal number of players on each team. How do I set that up? Q: Can I compete against other people on the net with this service? A: Not yet. Our service currently keeps track of an existing pool which you can run with your friends and/or co-workers. You serve as the administrator for the pool. Once your group has choosen it's players (in what ever way you see fit), you set up the teams for each ""owner"" of a team. Q: How do I change a player from, say, VYACHESLAV KOZLOV to VIKTOR KOZLOV? A: If the player's last name is a common one in the NHL and you accidentally selected the wrong one on the Edit Team page, simply erase the entire name, re-enter the name as if it was the first time (i.e. just enter the last name, stop at the first space) and press update again. Q: Can I keep track of just my team or do I need to keep track of the whole pool? A: At the moment you need to keep track of the entire pool. If you specify that there are 12 owners in your pool, you must enter all 12 teams. A great deal of the entertainment from this service comes from seeing the headlines, charts and comparisons which are generated each morning, and for these to work, the service needs to see how your team is doing compared to everyone else's team. If your pool is too large to enter, you could always enter a sub-set of the teams. But if you don't enter all of the teams, how will you know when you're winning? Q: My pool involves trades which can result in an un-equal number of players on each team. How do I set that up? A: There are a number of possible ways: Best Method: Register your pool with the minimum (initial) number of players, then Trade Players to the teams that have extra drafted players. Alternative Method: Register your pool with the maximum allowable players on a team, for example, if you drafted 22 players but due to trades a team can contain up to 30 players, you would specify 30 players in the appropriate field on the registration page. Then, when inputting the teams, fill out the 22 drafted players. THE Hockey Pool does not like blank player fields so the remaining 8 (30-22) players must be filled in. Fortunately, there is a player named ""No One"" in the database who will never have any points. Set any extra players to this player. When trades occur, replace the player ""No One"" with the traded player, and continue to enjoy your stats. Q: Can I change the number of Owners or Players once I have registered? A: Yes. On the Admin page, go to Change Number of Owners/Players. You can change the number of Players drafted at any time NOTE: Now that this is a pay per poolie service you cannot INCREASE the number of owners if you paid for less than 20 owners. If you paid for more than 20 owners, you can change the number of owners at any time. If you paid for fewer than 20 owners and need to increase that number, please contact us and we'll get you set up. For the World Cup or any other flat-fee seasons, you can increase or decrease the number of owners at any time. Q: Should I give out the Pool's Password to everyone in the pool? A: No. Giving out the Password is a good way to create chaos. The Password is used to prevent anyone but you from changing the players on the teams and performing any other maintainance tasks. The other people in the pool do not need the password to access the Daily Stats Page. Q: Once the pool is set up, how do we access our Daily Stats Page? A: Simple. Go to: http://www.TheHockeyPool.com/cgi/DailyStatsPage.cgi?Pool=[your_Pool_Login_goes_here] For example, if your Pool Login is ThemGoons, you can access: http://www.TheHockeyPool.com/cgi/DailyStatsPage.cgi?Pool=ThemGoons Of course, it is much easier to bookmark the page. Q: I'm pretty sure I remember my password correctly, but it isn't letting me login. What's going on? A: It could be a few things; The upper and lower case-ness of your Pool Login and Password matter (ie. ""themgoons"" is different from ""ThemGoons"") . Be sure that you have the case correct. Spaces are considered part of the password so if you have placed a space before or after the password, or if you have placed a space before or after your login ID, this may cause the login to fail. If you have not accessed your pool for over two months, we have compacted it to save space. If it has been 3 months since you accessed your pool, we have deleted it completely. Contact us if you still can't login in properly. We'll try to rectify the problem as soon as possible. There is an automatic look-up process on the bad-login page now that will look up all pools registered to a given email address, so if you know your administrator's email address, you can find the Pool Login's that they have registered. Q: One of my players seems to have lost points last night, or a player who did not play last night gained points. What happened? A: The NHL stats are official, but can still change; the NHL reviews scoring plays made during the week and may re-award goals and assists based on video, interviews with players, coaches, etc. If the NHL does re-awards points, your players may experience point changes (positively or negatively for you) even if they didn't play last night. Q: You are asking for my email address. Are you going to sell this information to anyone or spam me? A: No, your email address is used soley to insure the integrity of the registration process. We find junk email to be offensive and would never subject anyone to this indignity for the sake of a few bucks. We will never disclose your email address to anyone else.

When trades occur, replace the player ""No One"" with the traded player, and continue to enjoy your stats. Q: Can I change the number of Owners or Players once I have registered? A: Yes. On the Admin page, go to Change Number of Owners/Players. You can change the number of Players drafted at any time NOTE: Now that this is a pay per poolie service you cannot INCREASE the number of owners if you paid for less than 20 owners. If you paid for more than 20 owners, you can change the number of owners at any time. If you paid for fewer than 20 owners and need to increase that number, please contact us and we'll get you set up. For the World Cup or any other flat-fee seasons, you can increase or decrease the number of owners at any time. Q: Should I give out the Pool's Password to everyone in the pool? A: No. Giving out the Password is a good way to create chaos. The Password is used to prevent anyone but you from changing the players on the teams and performing any other maintainance tasks. The other people in the pool do not need the password to access the Daily Stats Page. Q: Once the pool is set up, how do we access our Daily Stats Page? A: Simple. Go to: http://www.TheHockeyPool.com/cgi/DailyStatsPage.cgi?Pool=[your_Pool_Login_goes_here] For example, if your Pool Login is ThemGoons, you can access: http://www.TheHockeyPool.com/cgi/DailyStatsPage.cgi?Pool=ThemGoons Of course, it is much easier to bookmark the page. Q: I'm pretty sure I remember my password correctly, but it isn't letting me login. What's going on? A: It could be a few things; The upper and lower case-ness of your Pool Login and Password matter (ie. ""themgoons"" is different from ""ThemGoons"") . Be sure that you have the case correct. Spaces are considered part of the password so if you have placed a space before or after the password, or if you have placed a space before or after your login ID, this may cause the login to fail. If you have not accessed your pool for over two months, we have compacted it to save space. If it has been 3 months since you accessed your pool, we have deleted it completely. Contact us if you still can't login in properly. We'll try to rectify the problem as soon as possible. There is an automatic look-up process on the bad-login page now that will look up all pools registered to a given email address, so if you know your administrator's email address, you can find the Pool Login's that they have registered. Q: One of my players seems to have lost points last night, or a player who did not play last night gained points. What happened? A: The NHL stats are official, but can still change; the NHL reviews scoring plays made during the week and may re-award goals and assists based on video, interviews with players, coaches, etc. If the NHL does re-awards points, your players may experience point changes (positively or negatively for you) even if they didn't play last night. Q: You are asking for my email address. Are you going to sell this information to anyone or spam me? A: No, your email address is used soley to insure the integrity of the registration process. We find junk email to be offensive and would never subject anyone to this indignity for the sake of a few bucks. We will never disclose your email address to anyone else.

Only the top 10 of your 13 players count towards your total points). See this document for more information on this feature. You, as pool administrator can trade players between teams or replace players by using your pool login and password, and editing the players on the respective teams. This gives you a lot of power over your pool, but we count on your friends and co-workers to keep you in line. (They won't be too happy if you try to trade Sergei Fedorov to your team in exchange for Tie Domi without the other party's consent.) We can track active/reserve roster pools. More information. Q: Can we trade players? A: Yes. Click here for more information. And also see: My pool involves trades which can result in an un-equal number of players on each team. How do I set that up? Q: Can I compete against other people on the net with this service? A: Not yet. Our service currently keeps track of an existing pool which you can run with your friends and/or co-workers. You serve as the administrator for the pool. Once your group has choosen it's players (in what ever way you see fit), you set up the teams for each ""owner"" of a team. Q: How do I change a player from, say, VYACHESLAV KOZLOV to VIKTOR KOZLOV? A: If the player's last name is a common one in the NHL and you accidentally selected the wrong one on the Edit Team page, simply erase the entire name, re-enter the name as if it was the first time (i.e. just enter the last name, stop at the first space) and press update again. Q: Can I keep track of just my team or do I need to keep track of the whole pool? A: At the moment you need to keep track of the entire pool. If you specify that there are 12 owners in your pool, you must enter all 12 teams. A great deal of the entertainment from this service comes from seeing the headlines, charts and comparisons which are generated each morning, and for these to work, the service needs to see how your team is doing compared to everyone else's team. If your pool is too large to enter, you could always enter a sub-set of the teams. But if you don't enter all of the teams, how will you know when you're winning? Q: My pool involves trades which can result in an un-equal number of players on each team. How do I set that up? A: There are a number of possible ways: Best Method: Register your pool with the minimum (initial) number of players, then Trade Players to the teams that have extra drafted players. Alternative Method: Register your pool with the maximum allowable players on a team, for example, if you drafted 22 players but due to trades a team can contain up to 30 players, you would specify 30 players in the appropriate field on the registration page. Then, when inputting the teams, fill out the 22 drafted players. THE Hockey Pool does not like blank player fields so the remaining 8 (30-22) players must be filled in.

Thu04182019,"Last updateTue, 04 Dec 2018 12pm",The 2019 School Rugby season is now in full swing as most of the teams are in action around the country. Keep up-to-date with all the results right here:,"Over the past year, Jeppe’s water polo has seen a steep climb on the leader boards. Between having six of their players, across various age groups, currently in the South African teams, despite not being able to produce as many in previous years, and their first team cementing their place as a top contender at all major tournaments, the big question on everybody’s mind is, ‘How are they doing it?’",Few would dispute that SACS have put in a master class this season and are ostensibly the leading team in the nation after enjoying one of their finest years in the pool.,It has been a sensational season from the St Stithians Water Polo team who rest at the top of the SA School Sports Rankings after finishing this stage of 2019 unbeaten.,"In the last 3 articles, I have offered a framework with clarifying questions that you can use to document a personal Coaching Philosophy.",The four pillars of the framework are:,"As you start finalising your coaching philosophy, I want to challenge you to consider what true success is? I do realise that many of you are coaching in a highly professional environment and that your job is on the line if you don’t bring home the trophies however it is important to pause and ponder and make sure that you don’t define an athlete or a team by one bad moment or a poor season. Imagine if the whole of life was measured like this?","Life isn’t measured this way – there are second chances and new beginnings. People can bounce back from a divorce or bankruptcy. I would like to suggest to you that if your players discern that you care about them on and off the field, their on field performance might go to a new level. Martina Navratilova, the woman who redefined women’s tennis said that she learnt more from a defeat than victory. Nikki Hudson former captain of the Aussie Women’s Field Hockey team played in 3 Olympic Games, three Commonwealth Games and three World Cups, collecting 4 gold medals along the way. Her career highlight was a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where she was the tournament’s leading goal scorer. She was asked:","Having been a world-­‐-­‐-­‐class athlete, how do you measure your success?","“Success is more about how you develop as a player and as a person on and off the field. It is more than just winning trophies and medals, because unfortunately no matter how well you play in a tournament, sometimes the factors are against you and you don’t always win. It doesn’t mean you are not successful. In a team environment, particularly at the highest levels, measurement of success tends to revolve around the team – how the team is performing – and sometimes the individuals forget to look at their own achievements and successes. You perfect a skill or role in your team but then forget to celebrate those small wins.",,"I restate that the topic of winning and success is a delicate and potentially highly inflammable one, however as coaches we are compelled to acknowledge that our mentorship spans beyond the field. Sports are the theatre of life! We are entrusted with young people who will retire from sport and go on to lead families and companies and possibly play a role in government. Are you a limited scope-­‐-­‐-­‐coach who is just prepping people for a game, a moment in time, or are you carrying a bigger picture in your brag book and preparing people for life? We coach a generation that is predominantly fatherless and not as connected to the nuclear family as previous generations were. As coaches we become surrogates and start assuming these foundational roles in people’s lives.","Brian Mackenzie a leading UK coach says, “In my opinion, every coaching philosophy should have a major statement on how the coach views the results of both training and competition. I cannot stress enough the importance of educating athletes that it is more important to focus on their process of development and how they performed in competition rather than the results or outcomes that they achieved. In a race or game there can be only one winner. Does that mean everyone else is a loser? If you read the newspapers that is what you would think. Therefore, to build confidence and see measurable progress and to learn positively from mistakes made I urge all coaches to focus on the process and not the outcomes with their athletes. It is important for the athletes to do the same.”","I have listed many prompt questions, but they have been included to get you to try and think about every aspect of your personality, beliefs and approach to coaching. Start clustering your answers into different themes and summarizing your approach. I have included an example of a coaching philosophy to help guide you in the process.",Example of a Coaching Philosophy taken from the AFL Level One Coaching Manual. Introduction,"My coaching philosophy revolves around my firm belief that I am privileged to help my players develop and grow as individuals – not only in Australian Football, but as people.",How I wish to be remembered as a coach,I would like to be remembered as having a significant impact on the quality of life of these players.,My Role: teaching and training,"I coach at this senior level to educate people to appreciate the game of Australian Football as being one of the most skillful games in the world. Since the game is based on players solving problems and making decisions all over the ground, my training is based on increasing the players’ understanding of the game by teaching team rules",,and a game plan that will help simplify their decision-­‐-­‐-­‐making. This requires a game/scenario style of training.,Development of a club structure,The club culture is developed by establishing our values and associated behaviours. This leadership group and the playing group monitor these behaviours. Regular constructive feedback is offered to ensure that the club maintains the club culture.,Communication style,"I possess an assertive communication style. I am an effective active listener. I clearly state my expectations. I speak honestly and immediately to people. I check on their feelings and understandings. I need to show empathy, learn to receive feedback and offer constructive feedback, resolve conflicts and create an environment of which everybody wants to be a part of.",Spend time capturing a coaching philosophy.

The frustration of daily fantasy golf comes from the fact that you have to deal with your lineup for four consecutive days. Which can come with an incredibly dangerous tilt if something were to go wrong with one of your lineups.","However, the fun of daily fantasy golf stems from the fact that it makes golf fun to watch. Moreover, for someone like me, who is 19 years old and not in the typical demographic of people who would usually watch golf on any particular weekend afternoon, this is huge.","Add in amazing people like Will Wilcox, who interact with the daily fantasy sports community (and sent me a signed ball), and you have yourself a recipe for a DFS sport that has incredible potential for growth. With that growth will be a ton of new players that have absolutely no clue what they are doing, and will just pick the familiar names that they have heard about on TV.","I am going to show you guys some ways in which you can succeed playing DFS golf, and separate you from those people that just pick the random guys that they saw talked about on Sportscenter. So without further ado, let’s get into some golf!","When I begin my weekly research for golf, I like to start by looking up the odds that different sportsbooks have on the particular tournament for that week. All of the betting sites will be in the same ballpark regarding who the top golfers will be for that week, but looking at multiple sites will give you a better idea of the favorites to win across the board.","Line movement is also an essential part of the Vegas odds. Line movement is when the odds on a golfer changes either way. We don’t need to pay attention to very small line movements, but larger line movements might indicate something to us.","If for example, Matt Kuchar starts the week at +2000 to win a tournament but his odds then moves to +1400 by Thursday morning that would be a significant line movement that we would want to look into further.","When a golfer’s odds go down like that it often means that a lot of money is coming in on that golfer. Sportsbooks won’t adjust too much if it’s just casual money coming in on a golfer, so a line movement that large would indicate some serious money is coming in on Kuchar.","This doesn’t mean you need to automatically play Kuchar in your DraftKings lineup, but it would be smart to investigate why others seem to like him to win the tournament so much.","On the other hand, if a golfer drops in odds from +2000 to +3000, for example, it might be worthwhile to check why that golfer’s odds dropped. Is he dealing with an injury that could affect his game?","Vegas golf odds are an effective tool for your PGA research, but just one of many things you need to take a look at.","After considering the Vegas odds for the week, the next thing that I look at is how a player has performed in the past at the course that a particular tournament is being played. That, along with how a player has performed on a particular type of grass that the tournament is being played. The main two used being Bermuda and Sawgrass.",Different golf courses play into different strengths and weakness of golfers.,"Using the Players Championship as an example, Jason Day was able to win that tournament not because he is a “bomber” (a player that can drive the ball an extremely far distance) but because he is a skilled golfer all around. However, that strategy does not work in all cases, with some courses curated for guys that can smack the ball and drive it for far distances. Sawgrass is also slightly more forgiving for putting.","However, the moral of the story is that course history and course fit is an important factor for you to weigh when selecting which golfers to roster on a particular week. Moreover, no, do not treat this like the ugly step child like we do in fantasy baseball with BvP.","It is also important to look at how a golfer has performed in recent history. Golf is a highly mental game. Moreover, if you start playing poorly in one tournament, it is very likely to carry over from one week to the next. If the player chooses not to take a week off in-between tournaments, this can be bad. As they are likely to have this bad performance carry over.","Rory McIlroy is an excellent example of this to an extent. Recently, he decided to take a few weeks off from the tour to improve some aspects of his swing. Feeling like his swing was lacking something. Had he played in those tournaments that he missed, he might not have performed well at all due to having negative thoughts in his head about how his swing had performed in recent tournaments that he had played.","Another great tool to use in DFS golf is Twitter. Twitter is great for many things, including obtaining the mindless thoughts of other people. If you are not too busy stalking an ex-lover on Twitter to see if they had found someone else yet, give stalking PGA golfers a try. It can be fun! You can see Jason Day getting drunk with the other golfers on the tour. You can tell that the fellow golfers are friends outside the golf course.","More importantly, though, it is an excellent way to obtain some transparency on how golfers feel about the course that they are playing on for that particular week. For example, our man Will Wilcox will always share his thoughts with us on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons on Twitter to tell us if we should play him that particular week or not. Other golfers, while not as blatantly transparent, will always share a thought or two on how their practice rounds went, and if they feel ready yet.","There are a ton of different PGA stats we can look at each week, but in general, the stats that I like to use most for my DraftKings research are driving distance, driving accuracy, greens in regulation, strokes gained, and scrambling.","With that said, different stats are more valuable at a specific course and even in specific weather, so your strategy needs to change from week to week.","For example, some courses are “bombers courses” with wide fairways and forgiving rough. At these type of courses you will want to focus on Driving Distance and Driving Accuracy doesn’t matter much.","On the other hand, you might have a course with narrow fairways and thick rough, where you will put a premium on Driving Accuracy over distance.","When golf stats are used correctly on a week to week basis you can really get ahead of your competition at DraftKings, as a lot of people will ignore specific course details and just roster the better overall golfer.","In a sport such as golf the variance is inevitable. No one can correctly project players in golf as they can in a more consistent sport as say basketball, where the good players are ALWAYS the better players.",If something is slightly off in a golfer’s swing and they fail to adjust in the first 36 holes they can miss the cut and give you almost no chance to win a DraftKings contest (as in most you will need all 6 golfers to make the cut). This will happen to even the best golfers in the world that come into the tournament playing better golf than anyone out there.,"This is what makes game theory so important in DraftKings PGA contests. A lot of the time the golfers playing the best golf will be very high owned. Knowing that golf is very random at times and it is tough to beat 150+ golfers in a week, if you can pick the popular golfers to avoid (fade) and they have a rough week you can set yourself up nicely.",Using ownership projections at FantasyLabs.com (the best DFS tool out there) we can probably find 3 or 4 golfers expected to be owned in about 25-30% of the entries. If you avoid 2 of those golfers completely and those golfers miss the cut (or even just finish poorly after making the cut) you will put yourself ahead of a lot of the lineups.,Another DraftKings PGA strategy would be to find two comparable golfers and simply take the golfer projected to be lower owned. If Golfer A is 10/1 to win the tournament and is expected to be 5% owned and Golfer B is 9/1 to win the tournament but expected to be 35% owned I would go with Golfer A just based on ownership (GPP strategy only).,,That’s it for the DraftKings golf strategies. Hopefully it has helped you become a sharper DFS golf player and help you win some money!,Sharpen up your skills by reading my DFS Bankroll Management Strategies article.
"After making a very solid recovery from slow pace in the first days of official WorldSBK Phillip Island testing, to running close to the front in qualifying Leon Camier and the highl HRC -upported Moriwaki Althea Honda team could have exceeded initial expectations again in the first three races of the season.","In reality, however, Camier is 16th in the championship table after one race finish of tenth in the regular second race – in the 2019 season that means the final race on the weekend.","Camier was unmoved by having two races on Sunday, as well as one race on Saturday to deal with in 2019. “It was just another race, so get on with it really. We struggled a lot in the sprint race this morning, however. I felt pretty good yesterday and felt we were going forward and had the potential to push on with Melandri and Cortese. This morning I felt really bad. Struggling to do what I wanted on track in cooler conditions,” Camier told bikesportnews.com",“And then I also got into trouble this morning off the start. I got hooked up with a load people and I think Toprak hit me twice. Rinaldi went right off track in front of me and I got caught up in all of that. Then this afternoon in the second race the bike felt a fair bit better again - but for sure we lose early on.,"“There are as few areas where we lose, which does not help, but then as the race goes on it becomes a bit more even. I think I could have gone with Chaz if I could have got through the traffic as well as him. The pace was I think similar, if anything I was just catching Cortese, but yes, there are a few areas we are losing, that would make a big difference in racing - in races.”","On balance it has been an up and down first real contact with WorldSBK and Honda, HRC and the hybrid Moriwaki/Althea team. Camier agrees it has been a series of ups and downs.","“Yes, it is all part of it,” he stated. “We are just trying to understand what is making it better and what is making it worse. We made some good progress over the weekend, really good, but then it seemed to be a little bit harder this morning on Sunday. To race is one thing - and to go fast is one thing. When you are getting beaten up and people are coming past you and holding you up in up in the corners - it is difficult to race like that.”","Camier is not confident that the next round in Thailand, at the Chang International Circuit, will be a happy hunting ground, even if it is where he tested the Suzuka 8-Hour style Fireblade first of all. He may get some new parts to try. Maybe.","“Parts, I hope so,” he said. “Understanding how Honda and HRC work it seems like it is as step-by-step process. It is not going to be ten things to try in one weekend. It might be one thing it might be not a lot. It will be a gradual process of improving. I think there will be tracks that are better for us and some track where we will be finding it quite hard. But that is pretty normal. Chang will be really hard. I think it is going to be harder there.”","© Copyright 2019 Bike Sport News. www.bikesportnews.com is the racing website for all the BSB and MotoGP racing news from across the world.

Matches in this gameweek include a heated derby, a battle between old foes and a few potentially close matches. But before we look too far ahead, let’s refresh our minds of what happened last time in the league.",​,"Manchester United fans have to settle for chasing for the top four after a 2-2 draw against Southampton left them eight points behind fourth place Arsenal. United continued to frustrate their fans by falling behind two goals early to Southampton, which sacked manager Mark Hughes after the match. Some in United’s quarters feel that Mourinho’s tenure won’t last much longer either.",​,"Elsewhere, Liverpool grabbed the spoils against Everton, benefitting from a late goalkeeping blunder that handed them all three points in a 1-0 victory. Meanwhile, Arsenal highlighted why they’ll always be the best team in north London, hammering Tottenham 4-2. The result lifted the Gunners, which remain unbeaten in their last 19 games, into the top four.",​,​,​,,Other results not listed from Week 14,​,Cardiff City 2 | Wolverhampton Wanderers 1,​,Crystal Palace 2 | Burnley 0,​,Huddersfield Town 1 | Brighton & Hove Albion 2,​,Leicester City 2 | Watford 0,​,Manchester City 3 | AFC Bournemouth 1,​,Newcastle United 0 | West Ham United 3,​,Chelsea 2 | Fulham 0,​,​,​,"All eyes will be the Red Devils and Gunners on Wednesday night, as Manchester United hosts Arsenal. For the first time in more than 20 years, Arsene Wenger will not be in the visiting dugout, meaning Mourinho won’t be able to play his usual mind games. United won both fixtures last season, but it seems repeating those outcomes will be much more difficult for the Red Devils this season.",​,"Manchester United seems to be a team only in name with too many individuals and an out of touch manager who continues to bore faithful fans. Meanwhile, Arsenal fans finally have something to scream about and should feel confident of the Gunners picking up all three points when they visit Old Trafford. The free-scoring talents of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette will likely prove too much for United’s leaking defense.",​,Below are all the matches that await us in the midweek:,,​,,,"Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2018",​,AFC Bournemouth (4-2-6) vs. Huddersfield Town (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Brighton & Hove Albion (4-2-6) vs. Crystal Palace (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,West Ham United (4-2-6) vs. Cardiff City (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Watford (4-2-6) vs. Manchester City (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,​,​,"Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018",​,Burnley (4-2-6) vs. Liverpool (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Everton (4-2-6) vs. Newcastle United (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Fulham (4-2-6) vs. Leicester City (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Wolverhampton Wanderers (4-2-6) vs. Chelsea (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Manchester United (4-2-6) vs. Arsenal (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,​,Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-6) vs. Southampton (5-2-5) | 7:45 p.m. BST - 2:45 p.m. ET,E-mail: mattbell2@mail.com,You Might Also Like,"© 2019 The Sports Haven, LLC | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | All rights reserved."

It's on Al Ahly sporting club's sign on an island in the Nile and on black T-shirts around Egypt, the numerals filled in with the names of football fans who died six years ago in one of the most violent instances of Egypt’s revolution and of football worldwide.","It started after a game between Al Ahly, the powerhouse of Egyptian football, and Al Masry from the Suez Canal city of Port Said. As the final whistle blew, fans stormed the field. Players and fans tried to escape, but they found some gates locked shut and 74 died in stampedes or from blunt trauma. Revolutionaries thought it was orchestrated by the state, others said it was negligence.","Following the disaster, authorities banned spectators from all Egyptian league matches across the country. On Friday, those same two teams will play in front of fans for the first time since that tragic night in 2012. But it will not be in Egypt. Instead the Egyptian Supercup, played between the winners of the Egypt Cup and the Egyptian Premier League, will be decided at Hazza bin Zayed stadium in Al Ain, UAE.","Beyond the loss of life, the effects of the violence — which many in Egypt called a massacre — carried on into Egyptian football. Security decisions made it difficult to organise games. Empty stands affected television viewership. Disconnected from their fan base, Egyptian players dipped in performance level.","“We knew each other and knew a lot about each other. We’re a close community. If you don’t know someone personally, you know their face,” said Hicham El Feky, a lifelong Ahly fan who became brand manager at the club and designed the T-shirt commemorating the victims. “We lost a lot of our friends, and a lot of things were broken during that match, unfortunately. Many people lost their interest in football. It became difficult to know which teams were popular or not.”","Al Ahly and Al Masry last met in November, when Al Ahly won 2-0. But this is the first time they will play each other in front of fans.","The last decade of Hosni Mubarak’s regime was a boom time for Egyptian football, with the advent of satellite television with dedicated channels, investment from the government and international victories for Egyptian teams. Several defeats,most notably to Algeria in 2009, left fans disillusioned and then came the 2011 revolution and Port Said.","“Several events add up to this sort of breakup of this boom,” said Carl Rommel, an anthropologist who studies Egyptian football. “The massacre is the most important of these events.”","Mohamed El Erian is an Al Masry fan because of its roots in Egyptian nationalism and Port Said. The club was founded after Egypt’s 1919 revolution against the British, and its green kit symbolises the flag of that period. When Port Said was evacuated during the wars with Israel, Al Masry club games became a gathering point for the displaced, he said.",It is for that reason that merely playing before a crowd of fans is not enough for Mr El Erian. note-1,"“We will go back to our stadium in Port Said. It’s a matter of time and we believe in this — it’s our right. Even if there are some people that committed a mistake, we cannot judge all people,” he said.","Mr Rommel is not so sure. “I think it's likely that fans will return but I also have a feeling that the authorities are quite happy not allowing full stadiums,” he said.","Violence still breaks out at football matches and the authorities come down hard. A decision to ease the ban on supporters in stadiums was reversed almost immediately in February 2015, when police fired birdshot and tear gas into fans at a match between Zamalek and ENNPI in Cairo and 22 were killed. Last July, police took 236 fans into custody, claiming they had vandalised a stadium in Alexandria. More than 200, many of them hardcore fans known as Ultras, were released in December.",____________,Read more:,Egypt's top court upholds 10 death sentences over football violence,Football fans crushed to death in Cairo stadium stampede,____________,"Ultras have a contentious relationship with the police and club leadership, and in 2015 they were banned by an Egyptian court. Graffiti, saying “ACAB”, an abbreviation for a profane anti-police slogan, and “football is for the fans” is among the most common forms of vandalism in Cairo, and is usually understood to be the work of Ultras.","International leagues require clubs to allow audiences into games, so fans have been returning slowly. But those matches have not been open to the general public, only to club delegations. There are still no fans allowed at domestic football matches.","The success of the Egyptian national team, led by superstar Mohamed Salah — recently-crowned African Player of the Year and currently top scorer in the English premiership with Liverpool — to their first time World Cup since 1990, has begun to lift football out of the doldrums. But Mr Rommel does not believe the game will regain the heights of its popularity in Egypt in the mid-2000s.","The absence of cheering supporters affects performance and memories of the revolution are long. On the other hand, Mr Rommel points out that fans and players who are around the 20 mark now were only 13 at the time of the revolution, and they may not associate football so closely with the massacre.","“Maybe we shouldn’t over-emphasise these revolutionary events of five, six years ago,” he said.","About 3,600 tickets for Friday's match have been sold in Egypt, according to Presentation Sports, the company responsible for ticketing. Abu Dhabi police have mobilised 15 security forces including anti-riot, special forces, air ambulance and canine units, and called on fans to ""commit to civilised cheering and to co-operate with police forces to maintain public security.""","Fans like Mr Feky, who will attend the match in Al Ain, hope that the game is a precursor to watching their team play at home again. Mr El Erian, who will see his team play in an international fixture next month, has more modest hopes for the Supercup.","“We’re looking forward to a good match and in good faith, to have a good relationship between the fans and players.”","Updated: January 12, 2018 02:35 PM",Salah calls for Middle East attitude change on gender issues,Saudi Arabia to host G20 Leaders' Summit,Iraq votes to ban online game PUBG for 'inciting violence',Netanyahu confirmed as Israel PM under shadow of corruption cases,Trump to release Middle East peace plan after Ramadan,Salah calls for Middle East attitude change on gender issues,Saudi Arabia to host G20 Leaders' Summit,Iraq votes to ban online game PUBG for 'inciting violence',Netanyahu confirmed as Israel PM under shadow of corruption cases,Trump to release Middle East peace plan after Ramadan,Meal deals and egg hunts to seek out this Easter,Full Pink Moon 2019: what is it and how did it get its name?,South Africans abroad must prepare for new 'expat tax',This Abu Dhabi hotel is the world's most Instagrammable,UAE consumers to wait longer to get Samsung Fold,Orphans of ISIS: children forsaken in Syrian camps,Former Qatar PM 'sabotaged' London penthouse sale to Saudi buyer,Princess Reema sworn in as Saudi ambassador to the US,Trump to release Middle East peace plan after Ramadan,Salah calls for Middle East attitude change on gender issues,Egypt constitutional changes set for weekend referendum,Lebanon public servants strike amid fears of pay cuts,Exiled uncle of Bashar Al Assad to face trial in France,UAE sends relief to victims of Iranian floods,The Middle East Framed: regional photos of the day,Egypt constitutional changes set for weekend referendum,Lebanon public servants strike amid fears of pay cuts,Exiled uncle of Bashar Al Assad to face trial in France,UAE sends relief to victims of Iranian floods,The Middle East Framed: regional photos of the day

In fact, he nearly payed for the decision in a one-sided seventh round, as Ortiz landed combination after combination and had the champion out on his feet. But Wilder proved what a true champion he is, as he somehow weathered the storm and made it out of the round.",,"The champion then came roaring back en route to a vicious 10th round knockout of Ortiz, silencing all of his critics and pushing his record to 40-0 with 39 KO’s.",,"Wilder has been vocal that he only wants to fight the best in boxing’s heavyweight division. Nevertheless, many have called his resume “weak.” Well, after Saturday’s performance, no one can question Tuscaloosa’s toughest any longer.",,"Wilder was scheduled to fight Ortiz in November, but the fight was cancelled after Ortiz tested positive for banned substances. Wilder could have used that crutch and waited for the next fight, which most likely assume would be a unification bout against the winner of the Anthony Joshua and Joseph Parker fight that will take place later this month. Instead, Wilder wanted to prove how game he is and fight a boxer no one else seems to want to fight. With the victory over Ortiz, Wilder retained his title for the seventh time.",,"Regardless of the winner between Joshua and Parker, there are no excuses for Wilder to not face the victor. The dream matchup would be Wilder against Joshua, because they both have large statures and hit like a truck. However, a unification bout hasn’t meant this much to boxing’s heavyweight division in some time, so either fighter against Wilder would be a great matchup.",,"After his comeback for the ages against Ortiz, the 32-year-old Wilder deserves his chance at the glory of unifying the division. He has called out Joshua for more than a year and if Joshua defeats Parker, there’s no logical reason to avoid Wilder vs. Joshua any longer.",,"Joshua is a giant star overseas, and Wilder has solidified his position as the biggest heavyweight boxing star in the United States. Where they will fight, should the fight get booked, would be the biggest question. Both sides believe the other should travel to their neck of the woods for the fight.",,"If Parker pulls off the upset against Joshua, it would be a great selling point for a Wilder vs. Parker unification fight. Parker and his team have shown interest in a fight with Wilder, even showing up in Alabama for his fight with Gerald Washington.",,"Wilder is the WBC champion, Parker is the WBO champion and Joshua is IBF and WBA champion. All three fighters are undefeated, so the only thing left to do now is unify the belts.",E-mail: patrickblairkmku@gmail.com,"© 2019 The Sports Haven, LLC | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | All rights reserved."
,"All of a sudden, Arsenal’s season feels alive with possibility. They are used to flirting with disaster and that is why there was little surprise when, a week ago, they threw away a promising position in Rennes to land on the brink of elimination from the Europa League. It is also why their consummate 3-0 dismissal of the French side on Thursday felt unfamiliar: like a confident and battle-hardened team mastering an unenviable situation in the manner of potential competition winners.","Arsenal could have been sixth in the Premier League on Sunday and out of Europe this evening; instead they are in the top four and the quarterfinals, respectively, and the question now is how many further gears they can go through? A limping campaign has been transformed into two months — and perhaps as many as 13 games — of high-octane, do-or-die duels.",It’s time to find a way to fix the Champions League — or start a European super league.,"ESPN+ is America’s home for a host of professional soccer leagues from around the world, highlighted by Italy’s Serie A, Major League Soccer, UEFA Nations League and English FA Cup. | ESPN+ schedule","“It’s given us very big confidence, against Manchester United on Sunday [when they won 2-0] and with this victory,” Unai Emery said after Rennes were blown away by three unanswered goals. “This comeback was very difficult but our reaction was very good. Playing under pressure is good. Growing up under pressure, for each player, for the team, you feel difficult moments to give us our best performance.”","Emery feels Arsenal have shown that, when the heat is on, they can deliver. Perhaps it is what this group of players, who have tended to switch off when the odds are overwhelmingly in their favour, requires. In the first 15 minutes of this second leg they were irresistible, showing no nerves in flying from the traps and quickly overhauling Rennes’ two-goal advantage through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, deserving their lead even if the second goal owed much to an absent offside flag. After that they largely held Rennes, whose favoured tactic seemed to be attempting to draw Arsenal into a scrap, at arm’s length before Aubameyang tapped in a third 18 minutes from time.","It was a convincing display, even if — similarly to the win over United — it was hardly a 90-minute exhibition of flowing football. Emery expressed mild disappointment that Arsenal had not shown more control with the ball but, more than anything, was delighted that over their past two games they have “been competitive.”","They will have to maintain that level between now and May. Since the Europa League winners were rewarded with a Champions League spot, the question of priorities has become a popular one. It was asked of Manchester United when, in 2016-17, they juggled an unsuccessful top-four battle with a victorious Europa League campaign. Does one get in the way of the other? An argument can be made that Arsenal, whose squad is not necessarily stacked with reliable game-changers, might count the cost of flogging the same players on both fronts with two games a week from here on. But, having worked so hard to get into position at this stage of the season, can you really throw all your chips in one direction?","Emery stressed here that Arsenal will treat every assignment equally. Instinct says the combination of Manchester United and Chelsea, Arsenal’s chief rivals for the top four, ultimately poses a greater and more sustained challenge than most of their possible paths to the Europa League trophy — even if Maurizio Sarri’s side are arguably their biggest obstacle to that. Emery, the Europa League specialist extraordinaire, noted the “big surprises” that knocked Inter Milan and Sevilla out of the tournament, and it was hard not to sense him smelling an opportunity.","“I said to my players, ‘I am excited for this competition,'” he said. “It’s a title. We can feel the possibility to win a title with a difficult moment like today.”","While his team navigated the pressure points perfectly, Emery did too. With Rennes getting on top in the second half, he introduced Alex Iwobi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who instantly raised Arsenal’s level. The latter supplied Sead Kolasinac with the pre-assist for the crucial third goal. Both players have been in and out of the side, but Emery, a master of knock-out football, knew exactly how they could wrest back control here.","It is one reason why Emery can legitimately envisage them walking out at the final in Baku on May 29. Arsenal have 18 days off now, which will partly be spent on a warm-weather break in Dubai before the squad splits for international duty. After that, their manager faces the balancing act that will define his first season in north London.","“[There are] exciting moments in front of us,” he said. “A good possibility to do something.”","For the first time in a while it genuinely feels like that for Arsenal; the pressure only gets greater from here, but perhaps at last that finds both team and head coach in their element.",,Notify me of follow-up comments by email.,Notify me of new posts by email.
"On Tuesday the U12 Basketball and Hockey teams travelled to Royal St George’s College to compete in their last game before the New Year. The hockey team was dominant from puck drop until the final whistle. George, Jayin and our four defensemen combined to stymie any offensive threat from the opposition while our forwards held possession of the puck for the majority of the game. Our offense was led by Grade 4 rookie pivot Ben Maharaj who finished with two goals and a beautiful assist for a tap in by Brayden Cox. Great job guys and girls.","The basketball Cubs came out on the first shift not looking their best but for the rest of the game looked strong. Jay Codron led the way with 14 points. Downtown Griffin Brown had an outstanding game with his second game back from injury. Johnny, Daniel, and Fraser were extremely vicious on the boards and combined for 16 rebounds! Ryan and Romeo had a great game and combined for 18 assists. The Cubs 6th shift was probably the strongest shift of the game. Jay Codron and Johnny Musson came out strong and lead the team to a seven-point lead. With Jay’s hoop and one and Johnny’s rebounds the team established a lead that would not be caught. The next shift Ryan and Romeo extended the lead even more to make it good enough for the eighth shift to close the game up. The Cubs this year are looking better than ever! They are 3-0! Let’s go Cubs!","Both teams resume their schedules in the New Year with their participation in the Boyd Caldwell Classic, beginning at the end of our first week back to school.","-Gr.6 student, Jay Codron"

"If there is one thing sports fans love almost as much as watching their favourite team or athlete perform, it is having the chance to recreate their favorite moments in video games. Fans of basketball can play their favorite match ups on NBA 2K and NBA Live.","American football fans have Madden, which is so popular its fall release has become an unofficial holiday. Soccer fans have EA Sports FIFA series to recreate the world’s most popular sport. Yet for the past 7 years boxing fans have been unable to play their beloved sport as EA Sport’s Fight Night series was put on hiatus, reportedly to focus on UFC (the last boxing game created was 2011’s Fight Night Champion). At the time it was believed UFC was more popular, yet in the 7 years since, boxing has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.","Over the past 7 years a new crop of stars has risen to dominate the attention of fans. Fighters like Anthony Joshua, Deontay Wilder, “GGG” Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin, Andre Ward, Vasyl Lomachenko, Tyson Fury, Erislandy Lara, Jermall Charlo, Jermell Charlo, Keith Thurman, Terence Crawford, Canelo Alvarez, Errol Spence Jr, and Mikey Garcia have become household names and brought new fans to the sport. Ironically the UFC’s biggest star Connor McGregor enjoyed his largest payday against boxing’s biggest star Floyd Mayweather Jr (McGregor lost by TKO in the 10th round). As the surging popularity of boxing brought a return to network TV in 2015 and increased shows on cable, the continued absence of boxing from video game developers is a baffling void waiting to be filled.",© Amsay Media ltd 2018-2020 | Contact US- contact@talksports24x7.com
Bob and the Bread Man Exit?,"Sergei Bobrovsky has said he wants to get paid…. The real question is which team is going to pay him? Columbus is pretty tight to the cap, and you have to wonder if they will lose both Artemi Panarin, and Bob both in the summer. Should the Jackets think of moving one or both if they begin to slide in the standings? It’s a tough call, you have to think some teams will come calling, but not many can afford his 7.5-million-dollar cap it.

(yes you read that right). The Canucks are off to a fantastic 9-6 start to the season. A huge part of that has been the play of Rookie Phenom Elias Pettersson. With his 5-point effort last night he is now up to 15 points in his first 9 NHL games. And he missed 6 with a concussion. Brock Boeser scored a pair last night, Pettersson and Brock Boeser look unstoppable on the ice right now, and the hard working, pesky Canucks are learning how to win hockey games, against some good teams too. The Canucks have beat Calgary, Tampa, Pittsburgh, Florida, Boston, Vegas, Minnesota, and now Colorado. And with the likes of; Chris Tanev, Alex Edler, Sven Baertschi, and Brandon Sutter out with injuries it has opened up opportunities for Adam Gaudette, Derrick Pouliot, and Ben Hutton, who are now forced into roles they are not used to being in. The Canucks have injuries, but they are still finding ways to win. With such a weak division, it has some wondering if Pettersson, Boeser, and Bo Horvat can lead the Nucks to a surprise playoff berth in 2018-19.","The @Canucks win 7-6 in OT vs COL, as Elias Pettersson assists on the winner to finish with a 2G-3A night.

I agree 100% with Torts on this one. I too think the NHL has become soft. You can’t make a clean hit anymore without there being a scrum post whistle. The Linesman need to stop being hero’s when it comes to fighting… if two players agree to drop the mits, let them duke it out, why is it that the linesman always jump in? it annoys the shit out of me. For people that think fighting doesn’t belong in the NHL look at the Calgary/Colorado game Thursday night. Av’s defenceman stepped up on Flames forward Mark Jankowski and leveled him with a clean shoulder to shoulder hit, and got 5 and a game for charging, Sam Bennett too matters into his own hands and dropped the glove with Cole, and it pumped the Flames bench up and it was the turning point of the game, as the Flames went on to score 5 goals in the 3rdto win the game 6-5. The NHL is too soft and it is painful to watch at times.",Has the game gone soft?,Not enough hate? @BlueJacketsNHL coach John Tortorella says yes on both counts.

Precourt Sports Ventures wants to build a Major League Soccer stadium on this city-owned tract at McKalla Place. JAY JANNER / American-Statesman,"I know it’s a popular sport to joke about the passionate level of civic engagement at Austin City Hall, especially when ideas get bandied between advisory groups for months on end and City Council meetings run till 3 a.m.","But we should cheer for the smart, inquisitive people who make the time to attend public meetings, read up on various proposals and ask tough questions, especially when taxpayer dollars are on the line. They make our city better.","I was disappointed Thursday evening when Precourt Sports Ventures lobbyist Richard Suttle, speaking to a roomful of people at the Central Library about the possibility of bringing a Major League Soccer franchise to Austin, drew an unfortunate analogy to the city’s reputation for civic engagement.","“Overwhelmingly this is a popular deal,” Suttle said of the MLS proposal, still being negotiated, in which Precourt would pay $1 a year to use city-owned land for a stadium but wouldn’t pay any property taxes on the venue. The franchise promises to provide other perks and regional economic benefits.","“Now, there are some folks that have questions,” Suttle continued. “And in Austin, I tell the story that if we decide we’re going to give out $100 bills on Congress Avenue on Saturday for free, no strings attached, the Anti-$100 Bill Coalition will be formed by tomorrow, and we’ll have discussions on what that would look like.”","Editorial: Negotiate MLS stadium deal on Austin’s terms, not Precourt’s","Some folks in the crowd chuckled. A few people booed. One woman yelled out, “That’s very unfair.” I shared her sentiment.","I’d love to see Austin have its own MLS team, and I see the tremendous potential for it to bring different parts of the city together. But residents are right to ask serious questions about the financial cost to the city, the impact of traffic and parking on the neighbors, and the tradeoffs other cities have experienced when a pro sports team comes to town.",These residents shouldn’t be likened to naysayers who can’t even see the good when it’s raining Benjamins.,"Suttle told the crowd, and later emphasized to me, that wasn’t his intention.","“All I mean by that is that we have a robust city where we like to talk about stuff, and that’s a healthy thing, because we always end up with a better solution when we have everybody in the room, everybody talking,” he told the crowd.","He told me the “Anti-$100 Bill Coalition” was “meant to be the most absurd example” of community feedback, not a commentary on the soccer stadium critics.",Commentary: MLS stadium deal should score points for the community,"In fact, Suttle said he left the meeting with a to-do list based on the concerns residents raised Thursday evening.","“I heard loud and clear that the neighbors that live within a mile of the place, a mile east on Braker (Lane), are concerned about people parking in their neighborhood and walking to the stadium,” Suttle told me. “What that means is I’ve got to go find the model on how they solved that in the neighborhoods near Zilker Park for ACL.” Additionally, Suttle said he recognizes Precourt needs to provide a specific plan for parking. The current site plan has only 1,000 parking spaces for a stadium that will seat 20,000.","He also took note of concerns one resident raised about drainage and water quality, as the McKalla tract is near the headwaters of Little Walnut Creek. One speaker wanted to see more details on the perks for youth soccer; another wanted to see Tejano music incorporated into events at the site; another suggested the deal include a clear cap on the city’s financial contributions to the venture. All duly noted, Suttle said.","The most recurring criticism I heard Thursday evening, though, is that Precourt wouldn’t pay property taxes on the stadium, which would be built by the franchise and then given to the city. One estimate puts the unpaid property taxes at $5 million in the stadium’s first year, including roughly $2.7 million for Austin schools, $1 million for the city of Austin, nearly $850,000 for Travis County, almost $250,000 for Central Health and about $230,000 for Austin Community College.",Kind of the opposite of handing out free $100 bills to the public.,"Precourt is still negotiating other financial terms with the city, with the goal of bringing a proposed deal to the City Council Aug. 9.",But a word of advice: Listen to your critics.

"It is very hard to deny that living the active lifestyle and engaging in sport activities can be tremendously useful for our health. It is also hard to deny that increased physical activity raises the chance of injuries. Fortunately, the pros of the first argument largely outweigh the cons of the latter one, so we should not have any doubts which way to go. However, it does not mean that we should take injuries lightly. If untreated properly, some of them can cause a long-term damage to our bodies. Let us see what those injuries are, and why it is important to leave the treatment to professionals.",Strains and Sprains,"One of the most common types of sport injuries which can occur in almost any kind of physical activity. Strains and sprains occur when a ligament overstretches or even tears. They are most common in wrists, knees, and ankles. The symptoms that point out to them are pain at rest, swelling, redness, bruising, weakness of the muscle, or inability to use the muscle at all. Although they are usually harmless, in some cases they can cause very unpleasant chronic pain, so be sure to ask the physician’s opinion if you experience the symptoms.",Groin Pull,"Groin pull is usually earned by pushing off in a side-to-side motion, which makes it the number one enemy if you are interested in football, hockey, soccer, and baseball. Its symptoms include tenderness and pain in the groin, pain when you raise your knee, pain when you bring your legs together, and finally a snapping feeling during the injury. A groin pull treatment usually includes taking the anti-inflammatory painkillers, like naproxen, so it is strongly advised to ask the doctor’s opinion before getting them. Also, some cases of the pull may require active stretching and strengthening exercises which should not be performed without a proper guidance.",ACL Tear,"This is one of the most severe sport injuries you can get, and the one with the most severe consequences if left untreated. Namely, the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) holds together the leg bone and the knee. If it is strained due to a sudden hit, or a sudden “cut”, it may completely tear, and leave the knee buckling and unstable. Unfortunately, the only way to treat the ACL tear requires surgical assistance. If you hear the dreaded “pop” sound during some sport activity at any time of the day, be sure to immediately contact some reliable 24 hour urgent care center and solve this dangerous issue.",Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome,"Another knee injury, Patellofemoral pain syndrome is caused by excess weight and the knee overuse and results in improper kneecap alignment. It is a common type of injury in basketball, running, and volleyball. You will recognize it by the occasional knee pain (especially when you are sitting, squatting, and going down the stairs), knee buckling, and grinding sensation when you move your knee. Although it can sometimes be tamed with 6 weeks of low impact exercises, some more serious cases may require surgical intervention or wearing a knee brace, so consultations with doctors are well-advised.",Arthritis,"Although it does not exclusively occur as the result of some sport activity, it may happen due to repeated motions like throwing a ball, kneeling, or swinging a bat. Unfortunately, arthritis develops very gradually, so its symptoms can sometimes go unnoticed, but that only underlines the need for seeking the professional advice whenever you feel joint pain and stiffness.","In the end, all we can add is that all the injuries we mentioned above should not, by any mean, discourage you from engaging in physical activity. If anything, sport can only help your body become stronger, healthier and reduce the risk of potential injuries. Caution is always advised no matter what kind of sport you engage in.",,"Gabriella Diesendorf is a freelance writer from Australia and a devoted mother.

"We’ve all matured, and played on a shabby basketball hoop. Throughout play the whole basketball device moves, as a shot strikes the backboard, or a dunk is done. These hoops truly are a danger, with an injury waiting to take place. What happens if overtime, you intelligently conserved up your cash, and bought a hoop that will last a life time? You might need to miss a couple of lunches; however your youngsters will certainly love you. Suppose your youngsters take down the computer game, and began getting outdoors again. The ideal basketball hoop can possibly make this a fact.","Where does one turn to find the best hoop? The market is flooded with manufacturers trying to advertise their item as the very best. You might purchase a basketball objective for under $500, or even under $1000. However, I promise you, that your hoop will certainly not last. Conserve a little bit more loan, and purchase the hoops that are selling for around $2000 bucks.","There are various manners in which a basketball objective is made, and one ought to pay mindful attention to the details. Most goals are made by, having the backboard pivot on a couple of screws. Overtime these can wear down and corrosion.","The bigger producers have addressed this trouble, by sustaining the basketball arm, and backboard, over a more comprehensive area. One excellent layout elevates and lowers telescopically. Since the hoop raises and lowers, up and down, all of the weight gets on the arm, and out a pivot factor. These designs additionally maintain the hoops from leaving into the surface area of play.","Your product will last much longer if the right components are made use of. Utilizing aluminum as opposed to steel increases the stamina of the pole, and is rust evidence. With greater stamina the basketball unit can hold up against a terrific dunk ballgame.","The backboard is a really crucial component. If your child is to find out just how to utilize the glass, then get a hoop that is very similar to gym backboards. Tempered glass backboards are as close as it gets. And any dimension 60 inches wide and 36 inches high will suffice. If the backboard is sustained well, and the glass is thick, after that durability will dominate.","Raising and reducing the device has to be taken into account. Some manufacturer’s do it right, and others make it harder. One basketball system raises and lowers easily in just seven turns. Others you must crank, with a take care of. Whatever the situation might be, take your time in this area in pro-sport-expert. In summary, take your time, discovering the appropriate hoop. Investing a little bit more, might make all the distinction between and life time hoop, and a year’s objective."

"Newest Seahawks Jeron Johnson And Marcel Reece Excited For Opportunity On Tuesday, safety Jeron Johnson and fullback Marcel Reece both signed with the Seahawks. Johnson’s signing adds depth at safety following Earl Thomas’ season ending injury, while Reece gives the Seahawks another option at fullback with Will Tukuafu in the concussion protocol this week. Johnson and Reece were released by teams earlier this year and have been waiting for the right opportunity to present itself ever since, and now both have the chance to contribute to a team that is well positioned to earn a fifth consecutive playoff berth. Johnson took most of his time to strong safety during his first stint with Seattle, but he said he’s ready to play free or strong safety—or anywhere else for that matter. Reece also said he’s ready to go as a seahawks. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll expressed that despite both of them being new to the roster, there’s a level of familiarity with the team and the system that could help them contribute right away. Carroll highly appreciated both new players’ ability of playing football."
"COUVA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO — The U.S. men’s national soccer team is not going to the World Cup next year. Let that sink in for a moment.",A U.S. squad that had qualified for soccer’s global spectacle every four years since last missing out in 1986 will watch the Russian-hosted tournament from home.,All it needed to do was defeat or tie last-place Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday night.,"Instead, the Americans played a shameful first half and lost, 2-1, before a few thousand observers in a lonely little stadium 25 miles from the capital.","Coupled with victories by Panama and Honduras, the Americans (3-4-3) fell to fifth place in the six-team regional competition.","“It’s a blemish for us,” Coach Bruce Arena said. “We should not be staying home for this World Cup.”",[U.S. men’s World Cup failure gets blasted by Taylor Twellman in ESPN rant],"There were several ways for the U.S. team to qualify. The easiest was the simplest: Beat the worst team in the regional competition, an opponent that had won one of its previous nine games, and not have to worry one bit what unfolded in the other two group matches.","But in their most important qualifier in years, with a trip to Russia next summer on the line, the Americans flopped. They conceded an own goal and then a spectacular goal to fall behind 2-0 at halftime. Christian Pulisic, the teenage star, scored less than two minutes after intermission, but Trinidad and Tobago (2-8-0) kept its composure.","“I never thought that I would see this day,” defender Omar Gonzalez said. “It’s the worst day of my career. I am extremely sad right now. What was supposed to be a celebration is now … I don’t know what to say.”",Missing the World Cup seemed nearly impossible in a forgiving CONCACAF region dominated for decades by the United States and Mexico.,Panama (3-3-4) finished third behind Mexico and Costa Rica and qualified for the first time. Honduras (3-3-4) took fourth place and will face Australia in a two-leg playoff next month. (Panama’s superior goal differential edged out Honduras for the automatic berth.),"“It’s a huge disappointment,” U.S. Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati said. “Tonight is for getting over the shock a little bit. In some sense, 2022 starts tomorrow.”","After losing the first two matches in the final round under Jurgen Klinsmann, the Americans seemed back on track with Arena in charge.","A home defeat and away draw last month, however, tossed the campaign into peril. A 4-0 victory over Panama on Friday in Orlando left the Americans well-positioned to seal the berth against a young T&T squad.","If not with a victory, the United States was almost certain to advance with a draw. Or, in the last possible avenue, it could go through if Panama and Honduras stumbled.",The worst-case scenario was realized.,"Troubling signs surfaced right away for the Americans, who played slowly and deliberately, as if they had not fully recovered from Friday’s match.","Trinidad and Tobago moved the ball well, gaining confidence with every touch.","In the 17th minute, Alvin Jones, who plays in the domestic league, swung a cross into the penalty area. Gonzalez was marking Shahdon Winchester in the box and had a beat on the ball. His casual clearing attempt, however, went flying off his left foot and looped over sprawling goalkeeper Tim Howard.","“It was the most unlucky goal ever for myself,” Gonzalez said, “one that will haunt me forever.”","Moments later, Gonzalez was fortunate he wasn’t called for a penalty kick.","Twenty minutes passed, and Jones found himself clear on the right side, some 35 yards from the target. It seemed like the proper moment to serve another dangerous cross. Instead, with no pressure on him or his team, he launched a shot with power and purpose.","Howard soared to his right but couldn’t stop the rocket from settling into the far side. Suddenly, a team with nothing to play for was two goals ahead of a team that had everything at stake.",The only consolation for Arena and Co. was that both Panama and Honduras were losing at home.,"The Americans needed just 80 seconds to halve the deficit as Pulisic collected the ball beyond the top of the penalty area, took on a defender and pumped a 20-yard effort over Adrian Foncette for his ninth international goal in 20 appearances. They were halfway there, another goal from earning the point needed to stay clear of their pursuers.","Trinidad and Tobago was intent on stretching the lead, however. DeAndre Yedlin’s block deep in the box prevented a sure goal and Howard made a one-on-one save on Winchester.","Meantime, Honduras had come from behind to go ahead of Mexico.","In the 69th minute, Foncette made an outstanding save on Dempsey’s one-timer from the top of the box. The tension built to unbearable levels when, in the 77th minute, Clint Dempsey fired a shot off the base of the right post.","In the 88th, Bobby Wood’s header from close range was steered wide by Foncette. Time was running out on the Americans.","Word came from Panama City: Panama had scored. The Americans were about to miss the World Cup. Moments later, they were officially out.","“A lot of things went wrong tonight,” Howard said. “As a program, we have to get better.”",Read more:,Argentina reportedly flew sorcerer to Ecuador ahead of pivotal World Cup qualifier,Brazil fans demand team let Chile win to try to knock Argentina out of World Cup,Cowboys fan suffers third-degree burns putting on flaming Dallas jersey after loss to Packers,ESPN’s Michael Smith will host ‘SportsCenter’ solo during Jemele Hill suspension,The Nationals would have liked to have Stephen Strasburg start Game 4.

Despite a great regular season it wasn't an easy path to the title last night. First they took on last season's champion ""Back That Pass Up"", defeating them in a tight 2-1 game. They followed that up with a thrilling game against ""United"" to decide the league champion, which ended with penalty kicks. Both games were close and hard-fought, but ""Plan B"" stuck it out with a tough defensive game plan. ""Plan B"" finished with an undefeated 8-0-2 record, looking nearly unstoppable. Their +21 goal differential was miles ahead of the competition, showing they were equally great on offense and defense. Their two ties on the season were against their two playoff opponents, but it seems like they learned a thing or two in those regular season games that they were able to use in their playoff victories.

HOME,ABOUT,STAFF,HEADLINES,PODCAST,SOCIAL,CONTACT,More,The latest updates involving the English Premier League.,By Matt Bell,"Updated: Feb. 28, 2019 • 8:19 PM ET",Flickr,Craven Cottage will host a big match in the Premier League this weekend.,"It seems like only yesterday we were celebrating the Christmas fixtures, but the business end of the season is upon us as the latest Premier League season heads into March. As teams in the league have roughly 10 games to go, we’ll soon know whether we’ll have new league champions, the teams that will enjoy European football and the middle of the table, as well as which teams will be promoted to the league next season.",​,"A weekend of derbies is on the horizon, with one taking place on Saturday and two on Sunday. But before we look ahead to this weekend’s fixtures, let’s refresh our memories of what happened in the midweek fixtures.",​,"Chelsea bounced back from the drama against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup on Sunday, as the Blues not only beat Tottenham 2-0, they probably knocked Spurs out the title race once again. With Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino recently stating that it could take 5-10 years for Tottenham to win the league, it wouldn’t be surprising if he accepted another job if an offer came his way this summer.",​,"Meanwhile, Manchester United bounced back from their injury crisis that saw three players subbed in the first 45 minutes against Liverpool on Sunday to beat a recently resurgent Crystal Palace side 3-1. It seems like it’s only a matter of time before caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær gets the job permanently.",You Might Also Like,"Elsewhere, Fulham lost 2-0 to Southampton, a result that cost Claudio Ranieri his job after only 16 games (11 defeats) and lifted Saints out of the relegation zone. Former midfield maestro Scott Parker will take the reins until the end of the season, but it could be too late for the Cottagers to stay up, as they’re 10 points away from safety.",​,​,​,Other results not listed from Week 28,​,Cardiff City 0 | Everton 3,​,Huddersfield Town 1 | Wolverhampton 0,​,Leicester City 2 | Brighton & Hove Albion 1,​,Newcastle United 2 | Burnley 0,​,Arsenal 5 | Bournemouth 1,​,Liverpool 5 | Watford 0,​,Manchester City 1 | West Ham United 0,​,​,,"With three derbies this weekend, there will be plenty of bragging rights up for grabs. Parker has been handed a tough test in his first game as Fulham manager, as he’ll welcome his former club, Chelsea, to Craven Cottage. Fulham needs to start winning games if they want to stay up, and they could take advantage of a currently inconsistent Chelsea side this weekend. Despite the win against Tottenham, plenty of pundits continue to question the safety of Blues manager Maurizio Sarri’s position. Will Fulham shock Chelsea this weekend? We’ll find out on Sunday.","A surprising match to look out for this weekend is West Ham vs. Newcastle, as the fixture has the potential to be a close, fiery encounter. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez was rumored for a move to London Stadium last summer, but instead stayed in the North East.",​,"Despite a shaky start, the Magpies seem to be picking up momentum at the right time. With three wins in their last five matches, Newcastle have well and truly improved and seem to be pulling safely away from the relegation zone. Meanwhile, West Ham’s form continues to be unsettled, with only one win in their last five games. With Argentine star Manuel Lanzini returning from injury, the Hammers hope he can keep them in the top 10.",​,Below are the fixtures that await us this weekend:,​,​,,"Saturday, March 2, 2019",​,Tottenham Hotspur (20-0-8) vs. Arsenal (17-5-6) | 12:30 p.m. BST - 7:30 a.m. ET,​,Manchester United (16-7-5) vs. Southampton (6-9-13) | 3 p.m. BST - 10 a.m. ET,​,Wolverhampton (11-7-10) vs. Cardiff City (7-4-17) | 3 p.m. BST - 10 a.m. ET,​,Bournemouth (10-4-14) vs. Manchester City (22-2-4) | 3 p.m. BST - 10 a.m. ET,​,Burnley (8-6-14) vs. Crystal Palace (8-6-14) | 3 p.m. BST - 10 a.m. ET,​,Brighton & Hove Albion (7-6-14) vs. Huddersfield Town (3-5-20) | 3 p.m. BST - 10 a.m. ET,​,West Ham United (10-6-12) vs. Newcastle United (8-7-13) | 5:30 p.m. BST - 12:30 p.m. ET,​,​,,"Sunday, March 3, 2019",​,Watford (11-7-10) vs. Leicester City (10-5-13) | 12 p.m. BST - 7 a.m. ET,​,Fulham (4-5-19) vs. Chelsea (16-5-6) | 2:05 p.m. BST - 9:05 a.m. ET,​,Everton (10-6-12) vs. Liverpool (21-6-1) | 4:15 p.m. BST - 11:15 a.m. ET,E-mail: mattbell2@mail.com,"© 2019 The Sports Haven, LLC | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | All rights reserved."

The organization entered the SMITE scene in 2012.","SK Gaming was the first major organization to acquire a SMITE team, first acquiring a team in 2012, during the game's closed beta. Accomplishing excellent results in online play, the team was able to continue that success in their first major LAN when they took 2nd at the Gamescom 2013 Invitational, narrowly losing to COGnitive EU 2-1 in a best-of-3 grand finals. In November, the team hit a standstill when team captain, Psiyo, decided to step down from his leadership role.[1] The team decided to leave the organization, and started their own team, Azzur.","In February, the organization decided to pick up TeamQ, consisting of Realzx, CaptainTwig, Badgah, enQu, and prOxyQQ.[2] After qualifying as the 3rd seed from Europe, the team went on to place 4th in the Launch Tournament, as they fell to Team Dignitas in the losers bracket.","After the Launch Tournament, enQu left the team and join Cloud 9, while prOxyQQ wanted to leave the jungle and so left the team to be a free agent. SK filled their open spots with two players who had very minimal competitive experience: Zyrhoes joined as the new jungler, while ManiaKK took over in the solo lane. After a rough regular season, the team was forced into the EU Wildcards, from which they qualified with a first-place finish to the Regional Championship.

"Published April 3, 2017","UB is reducing the number of its intercollegiate athletic programs by four, effective at the end of the spring 2017 season.","Affected teams are men’s baseball, men’s soccer, men’s swimming and diving, and women’s rowing. This brings UB’s total sports sponsorship from 20 to 16 teams.","“This has been a very difficult decision made only with extensive deliberation,” said UB President Satish K. Tripathi. “The unfortunate reality is that we no longer have the resources to support 20 competitive Division I athletic teams. I know that this is a difficult day for our student-athletes, our coaches, and the entire athletics program and university. We will work very hard to provide our student-athletes and coaches who are impacted by this decision with the support they need.”","This decision will better align UB with its Mid-American Conference peers in terms of types and total number of sports teams sponsored by the university. The NCAA requires Division I FBS schools to sponsor a minimum of 16 sports and the Mid-American Conference requires member universities to sponsor football, men’s basketball, women’s basketball, and women’s volleyball.","“As a former student-athlete, I empathize with how difficult this is for our impacted student-athletes. I recognize the strong sense of identity tied to the uniform and the value intercollegiate athletics provides young people,” said Athletics Director Allen Greene.","The reduction in teams followed a comprehensive review and analysis of the athletics department’s budget and programs, and considered rising costs affecting athletics programs nationwide, Greene said.","“We operate in a hypercompetitive environment and are not immune to the financial challenges facing programs at our level,” said Greene. “Regrettably, after exploring many scenarios, the reality is our current path is not sustainable and reductions reluctantly became the only option. While we continue to look for ways to mitigate rising costs, we will roll up our sleeves and enhance our efforts to better educate our community about the importance of ticket sales and philanthropy.”","In its review, the university considered program costs, athletic facilities, Title IX, geographic location and a comparison of sports sponsored by Mid-American Conference schools.",An FAQ about the decision is available here.,"UB will give all affected student-athletes permission to contact any other schools for purposes of transfer. Also, the university will release any national letter of intent signee who decides to pursue other intercollegiate athletic opportunities.",The university will honor all national letters of intent and scholarships of affected student-athletes who want to continue their studies at UB and who remain eligible in accordance with university and athletics department policies.,"After the reduction, the UB athletics department will be composed of these 16 sports: football, softball, women's volleyball, men's and women's basketball, wrestling, women's swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's cross country, women's soccer and men’s and women’s track and field (indoor and outdoor).",UB student-athletes have surpassed the 3.0 combined GPA mark for 10 straight semesters. UB has won five conference championships and one national championship over the past four years.,"Maintaining high academic standards, providing students with an excellent athletic experience and competing for conference championships remain the primary goals of the UB athletics department, Greene said.","“The University at Buffalo is committed to Division I athletics and remaining competitive in the Mid-American Conference,” Tripathi said.","Can you please explain what exactly do you mean by ""We will work very hard to provide the athletes and coaches with the support they need?"" How are you going to quantify that UB worked very hard to help those affected?",,Anish Antony,"I am also for Division I athletics, however when it comes to football, it is a ""cash-draining cow."" UB will never get the community (fans) and student support required to fill the seats (generate revenue) in any football stadium. The reality for UB is Give UP Football!! By the way, I love college football. I live in the USC, UCLA area; our daughter graduated from the University of Arizona.",,Maris Janson,"I support the decision to cut the number of UB teams from 20 to 16. UB needs to save money so that it can afford to support the university's primary academic goals such as research and teaching. From what I heard, the university is going to save around $2 million by getting rid of these four teams.",,Brian McAvoy,"Read this story with great interest. The West Coast Conference members eliminated football one by one over the years. Only the University of San Diego plays today. It's an easier way to balance Title IX compliance and fiscal impact for athletic departments, and invest more in other sports, like basketball, that can achieve more with less. Tough decisions.",,Michael Johnson,"Sounds like this decision was made thoughtfully. I hope all affected student-athletes choose to remain and study at UB. As an alumna, I'm sure they will have the same satisfaction and success as I have had.",,Lauren Clifford,I fully understand the money-saving motive UB is going for by cutting sports teams; however I believe the wrong teams were cut.,,"The football team should no longer be supported by UB Athletics and already has no support from the students/Buffalo region. The MAC conference forces UB to keep the football team in order to compete, which is a shame.",,I would've loved to see UB drop football and put the money toward sports like basketball and soccer.,,Joshua Grazen,"UB was heartless in the timing of this decision. If they had informed these athletes earlier in the season, many could have reached out to other universities in order to continue their athletic careers.",,"Shame on the president for his supposed ""support."" True support would have been to give adequate notice to these athletes instead of leaving them heartbroken.",,The negative impact this will have on the university will last for years.,,Susan Butler,"Department of Oral Biology University at Buffalo 135 Foster Hall Buffalo, NY 14214 Phone: (716) 829-2844 Fax: (716) 829-3942","Department Chair Frank Scannapieco, DMD, PhD fas1@buffalo.edu","Assistant to the Chair Kurt Winter, PhD kwinter@buffalo.edu","Squire Hall University at Buffalo, South Campus Buffalo, NY 14215"

Home > Columns > In A Devilish Mood: The topic of sport specialization – is it good or bad?,I want to start with this disclaimer – “This is my opinion.”,"I say this because everybody has a different opinion on when and whether kids should focus all their attention on one sport. I feel playing multiple sports as a youth can do nothing but help you excel as an athlete. When I was younger, it was the norm for kids to play multiple sports as they grew up and all sports had different seasons which made it easy for kids to do so. I grew up playing baseball in the summer and hockey in the winter. I tried basketball and football and quickly learned that those two sports were not for me.",READ OUR DECEMBER 2017 ISSUE,"Nowadays, either you have coaches preaching to parents that if their son or daughter wants to get a college scholarship or play professionally, they need to play that one sport all year long or you just have parents that believe that is what is best in order for their child to reach the top levels.","First off, I could not disagree more with that theory and we have to look at what is driving this belief – MONEY. The amount of money these professional athletes are making these days is absolutely life-changing, not only for the athlete, but for the athlete’s family’s future. Having your child sign a professional contract is like hitting the lottery, but I might also add that the odds of either of those two things happening are similar.",The bottom line is that the cream usually rises to the top and the young adults who make it to the college or pro levels are usually the best athletes. Becoming a good athlete involves taking a stab at multiple sports. There is also a lot more than just talent that is required to play at the higher levels.,"Sports at the higher levels are a thinking person’s game and while some kids may excel at two sports, they may have a better mind for one of them. If talent were the only criteria, we would know going in who was going to win the championships. A team that believes they can win and outworks their opponent can beat a higher talented team on any given night. The No. 1 trait of a professional athlete is work ethic and the belief that they can achieve anything they want as long as they work hard enough.","This is rare to find in children these days and that is exactly the purpose for youth sports. If we can help instill this attitude in your child then we, as coaches and programs, are doing a great job. The numbers show that the vast majority of our children will not be playing sports for a living. However, if their coaches have instilled in them this lesson, then they have a great chance at excelling at whatever it is they decide to do for a living.","Attitude is everything and it is one thing if a kid just loves that sport so much that he wants to play all the time and completely different thing if the kid is playing one sport around the clock because their parents are pushing them to do so. Either way, kids need to take a break from any one sport and explore other sports or hobbies throughout the year. I believe that the body and mind both need a break from one activity.","The bottom line is that growing up should be the best years of your life and that is all about having fun! The experiences our children have as young athletes are going to be cherished for the rest of their lives and it is my belief that we, as parents, should encourage them to try as many different sports/activities as they can while they are young.",That’s just my two cents.,Brad McCaughey is the director of hockey operations and coach-in-chief for DYHA.,"(Jan. 12, 2018)",,,,"© 2017 Mackinder Media, LLC.

As of December 2018 the Casino Reinvestment Authority (CRDA) will be receiving an income boost thanks to New Jersey’s recently legalised sports betting.,"The New Jersey Governor, Phil Murphy, has just approved a bill that will direct 1.25% of sports betting revenue to the authority. The funds will be used to finance both public and private projects within the NJ state and will be managed by the CRDA.","In June of this year, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) which made sports betting illegal was withdrawn by the Supreme Court. The PASPA withdrawal resulted in individual states being allowed to decide on and enforce their own regulations regarding sports wagering.","New Jersey decided to regulate its market in June and it has already generated $16.5 million in the state. Under the new bill, 1.25% of this and future revenue will belong to the CRDA.","Founded in 1984 the CRDA has spent over $2 billion on projects in New Jersey. The organization used to receive some of its funding from the casino industry, however in 2006 these funds were redirected to help pay Atlantic City Debt. This resulted in an almost $22 million loss in revenue for the CRDA.","The CRDA’s purpose is to reinvest casino investment alternative tax into the state with a focus on positive improvement for the residents of Atlantic City. In addition to the 1500 houses the organization has built, it has invested in over 400 projects to improve the culture and social landscape of the state.",The new bill will allow the CRDA to continue to work toward and contribute to improving the lives of state residents.,The NJDE or New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement’s director David Rebuck has shared his excitement at the revenue reported to date. He believes that the September figures will be outstanding due to the start of the NFL season. Rebuck shared his enthusiasm with delegates attending the G2E Expo in Las Vegas this week.,"According to the August report released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming, Total Gaming Revenue increased by 24% when compared to the same period in 2017.

""I just support Real Madrid. I have a lot of friends that are from Atletico. They are playing in a competition in Europe against an English team. I just went there to support Atletico Madrid. They invited me. I just wanted to enjoy the day, to see a great football match.""","Nadal was captured on camera with the jersey around his neck during the team's 1-0 win at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium on Thursday, a result that allowed Atletico to reach the final of Europe's second-tiered club competition.","""The (club's) president gave me a T-shirt as a gift,"" Nadal said. ""At night it was a little bit chilly, a little bit cold, and I just used it as a scarf. That's all. But it's always the same stuff. Maybe there's too much hypocrisy, or I would say you people in the media have to write too many things, so you have to explore some stupid things.""","Nadal also discussed Sunday's ""clasico"" between Barcelona and Real Madrid, which ended in a 2-2 draw after several questionable calls made by the officiating crew at Camp Nou Stadium.","""I don't have to talk about football referees,"" Nadal said. ""The poor referee will have a lot on his back because you have been speaking about them for hours and hours. I'm not going to contribute to that show. I think it was a great football match, nice to see. I really enjoyed the football.""",Nadal said he favors after-game sanctions to try to make the referees' life easier.,"""Maybe I am very passionate about football, and I'm not criticizing football,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, the referees have a very hard job. It's very difficult to make decisions when you are under pressure. There are sometimes many players that try to trick other players ... It's just a show.""","Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."

Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv vs Anadolu Efes Istanbul (19:05 GMT on Thursday)Anadolu Efes could clinch a play-off ticket if they beat Maccabi Tel Aviv but the hosts are also determined to pick up this win for a chance to barge into the play-offs zone. Efes (16-9) are currently ranked fourth in the team standings. They walloped Barcelona Lassa 92-70 at home last week. They have won three of their last four games in this competition but have dropped their last three games on the road. The spotlight is on Shane Larkin, who erupted for a career-high 37 points against Barcelona that earned him Round 25 MVP honours. Adrien Moerman is also out to impress after posting 22 points and 10 rebounds in their last Euroleague outing. Larkin and Moerman are expected to get support from Rodrigue Beaubois, Vasilje Micic, Krunoslav Simon and Tibor Pleiss. Maccabi (12-13), meanwhile, are currently ranked ninth in the table. The Israeli champions are coming off a 77-70 win at Bayern Munich in the previous round. It was their second straight win in this competition. Scottie Wilbekin is Maccabi’s top gun while big men Tarik Black and Johnny O'Bryant are also expected to make an impact. Head coach Ioannis Sfairopoulos will also count on Michael Roll, DeAndre Kane and Alex Tyus. Efes beat Maccabi 90-77 in Istanbul last November 20 with Pleiss and Bryant Dunston leading the way with 14 points apiece.

Both teams sport 13-12 records and are locked in a tight battle with other teams for the lower play-off seedings. Milano suffered a 101-95 loss at CSKA Moscow last week that ended their five-game winning run in this competition. Euroleague top scorer Mike James is hoping to do better against Olympiacos after being held to 13 points against CSKA. Expected to back him up in the scoring chores are James Nunnally, Vladimir Micov and Nemanja Nedovic. Olympiacos, meanwhile, posted an 89-76 win at Buducnost last week to halt a five-game skid in this competition. Georgios Printezis and Vassilis Spanoulis are the one-two punch of the Reds with support expected to come from Nigel Williams-Goss, Zach LeDay and Nikola Milutinov, who had 15 points and 12 rebounds against Buducnost. Milano handed Olympiacos an embarrassing 99-75 beating in Greece last October 19. James led the onslaught with 22 points while Nedovic scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half. We are backing Milano to win this duel.Point Spread Milano -3 -110£100: Up to £100 Bet CreditsNew Customers only. Up to £100 in Bet Credits.

L-R Highlights 10-1-16 Oct 1, 2016","C-N Football: Ken Sparks recap L-R 10-1-16 Oct 1, 2016",VIDEO: Ken Sparks Interview,VIDEO: Lane Bloom Interview,VIDEO: Montel Presley Interview,VIDEO: Highlights,"JEFFERSON CITY, Tenn. – Lenoir-Rhyne (2-3, 2-0 South Atlantic Conference) held Carson-Newman (2-3, 1-2 SAC) to its lowest offensive output of the season and used a last-minute field goal to power through to a fifth straight win over Carson-Newman.",L-R placekicker Hunter Haire connected on a 35-yard field goal with 59 seconds remaining to cement a quintet of consecutive wins for the Bears over the Eagles. L-R becomes the first team ever to beat Carson-Newman on five consecutive occasions in Ken Sparks' tenure as head coach.,It marks the first time a team has beaten the Eagles five times in a row since Elon won seven straight against the Eagles from 1972-78.,Carson-Newman was averaging 560 yards of total offense entering the game. The Eagles' offense sputtered to a season-low 250 yards of offense. The Eagles have five halves of football this season where they gained more yards than they did in the entirety of Saturday's game.,"""This was a lost opportunity,"" Carson-Newman head football coach Ken Sparks said. ""We had so many opportunities to make things happen and to make plays that would make a difference. We had a hard time getting all three phases of the game working together. We wound up shooting ourselves in the foot a lot tonight. Our guys gave great effort today. There were so many times where if we would have executed a little bit better, we could have had some big plays.""","L-R wasn't spectacular offensively, but the Bears made plays when they had to. The Bears only gained 294 yards of total offense, 113 of which came in the first 15 minutes of the game.",Redshirt freshman running back Nelson Brown was the bell cow for the Bears. The tailback rushed 35 times for an even 200 yards. Brown's 35 carries are the second most all-time by a Carson-Newman opponent.,"The Eagles were led offensively by Antonio Wimbush (Kingsland, Ga.) and his 99 yards rushing on 11 carries. Jamal Jones (Chattanooga, Tenn.) had 56 yards on nine carries and a score.","C-N Football: Montel Presley recaps L-R 10-1-16 Oct 1, 2016","Carson-Newman's defense made 10 stops behind the line of scrimmage. Phalen Booker's (Waveland, Miss.) made three stops behind the line of scrimmage. Lane Bloom (Knoxville, Tenn.) matched a career high with 13 stops. Montel Presley (Miami, Fla.) and Sha'Heem Stupart (Taylors, S.C.) each had 11. Bloom also made 2.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage.",Presley's 11 stops are a career high for the freshman and the most by a C-N defensive lineman since Jarod Henderson had 11 against the Bears in the NCAA playoffs in 2013.,"Travis Head led the Bears defense with seven tackles and a sack. Sherrod Williams had six tackles, a fumble recovery and an interception.","C-N Football: Lane Bloom recaps L-R 10-1-16 Oct 1, 2016","Carson-Newman started slow. The Eagles fumbled away their first possession, giving L-R the football inside the C-N five. Three plays later, Robbie Hicks plunged in on a two-yard play off tackle to give the Bears a 7-0 lead with 8:21 left in the first.","After a C-N three-and-out, the Bears marched down the field in 13 plays, covering 82 yards. Nelson Brown powered into the end zone on an eight yard run up the gut to put L-R ahead by two scores.",C-N finally got its offense in gear on the next drive. C-N methodically moved down the field in 12 plays before Jones finally burst through a hole on the left side of the line on a draw play to score from 27 yards out with 10:58 left in the second.,"Defenses dominated for the remainder of the half, with neither side getting inside the other's 40. However, the bigger blow came when Carson-Newman's starting quarterback Noah Suber (Asheville, Tenn.) was sidelined with an injury on the second to last series of the half.","Derrick Evans (Macon, Ga.) took over at quarterback and moved the Eagles near midfield on the final possession of the first half before time ran out.",L-R would get on the board first in the second half with a Haire field goal from 31 yards away. The kick with 8:42 left in the third pushed the Bears' lead back to two scores 17-7.,"The Eagles would rely on opportunism to make headway into the lead. A Wimbush 38-yard punt return gave C-N a 21-yard field late in the third. Three plays later, Evans rode a QB sneak two yards into the end zone to bring the Eagles within a field goal.","Another bit of sudden change went the Eagles' way in the fourth. Stupart knocked a fumble free and Braxton Butler pounced on the loose pig skin to give the Eagles' the ball at the L-R 32. Five plays later, C-N's drive sputtered and Jonathan King (Knoxville, Tenn.) was able to drive home a 37-yard field goal, tying things at 17 with 7:36 to play.",The team's swapped punts before the Bears won a battle of field position to set up for Haire's game-winner.,"Carson-Newman had a last-gasp drive, but Evans hurled an interception that sealed the game for the Bears.","C-N returns to action Saturday at Brevard.

"Baker Mayfield and Patrick Mahomes traded blows in a record-setting game in 2016, in which the two QBs combined for 1,383 passing and rushing yards. (0:59)","For the first time as pros, Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield will square off Sunday when Kansas City travels to Cleveland.","Yet two years before they began lighting up the NFL, the two young quarterback stars lit up the scoreboard in a college football shootout for the ages.","Even to those who were there that night in Lubbock to watch Oklahoma outscore Texas Tech 66-59, the record-breaking numbers remain almost unfathomable to contemplate.","The two sides combined for an FBS-record 1,708 yards of offense. Mahomes set FBS records with 819 yards of total offense and 734 passing yards.",Mayfield broke an OU record with seven touchdown passes.,"And together, Mahomes and Mayfield combined for 1,279 passing yards -- the most ever in a college football game.","Looking back, Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury and OU coach Lincoln Riley, who was then the Sooners' offensive coordinator, had the same single word to describe the game.","""Epic.""","""That night, those two did it as good as you could ever do it in college,"" said Kingsbury, whose Red Raiders coincidentally host the Sooners again this weekend in a key Big 12 matchup. ""I've never seen two guys do it better on the same field.","""They were both on fire.""",Other compelling storylines only added to the drama.,"Mayfield, who had transferred from Texas Tech and had actually hosted Mahomes on his official recruiting visit, was back in Lubbock for the first time as Oklahoma's quarterback.",Mahomes was battling through a sprain to his throwing shoulder and fracture to his left wrist.,"But neither injuries nor the Oklahoma defense could slow Mahomes, who finished with 88 passing attempts. And despite the hostile Tech crowd, Mayfield would not be stopped either, with 545 yards through the air.","""I definitely felt we were watching two guys that would be playing on Sunday,"" said Bob Stoops, then Oklahoma's coach. ""Absolutely.""","As the schools prepare to meet each other again, ESPN recounted that epic Mahomes-Mayfield shootout through more than 20 interviews of people who were there to witness it.","Lincoln Riley: Our kids were really fired up for the game, not just Baker. It was a fun atmosphere, a hostile crowd. All the history of Baker, all the history with our staff, I mean our players talked about that through the week. So we were motivated.","Jessica Coody, Sooner Sports TV: Walking to the stadium, all the fraternity houses had these signs, all these negative comments toward Baker. I was thinking, do you people understand when you make him mad, he plays better? Then when you get in there, it's all these ""Traitor"" T-shirts.",Seen a few of these shirts in the Texas Tech student section: pic.twitter.com/K0g5eCBHsx,"Chris Plank, OU radio sideline reporter: I'll never forget the pregame energy. You had a group of fans who just so badly wanted to give it to somebody. They were ready to let him have it.","Chris Level, Tech sideline reporter: He was public enemy No. 1. Baker had played up to that, embraced the heel role. There were signs everywhere. As much as you were going to go cheer for Tech, you were going to cheer against Mayfield. The students were chanting, ""F--- you, Baker.""","Mayfield: That was my ""Welcome back to Lubbock"" moment.","Toby Rowland, OU play-by-play voice: There was a lot of venom. There was a lot of excitement on Baker's part. He knew how he was going to be greeted and he loved walking into the lion's den.",Stoops: The only talk I ever had with Baker leading up to the game was just don't try and make this personal or don't make too much of this. You're too good of a player.,"Riley: He wants the crowd to chant at him. He feeds off of that. He fed off it in the right way, stayed focused, stayed locked in.",Mayfield (in 2016): That's exactly how I thought it was going to be and I enjoyed it.,"Keke Coutee, Tech receiver: I knew the game was going to be a barn burner, because Baker had a lot to prove leaving Tech. Then Pat was such a competitor. Guy's a baller.","Drew Krueger, Tech trainer: Pat injured the shoulder against Kansas [three weeks before]. It was a significant shoulder separation. Those are very painful for any type of movement, not to mention throwing the football. He played against Kansas State, and then on the last play, he fell on it again. So it was real sore and we were all kind of unsure what to expect.","Kingsbury: He had been limited in practice. They had to numb his shoulder before the game, and then he broke his [non-throwing] wrist in the first half. Nobody knew it. He just kept playing and ended up having to get surgery after the season, before the combine and bowl prep.",Krueger: He just asked us to tape it up.,"Brian Jensen, Tech play-by-play voice: [Level] kept telling us you could see it in his face, the pain he was in. He was fighting through it all.",Level: Just a total warrior.,"Obo Okoronkwo, OU linebacker: Patrick had the juice the whole game. He didn't get tired. Like, he never looked tired the whole game.","Kingsbury: He was so locked into the zone, and they had the same thing going on.","Both offenses were loaded beyond just the quarterbacks. Along with Mayfield, OU wideout Dede Westbrook was a Heisman finalist that season, and left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. and tight end Mark Andrews would become unanimous All-Americans the following year. Joe Mixon is now the starting running back for the Cincinnati Bengals, and on the Tech side, Keke Coutee would go on to become a starting receiver for the Houston Texans.",Mahomes: They had a ton of talent. We had a ton of talent.,"Rick Trice, Tech statistician: We're used to having a lot of offensive numbers here, but we were not prepared for the way that game would play out.","Kingsbury: I think there was anticipation there could be some fireworks. ... Look at some of players you had in that game. You look at Baker and Joe Mixon, Dede Westbrook lighting it up. Plus the big tight end [Andrews] that's at Baltimore. And then we had Pat and Keke Coutee on our side going up and down the field, spectacular players. And then two quarterbacks, Baker obviously with the history here. He was on a mission, and then Pat was on a mission of not letting him get one here.","Riley: Most of our stuff was on schedule. Mahomes was a little different. ... making so many unconventional plays, so many plays off script, coming out of rushes, big scrambles, throwing going sideways. He just made some unbelievable plays. And that kept them in it. You knew you were watching something pretty special with the way those two guys were playing.","Stoops: I vividly remember us a couple of times having our hands on Patrick, really feeling that hey, we finally got a sack. A chance to turn it for us. And he would pull out of it somehow, escape the sack and fight his way out of it.","Okoronkwo: We had him in our hands at least 10 times and he just kept slipping out of there, like he was greased up or something. There were a lot of times I was pursuing him where I thought I was going to get him and I didn't. We couldn't stop him.","Teddy Lehman, OU color analyst: Mahomes' performance was maybe more impressive than Baker's in a sense, because he was scrambling for his life. And I hadn't seen another player we've played that was throwing guys open. He would scramble and just throw it to a spot and his receivers would make adjustments to come back to the ball.","In addition to the quarterbacks, multiple players in this game would put up monster numbers. The Red Raiders would nearly have three different receivers go over 100 yards in Coutee (172), Jonathan Giles (167) and Cameron Batson (99). The Sooners, meanwhile, would become the first team in FBS history to boast a 500-yard passer, a 200-yard receiver (Westbrook) and a 200-yard rusher (Mixon), who would become the first player in OU history to finish with 200 yards rushing and 100 receiving in the same game.","Riley: Joe Mixon had a touchdown run called back for a holding penalty. It still, to this day, might be the best run I've ever seen in college football. He just kind of wiggled his way, reversed field, ended up breaking several tackles. He caught a ball one-handed up the right sideline for a touchdown. He was fabulous that night, one of the best individual running back performances I've ever seen.","Jensen: The guy that really killed us was Mixon. Granted, Mayfield threw well, he had seven touchdown passes, but Mixon would be wide open, break a tackle and be gone.","Level: We still talk about this game quite a bit. For OU, it was the Joe Mixon/Dede Westbrook show.","Jah'Shawn Johnson, Tech safety: Those skill guys they had were tremendous. Baker did a great job buying time and putting it on the money all night.","How much offense was there in Lubbock, Texas, on Oct. 22, 2016? More than double the average total offense and nearly triple the passing yardage of the average NFL game last season.","Four minutes in, it looked as if OU was on its way to a rout. Giles fumbled the ball away on Tech's first possession, and Mayfield hit Westbrook for the Sooners' second touchdown. Then Mahomes faced third-and-long from deep in his own territory.","Riley: Baker probably wanted to win that game as much or more than any we ever played here. I knew he was really, really locked in. He threw two early touchdown passes that I think kind of settled him in.",Mayfield (in 2016): I let them know very quickly we were not going to flinch.,"Jensen: Pat had a third-and-10 from his own 16. And here comes Pat with a pass to Cameron Batson [for 31 yards]. Just suddenly you could see it in his demeanor, the team's demeanor -- ""OK, here we go.""","Level: Kliff decided to say screw it, we're just not going to run the ball.","Riley: It was frustrating because we got to a number of third downs and could not get them off the field, and Mahomes was such a big reason why.","Mayfield, remembering the game this week: They were 20-of-25 on third downs.","Jensen: Every time Pat would put a drive together, they'd get a gut punch a couple of plays later from Oklahoma. Oklahoma scored so fast on their drives, they weren't really even drives. And then Pat would have to put together something to come back. It was just ridiculous that he kept coming up with another play.",Riley: We hit so many big plays offensively that our play numbers weren't just incredibly high.,Kingsbury: We had the lead and they hit a long pass right before halftime to take it back. I knew it was going to take 60 points to win this thing.,"Johnson: It was very frustrating. All we needed was one stop, the way our offense was rolling. But they weren't going to be stopped.","Orlando Brown Jr.: I don't mean to talk bad about Tech, but they didn't have a lot of talent defensively. Our mentality was score as much as we can.","Both offenses were hot in the first half. In the second, they were completely unstoppable. After Tech punted to open the third quarter, the two teams scored touchdowns on every drive the rest of the game for a total of 10.","Mayfield (that night): I told some of the guys at halftime, ""If you're scared and you don't want to score every drive, then stay in here.""",Riley: I honestly think people couldn't really believe what they were seeing.,"Trice: In the third quarter, I started really keeping track of the total offense for both teams and looking at it constantly and actually updating the media relations department because I felt we were probably creeping up on NCAA records.","Kingsbury: I've never seen anything like it. Pat was phenomenal, and [Mayfield was] on the other side. I don't know if the ball touched the ground for them the entire night.","Johnson: Those guys were going at it, making plays left and right. It wasn't pleasant for the defenses.",Andrews: Our fullback Dimitri Flowers ran an out route and turned it up. Baker started scrambling around and found him in the back of the end zone [for a 34-yard touchdown late in the third quarter]. It was such an incredible catch. One of those things that you don't see very often.,Lehman: A crowd gets into a game whenever the defense is trying to get a big stop. But there were basically never any. So there were never these moments where the crowd got really loud. It was the weirdest thing.,"Creighton DeKalb, OU band (drums): The ""Boomer Sooner"" count actually wasn't abnormally high. We play Boomer between plays to encourage the team. But the offense scored so fast, we really only got to play it after touchdowns.",Lehman: There was a lot of standing around waiting for kickoffs to happen.,Level: It was like pingpong. I don't know if Oklahoma was ever in danger of losing that game. But Pat kept slinging it. He would not go away.,"Trice: You knew in the second half that if either team made a hiccup, had a turnover, had to punt, whatever, it was going to cost them the game.","Andrews: Greatest game I've ever been a part of. Two great, prolific offenses going after it. Everybody knew that we were going to score. The whole time the feeling was the last team with the ball was going to win.","Turned out, that would be the case. But not before an array of spectacular fourth-quarter plays -- some of which the Red Raiders had to devise from scratch.",Kingsbury: You just run out of plays. When you're calling that many plays -- and that many pass plays -- you're drawing stuff up in the dirt and trying to get people open at the end of it.,"Mahomes: With Coach King, we always had plays left in the tank.","Kingsbury: I just remember asking Pat on the sideline, ""Hey, would this work because I don't have much left on the sheet? So what do you think?"" And he usually had good answers. We'd come up with something, and no matter what we called that night, he was gonna make it work.","Stoops: Coach Riley came up to me at a certain point -- I want to say early in the fourth quarter -- and asked me did I want him to burn the clock. I said, ""Listen man, we need to score. We're not making enough plays [on defense], and [Mahomes] is hot and we got Baker."" They weren't stopping us, so I said, ""Look, you just do what you got to do to score and don't worry about the clock.""","Kingsbury: Pat threw a pass falling off his back foot. The ball probably went 60 yards to Keke with a rusher barreling down right in his face. I didn't think he'd ever get it there, and he hit him in stride. One of the more impressive throws I've ever seen.",Mayfield: He does stuff that you can't even think of being possible.,"Jensen: ""Can you believe he just did that?"" I must have said that a thousand times in his career, but during this game in particular.","Coutee: It went quick, but at that point I thought we were actually going to win.",Stoops: Wild. Wild the entire day.,"Jensen: My voice was terrible. It was raspy and weak and I was drinking everything I could get my hands on in the booth. Water and Diet Cokes. I stuck in ice, doing everything I could do just to keep it going.","Mahomes: I think baseball had me prepared from being a pitcher. I didn't know I had thrown that many times. I remember one of my buddies [receiver Hunter Rittimann] came up to me before the last drive and was like, ""You have 77 pass attempts right now,"" and I was like, ""Man, that's a lot of passes.""","Chad Harberson, Tech push-up guy, tasked with doing one to match the Red Raiders' score after each touchdown or field goal: It was insane. We were dead there at the end. Those guys holding up the pushup board, they were exhausted. We were dreading that next set we would've had to do if Tech had tied it up at the end. But it would've been well worth it.","After cutting OU's lead to 66-59 with 1:38 to go on a 3-yard touchdown pass to Batson, Mahomes wouldn't touch the ball again.","Riley: The last play of the game, other than when we kneeled it, we had a third-and-short, had to get a first down. We were up seven, had to get a first down or we'd give them the ball back and certainly didn't want to do that.","Andrews: It was complete exhaustion. There were so many plays, so many catches, so many everything.","Riley: You're just kinda like, ""Wow, that was a marathon.""",Trice: The craziest thing about the game is that both teams had exactly the same number of yards [854]. I don't even know how that happens.,"Kingsbury: I was actually walking to the locker room and SportsCenter was already playing it. I saw the yardage and the numbers and I'm like, ""Wow."" To have both those guys play the way they did. ... We'll never see it again, I don't think.","Riley: For so many years [as a Tech assistant under Mike Leach], I walked up the other tunnel after the game. The first time being on that side of it was kind of an eerie feeling. I was just finally taking it all in, what really just happened, being able to be a part of those two offenses and their historic performances.","Covering the game that night at Jones Stadium for ESPN, I was in the visitors tunnel afterward. Mayfield stopped by to casually rehash the game, asking what records Mahomes had broken. Like most everyone else, he too had been blown away with Mahomes' performance.",Jensen: It was the game that really stamped in our mind how great Mahomes was and was gonna be. There were so many times he could have faltered in that game and he never did. I'll never forget how impressive he was in that game.,Coutee: What he was able to do that night was remarkable.,"Krueger: He is probably the toughest athlete I've gotten a chance to work with that closely. I think we were just amazed at what he was doing after all his injuries, because he really rose his level of play after a couple of bad weeks dealing with the shoulder. He was unstoppable.",Kingsbury: He was going to try and will that game no matter what. I wish we could've won the game for him because he deserved that.,"Mahomes: It was a game where there were a lot of talented people on the field, one of those Big 12 shootouts. I wish we would have won, but it was just awesome to be a part of it.",Riley: I've always had a lot of confidence in Baker and his ability. I always thought he would have a chance to be an excellent pro. I left that night feeling the same way about Mahomes.,"Plank: Everyone that left that stadium that night, even if they were the most die-hard haters of Baker Mayfield, couldn't help but come away impressed with what they witnessed.",Johnson: That's why Baker went No. 1. He protects the ball very well and gets the ball to his playmakers. That's why Pat went top 10 as well. He extends plays with his feet and can make any throw.,"Mayfield: Talent-wise, I thought he should've been [a No. 1 pick, too, in 2016]. I love Myles [Garrett, Mayfield's Cleveland teammate, a defensive end out of Texas A&M who was actually the No. 1 pick that year]. Coming from the Texas Tech system, there are always your skeptics about people doubting the fact that all he did was sit back there and throw the ball. He threw it 88 times in our game, but when it comes down to it, throwing the ball is throwing the ball, and he is really good at it.","Immediately afterward, part of the focus nationally was on the defenses, instead of the incredible offenses. But as Mahomes and Mayfield have gone on to NFL stardom, the 2016 OU-Tech game has come to be appreciated for what it truly was -- a quarterbacking classic.","Rowland: When I was calling it, I was thinking in my head, ""We're seeing the most amazing college football game of all time. These two teams are just trading haymakers."" Then as soon as you get on social media, the outcry of anger that people who watched it, they didn't feel that way. They were mad because the defense was so poor.","Lehman: I've never seen a locker room where it honestly looked like half of the guys won the Super Bowl and half of the guys, like, lost to Rutgers.","Okoronkwo: It felt like we lost. Yeah, we won the game, but we gave up [854] yards. It was quiet, we didn't say nothing on the bus ride home. We were ashamed. Everybody was laughing at us. I looked at my Twitter, and I just deleted the app off there because all our fans were disgusted with us.",Riley: It wouldn't have mattered that night really what defense was out there. I think a lot of people that saw the numbers and the score after the game and didn't watch it missed out. It was a great college football game.,Kingsbury: It was just the perfect storm for that type of offensive output. I remember afterward thinking that I was really fortunate to be able to work with both those guys at one point because it was the highest level of quarterback play I've ever seen in college going at each other. A surreal experience for me.,"Mayfield: Weird things happen in Lubbock, Texas, on Saturday nights.","Riley: I've seen a lot of good offensive performances over the years, and the way those two quarterbacks played that night, they'd score on anybody. The people there that saw it, they ought to consider themselves lucky. Because chances are, they'll never see anything like it again.","ESPN's Lindsey Thiry, Jamison Hensley, Sarah Barshop and Adam Teicher contributed to this report.","To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?"

Black squirrels once were common in America before European migration,"Peering out the front window with my first cup of coffee this morning, I was rewarded with the sight of at least a half dozen squirrels cavorting on my snow-covered lawn, running up and down the trees, chasing each other and creating a maelstrom of snow powder and furry activity. One of the frisking rascals, I noticed with surprise, was melanistic, a black phase of our common gray squirrel. Though fairly rare (one in 10,000) these days, the jet-black variety is a handsome mutation and jogged some interesting facts loose in my memory. Winter storm warnings of about two inches of snow had been choking the airwaves. Despite having been born and raised around the snow-bound Great Lakes and immunized to such hysterics, I did begin to feel concern for the neighborhood critters. Which is why I had piled an ample supply of corn and seeds under the sheltering hull of my trailered skiff for the squirrels and birds. This, of course, made my yard quite a gathering place for local wildlife, including the black squirrel (which, I later found, regularly lives about a block away). Black squirrels, I also discovered, were much more common in America and perhaps even dominant in many large areas before Europeans began migrating to North America. Heavily forested with mature hardwoods, the dense canopy of the pre-settlement forests was not readily penetrated by sunlight. Dim light provided an advantage to the darker coloration of the melanistic squirrel variety. They were not as visible as the grays were to the many owls and hawks that were their principle predators. Agricultural, however, soon changed that. Clearing the forests to provide for shelter, fuel, farming and livestock likely left the darker-colored squirrels more visible in the now semi-forested areas. Since black offspring are common only when both parent squirrels are black (the black gene being recessive), the black variant began to give way to the gray as the dominant squirrel variety. Today the gray is far more common throughout their ranges. But exceptions remain. When I arrived in this area to work for the Department of Agriculture, I lived in Washington, D.C., where I was surprised to note a large number of black squirrels in the parks surrounding DuPont Circle and the Executive Office Building grounds. I distinctly recall one female, quite friendly, that lived near my apartment and sported a tiny rhinestone collar. It turned out that the National Zoo had imported 18 black squirrels from Canada (where they remained relatively common) during Teddy Roosevelt’s administration (1901-1909). They were released on zoo grounds, quickly became acclimated, then spread throughout the city, which had previously lacked any appreciable squirrel population. Today, Maryland (at College Park and Joppatowne), Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, among other states, are noted as having populations or concentrations of black squirrels. Their exact source is undetermined or at least undocumented. More I don’t know, just as I don’t know how this one came to my yard.",Seen any black squirrels? Tell us where and when: [email protected],A triumph of hope over experience,"The 18th century English writer Samuel Johnson got it as right about New Year’s resolutions as about his original subject, marriage. That thought struck me as I attempted to set personal goals for the New Year, hoping these meet with more success than usual. I’m going to have to exercise to increase my energy and endurance throughout the winter if I am to mount the kind of fishing campaign I intend to begin in just four short months. Resolution Two is to simplify my tackle. Over the years I have accumulated an excess, to the point of hindering my activities. An angler does not need to choose from 100 lures when on the water. A dozen will do. I know many an angler who excels with less than half a dozen. Divesting myself of all of these lures is not without pain. I’ll have to find someone who wants them, for I can’t throw them away, and there is no practical market for used fishing lures. And I must do it well before the next season begins so there is no temptation to hold on to them. Resolution Three is to cull my outdoor clothes. My wife pointed that out just last week as she gathered used items for a Purple Heart collection. A lucky fishing shirt is difficult to resign to the rag bin, even if its elbows are holed. A significant portion of my many ball caps suggest they may also be well past their due date. I must send them all off without pity. Last comes the most painful resolution of all. I had some great angling successes last season but also some disappointments. I told myself that the brutal August heat dampened the bite for the following months as well. I was wrong. I have come to acknowledge my reluctance to rise early in the morning as the reason my later season fell off. Six o’clock may be early in the spring when the water temperatures are in the 50s and the bite will only get better as the sun brings more warmth to the depths. But from mid-August on, the fish will be on the move at the first blush of light when the water is at its coolest and most comfortable for them. That means rising at no later than 4am — and not just one or two mornings, when I feel conditions may be perfect, but every morning to give all of my sorties a better chance of success. The thought of that early hour brings tears to my eyes. But again, it must be done in 2017 or my freezer will be empty again next winter.",Fly south for angling adventure and comfort,"Icicles hang off my skiff, parked on its trailer in the side yard, as leafless tree limbs thrash the skyline and an icy rain falls, mostly sideways. It’s a grim picture, unless you adopt a southern perspective. With crude oil under $50 a barrel, airlines are reviving some sweet deals for an angler with a yen for warmer climes and gamer fish. Florida has some fares under $70 (Fort Lauderdale, each way). Even San Jose, Costa Rica, can now be economically reached, often for under $300 round trip. Both locations offer awesome fishing in the next few months. Boynton Beach and Deerfield Beach, just north of Miami, are hot for king mackerel, snook, seatrout and redfish from both the piers and beaches, as well as offering an excellent chance to tangle with 20- to 30-pound Jack Crevalle, one of the hardest-fighting gamefish that swims the Atlantic. Vinny Keitt (www.pier-masters), who introduced me and two of my sons to some excellent fishing around Boynton Beach, has an enthusiastic outlook for January and February. Vinny teaches how to catch the fish in his neighborhood as well as guiding (on foot) at the many public access beaches and piers for whatever is biting best at that moment. It’s 85 degrees and sunny down there right now. January and February will also bring great sailfish action to both Florida and Costa Rica. You’ll find affordable packages online for multiple locations around the Miami area (I recommend Rick and Jimbo on the Thomas Flyer, [email protected] The Costa Rican Pacific Coast, particularly the Quepos/Jaco areas, features vast numbers of the glamorous billfish. If you don’t mind shopping on foot a bit at the marina, local Costa Rican skippers with open 23- to 25-foot outboard-powered panga boats can put you onto the sails, only minutes offshore, for about $200 a day. Fly anglers dreaming of encounters with the legendary light-tackle skinny-water bonefish also have opportunities. Baltimore to Cancun, Mexico, air connection is direct and about $300 round trip if you can select your days. There are bonefish just north of the Cancun resort area for fishers who’ll rent a car and wade-fish the shoreline flats. For a guided experience for the grey ghosts, make arrangements on-line for fishing from Cancun south all the way to the Ascension Bay (Punta Allen) area. For do-it-yourselfers, driving down the coast from Cancun to Punta Allen, stopping at local motels and wade-fishing the shoreline flats, can also result in some very inexpensive and rewarding fishing adventures. All of these areas are among the safest in Mexico, but you do have to use common sense when deciding where and when to explore. Anglers hoping to tangle with heavier-weight offshore fish also have some economical options. Direct flights from Baltimore to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on the southern Pacific Coast are available for under $400. January, February and March are the peak of the striped marlin season (100 to 250 pounds). Again, local fishermen operating 23- to 25-foot open pangas are available for hire quite reasonably, as are the larger, sleeker sport fishing boats at higher prices. Multiple billfish days are the norm there this time of year. Your only limitation is how much excitement and fish-fighting exertion you can handle. Accommodations range from expensive waterfront luxury to simple fish-camp-quality motels at much more affordable rates. If you’ve a yen to travel a bit during Maryland’s winter, an adventurous angler has a great many options.",Sure-to-please choices,"You’ve tried to choose a gift for the sport in your life, the dedicated angler, canoeist, hiker, shooter or sailor. And you’ve failed. The look in an aficionado’s eye on opening a present naively intended to enhance the enjoyment of a particular sport is a dead giveaway. Just what am I going to do with this? Next — but too late to mask the eye movement and expression of astonishment — come effusive explanations of just how special the gift is and how much it is appreciated. Here’s how to do better this year. If you are not dead certain that the gift is indeed unique and desirable within the context of that sport —almost impossible if you don’t share the passion — give a gift certificate. A certificate for a favorite restaurant is an excellent choice, as is one from a good sporting goods store. If the person in question is keen, sartorial-wise, a certificate from one of the better area clothing stores will may be the ticket. For those impossible to anticipate, I note that liquor stores are beginning to sell holiday gift cards. But if you must choose a sporting gift, try something like this. For boaters, a new piece of technological boating gear has recently arrived in retail stores to satisfy a safety requirement of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Weems and Plath electronic flare and emergency SOS light. Flares are required to be onboard any craft larger than 16 feet that intends to go on big water or operate at night. Flares inevitably have an expiration date (usually three years hence) and are inherently dangerous to operate. This new electronic flare never expires, is safe to use and is superior in terms of visibility and effectiveness of operation. All boaters will eventually possess one of these new devices in lieu of the incendiaries. If you want your skipper to appreciate your thoughtfulness, and to keep safe at the same time, giving one of these new devices is a sure avenue to success. LED flashlights are also an ideal gift for the sports inclined, especially the small units with high light output (1,000-plus lumens). These devices can be lifesavers in emergencies. Every car, motorcycle, boat (or other floating or moving conveyance) should have one somewhere onboard. They’re also handy for non-sporting occasions as they thoroughly illuminate any dim, dark walks back to an automobile and can effectively (though briefly) blind and ward off anyone who threatens to approach uncomfortably close. The better ones are the size of a small candy bar. Another unique LED creation is the Larry Light, a small, inexpensive, bright stick of lights that is directional and magnetized so that it can be attached anywhere there is metal for hands-free illumination of dark recesses. They’re also handy for casual photographic applications. The incredibly efficient Yeti brand coolers have become quite popular of late despite their hefty price tags. Yeti also offers hot/cold drink cups and thermos bottles that are unbelievably efficient as well as more affordable. They make an ideal gift for almost anyone.","Adjust your dress and technique, and you might still catch one","This is the end my friend, the end. It hurts to set you free.","Rock legend Jim Morrison’s words echo my thoughts as our rockfish season heads to a close on Dec­ember 20. It has been a fine year chasing my favorite Bay species, and I still hope for a few more encounters. I’ve gotten in some good December licks in the past. Jigging around the Eastern Shore rock pile at the Bay Bridge has been memorably productive during this last month. Though I’ve been out of action recently with unexpected boat motor repairs and foul weather, I am itching for another chance or two. Just a couple of years ago, a friend and I couldn’t get a jig with a small dropper to the bottom for all the big white perch that were schooled there. The reason? Four- and five-pound rockfish would pounce on the rig before it was halfway down. The year before that, a simple two-ounce jig with a lip-hooked minnow slow bumped along deep shell was the key to lots of striped winter action. I’m planning over the next few days to be trying them all, especially a chartreuse Bernie’s Bomber rig, a two-ounce feather-dressed jig followed with a fluorescent yellow Meushaw jig dropper. Stripers will be my target, but I won’t discard any chunky white perch that decide to jump the rig. Both rockfish and white perch are at their dinner-table best this time of year, fat as pigs from fall feeding and as firm as tuna from the deep cold water both species prefer this time of year. Of course Maryland’s winter weather will always play a role in deciding when to go. Since I’m fishing from a light 17-foot skiff, I’ll stick to windless days with temperatures in the mid-50s and won’t stray too far from the boat ramp. Though in my youth, nothing discouraged me until my rod guides started freezing up, the last few years I’ve discovered the December conditions much more uncomfortable than I remembered them. Waterproof (not water-resistant) foul weather coat and pants are a must, even on calm sunny days. It doesn’t take much for an errant bow wave to splash onto the boat and soak your clothes. I don’t care what the advertisements say: No matter what you’re wearing, it won’t keep you warm if it’s wet. A good hat is a must. Bring an extra along in case the first blows off while you’re at speed. Gloves are handy but don’t expect to keep them dry, so stay away from fleece. Wool is best. It’s also a good idea to bring a hot beverage in a good-quality thermos, as it will keep your core warm and make everything more comfortable. Limit your alcohol intake. In quantity, alcohol gives the illusion of warming you up while actually dropping your body temp. Keep in mind that as the water temperatures fall, especially below 50 degrees, fish will search for their prey more and more by smell and less by vision. Adding a strip of fresh bait to your lures or going strictly to live bait will generally improve your results. Using synthesized potions to make your baits more scent attractive can also be helpful. Slowing your retrieves and lure action to match the lower metabolisms of the cold-blooded quarry is wise. Expect extreme patience to pay off more than constant relocation and experimentation.",Four faults that lead to lost fish — and how to correct them,"That moment is clearly etched in my memory. It was early evening as my skiff softly coasted into a deserted shoreline. I was a long cast off a small tidal pond outlet at the first stages of a falling flood. Firing a top-water plug to just a foot or two off the sand, I gave the lure the slightest pop. A mighty swirl engulfed the bait, and my pulse went sky-high. Feeling immediate pressure on my line, I set the hook, and a large, powerful fish took off, sending its wake cascading along the shoreline like breaking surf. The reel drag started its song, and my rod bowed deeply. Then, inexplicably, the fish was gone. My heart plummeted. Reeling in the line, dejected, I had a strong suspicion of what had just happened. As I lifted the plug to my hand, my fears were confirmed. My line had fouled the front hook during the cast. Sometimes there is little you can do to prevent entangling the lure. But, minimally, keeping the lure steady and not tumbling during its flight can be critical, and not just for optimum distance. Avoiding excess wrist snap at the end of the casting stroke tends to produce a smoother, more controlled throw. If a multi-hooked plug tumbles in the air, there is a good chance the loose trailing line will foul, particularly on that front treble hook. An angler might not notice the problem during the retrieve, but it will most definitely impact the outcome of any rockfish battle. Since the line has become wrapped around the bend in the front hook and the front of the lure is, inevitably, the end a striper will attack, the pressure from the angler in fighting the fish will eventually pull that fouled hook backwards, out of the fish’s mouth. The next most frequent cause of losing a good fish just after the strike is slack line. This is particularly true of spin-casting tackle. If the arc of the line trailing the lure is excessive — either because of a high overhand cast or from the effect of a brisk wind — a large amount of loose line will be pulled off of the spool. Before the angler can again come tight to the lure and regain control of that slack, a fish may have struck and spit the bait. Even if the force of the fish’s strike sinks a hook without much angler pressure, that slack may have allowed only light hook penetration. The fight from a lightly hooked fish is usually short and not in favor of the angler. Keeping the casting arc low to the water during windy conditions and avoiding high-arching overhead casts minimizes this problem. Another cause of many lost game fish is the quality and condition of the hooks. Saltwater is relentless for encouraging rust. There are no remedies for hooks that become oxidized except replacement. Under magnification, a rusted hook will show a very rough surface requiring a much greater force than an unaffected hook to penetrate a fish’s jaws, particularly larger fish that tend to have age-hardened mouth structures. A rusty hook will still get bites and strikes, but a fresh, sharp hook will always get the fish: So goes the angling dictum. The last significant cause of losing a good game fish at any stage of the fight is rod-handling technique. Close syncopation with the rod and reel is necessary to bring a fish to hand. The key is gaining line by stroking the rod smoothly and forcefully back (preferably to the side), then reeling in the gained line while continuing to maintain pressure on the fish, especially while lowering the rod in preparation for another retrieval stroke.","Gas, oil and battery need attention before the freeze hits","There’s lots to do to winterize your boat and motor, and lots of checklists online and at marine stores tell you how. Let me remind you of the steps that can be the most critical. Topping off your boat’s gas tanks and dosing with the correct amount of fuel stabilizer is first on the list of must-do’s. Seek out ethanol-free gasoline (E-0), as it is relatively stable during storage. Ethanol is an additive present in 90 percent of all gasoline sold in this country. E-10 contains 10 percent ethanol, and E-15 has 15 percent. Ethanol is mandated by the U.S. government to reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources. Modern marine motors are designed to run on all of the ethanol-added fuels, but problems can occur in extended storage. Gasoline itself can absorb a small amount of moisture. Ethanol can accumulate 50 to 60 times more, generally from condensation inside the fuel tank. When the ethanol accumulates too much moisture, phase separation occurs. The fuel separates into two distinct layers, a top layer of (now) low-octane gasoline and a bottom layer of water-rich ethanol. Neither of these is desirable in a modern outboard engine. Both can cause damage. If your motor will not start or it suddenly runs poorly, phase separation might be the cause. Do not try adding fresh gas, as it will not effectively mix with the separated fuel. Drain the tank and dispose of the spoiled gasoline at a hazardous waste site. The next most important step is changing the lower unit oil. The lower unit of an outboard contains the drive gears and prop shaft, rather like the transmission of an automobile. The gears are lubricated by thick 90-weight oil. It’s a good idea to change it every year. Winterizing is the best time, for two reasons. First, so you don’t forget to do it. Second, to be sure the prop shaft seals have retained their waterproof integrity. When drained oil has a white or milk-colored tone, your seals are failing and should be replaced. If you do not drain your oil and the engine is stored outside over winter, any water that has leaked into the lower unit will eventually separate from the oil and accumulate at the bottom. When temperatures drop below 32 degrees, that water will freeze. Expansion can crack the unit’s casing, disabling your engine and incurring a costly repair. Replacing the seals is not a difficult operation, and manuals and websites describe exactly how to do it. If you prefer to have a professional mechanic handle the operation, be sure that you do it over the winter while their workloads are at a minimum. If you wait for springtime, the busiest time of year for marine mechanics, you may wait weeks. The last must-do is to disconnect your engine’s battery. Optimally you should remove it from the boat, store it in a temperature-stable area and place it on a maintenance charger. At minimum, it should be completely disconnected. Most boat motors, bilge pumps and general electronics are sophisticated enough to include some monitoring devices that will continue to operate even if the unit is off. While drawing only a miniscule amount of power, they will drain the battery over time, then keep it drained. And you’ll need a new battery come spring.",Give yourself plenty of options for catching stripers this time of year,"I knew exactly what I wanted to do. With ice in my cooler, a couple of bottles of water and a box of surface lures, I headed out just before sundown for the mouth of a nearby tributary. Planning a top-water assault to repeat a recent evening’s triumph, my hopes were high. Everything was perfect: low light, high water, moving tide and no wind. The only missing element was the fish. I worked up and down the shallow shoreline to no avail. Finally, searching in my boat bag, I discovered a lone Rat-L-Trap. On my third cast with it, I finally came tight with a rockfish. However it was only a 16-incher, and worse, it was alone. Looking about in frustration I noticed a group of boats working a distant channel edge. Time was running out as I quietly motored near. One look at my electronic finder explained the fleet’s presence. Scattered marks of sizeable fish suspended at 10 feet were along the edge, definitely a rockfish signature. I drifted and cast through the area, allowing my crank bait time to sink. No success. The other anglers appeared to be casting assassin-type baits. I dove into my under-seat storage, praying I had some stashed somewhere. Near the bottom, I came up with a small, weathered box of half-ounce jig heads and a couple of old five-inch assassins in white. That would have to do. Keeping an eye on the nearest skiff to see if anyone was actually catching, I finally noticed an angler lean over and furtively lip a fish in the mid-20s up and over the side. The boats were crowding each other unceremoniously close. It was getting dark. The action would soon cease, if the presence of so many craft wasn’t forcing it already. Flipping my jig out and giving it a chance to sink below the marks, I worked it back with an erratic stop and go. It took two or three drifts and a few dozen casts, but I finally hooked a good fish. Letting it run a bit, I began to think I wasn’t going to get skunked. Then it was gone. For another hour, I worked the water. As it grew deep dark and the fleet dissipated, I reconstructed my poor decisions. I should have been on the water earlier … I shouldn’t have wasted so much time working a poor method … I should have had a wider selection of baits. Betting all my chips on surface action in one area was too risky. The mouth of this river had become recently popular. I knew that rockfish get lure- and boat-noise shy after just a few encounters. I persisted. Yet I knew better — and will do better the next time. For spooky fall fish, assassin-type bodies on jig heads tend to be the most reliable bait. Even better are assassins rigged Texas-style with a bullet-shaped head weight and the hook point buried just under the soft body. Such bait is virtually snag-free, a real advantage in working the shallows. It will also fish well in deeper water, and it can be retrieved extra slow, allowing the stripers to mouth it, another real advantage with tentative fish. As my ace in the hole, I’ll have four or five small white perch in my live well. They might do the trick in the end. It’s hard for a hungry rockfish to resist the real thing. As I headed for home, the skunk smell following me, I swore that the next time I would be better prepared.",You’ve got a treasure; take care of it,"Back in the mid-1940s, the advent of the spinning reel made angling a popular America sport. Spin reels opened up light-tackle fishing to millions for the first time. The easy-to-use casting mechanism allowed anglers to throw their line, lure or bait a good distance without worry of tangles. Penn spin reels became the saltwater standard of the day. By the mid-1970s, their price approached $100. This was a considerable sum, but they were rugged quality reels made in America. You could count on a Penn. The reels were easily maintained with an occasional squirt of oil, and customer service was great. If you had problems with your Penn that you couldn’t handle yourself, it could be returned to the company and refurbished promptly in the neighborhood of $10, as I recall, and that included return postage. People treasured and passed down their Penn reels from generation to generation. However at the same time, manufacturing of fishing tackle began to shift to offshore anglers, which resulted in lower costs and increased product competition. Design and materials improvement accelerated as angling became even more popular in the U.S., then worldwide. As prices dropped, when a reel was damaged or began to malfunction, it became more convenient to replace it than to bear the cost and inconvenience of shipping and repair. Plus, constant technological advances and better engineering made most newer models superior. Today’s reels are nothing short of magnificent, and their costs have risen accordingly. Material and engineering development have matured to the point that these mechanisms are not going to get noticeably better in the foreseeable future. As a result, it’s starting to make sense once again to take care of the gear we have, keep it in good working order and maintain it for its full life expectancy. Manufacturers have also sensed this change in the dynamics of the market and improved their customer service. Looking online you’ll find all the better tackle companies offering on-line schematics, parts lists and detailed maintenance instructions. Plus, many websites discuss specific repairs and how to accomplish them on virtually every brand and model of spin reel now available. More and more anglers are, once again, providing their own intensive maintenance to their reels to ensure performance and longevity and — while they’re at it — even upgrading mechanisms to include friction-free ceramic bearings, carbon-fiber drag washers, newer high-tech low-friction lubricants and, in general, keeping the gear up to any angling task and in top condition for years to come. For anglers, the disposable-equipment culture may at last be over.","When the rockfish wanted to wrangle, I was more than ready","Trepidation is the condition of being uncertain of a situation’s outcome to the point of anxiety. Trepidation was also an apt description of my mental state as I prepped my casting rod and checked the three-quarter-ounce surface popper I had chosen to begin my quest. I had just lowered my skiff’s Power Pole anchor onto the far end of a sunken rock jetty that ran for a good 70 yards from a boulder-encrusted shoreline. A few years ago this time of year, I had many a fantastic late afternoon tempting rockfish into attacking virtually anything that splashed or popped through the rips that formed here. Over the last few seasons, however, the area had become mysteriously bereft of fish. Though I continued to visit, my efforts had mostly resulted in a lot of nothing. As I tried yet once again, I steeled myself for another angling defeat in spite of the excellent conditions: calm water, a good high tide and little wind. Waiting some long minutes for the wake from my skiff’s arrival to dissipate along the empty shoreline, I finally lifted the rod and sent an easy cast arcing out over the water to what had once been a sweet spot in a prominent rip. It’s my habit to thumb the cast as it approaches the water, not only to prevent an over-run but also to eliminate any slack in the line and make certain that the lure lands tail-end first. As soon as it splashes I give it a short spurt, my theory being that the prompt movement assures any striped predator alerted to the noise of the fall that that particular creature is alive and attempting to escape. My effort to action the plug was a failure — due not to any slack in my line but to something big having already eaten the lure. As I came tight, I added a little extra effort to ensure a hook set. The explosion that followed sent a column of water almost as high as my soaring spirits. One of the pleasures of hooking a good fish on a top-water bait is seeing it try to shake loose from the attacking lure’s grasp. This hefty rockfish rocketed from the water sideways, swinging its head and body recklessly across the top of the rip, submerged and re-emerged in a frothy surface tantrum. Then it headed for deeper water. After a patient struggle, I led an exhausted and silvery fish into the net. Exhilarated, I removed the lure from the fish’s mouth, took a quick picture and eased it into a bed of ice. I planned to celebrate this victory more than once. Another cast toward the same rip was rewarded with an instant blowup. Nerves somehow in check, I managed to keep from striking at the sound of the exploding water. My plug hung suspended about two feet in the air above the roiled surface. As it fell back, it was attacked and, again, sent flying, then sent flying again. Apparently these fish were in a mood to play with their food. Eventually retrieving the lure, I sent it out to a different area. The same thing happened, but this time one of the fish finally caught a hook, and another fight was on. This extravaganza went on until dark when, despite the lingering bite, I picked up and headed home. A clear sky and big moon gave me plenty of light to avoid the crab buoys as I exulted all the way home.","© Copyright 2019, New Bay Enterprises, Inc. All rights reserved."

,Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane praised matchwinner Isco’s importance to the team after the ex-Malaga player scored one and made the other in Sunday evening’s 2-1 La Liga victory at his former club.,"With stars including Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale left at home, Isco put the visitors ahead with a 25-yard free kick just before the half-hour mark, then assisted teammate Casemiro to make it 2-0 midway through the second half.","The local boy left the pitch with 20 minutes remaining to a standing ovation from his former club’s fans, for whom Diego Rolan’s added-time goal was not much consolation with Malaga now 14 points off safety with just six games remaining.","The Los Blancos coach told the postmatch news conference that he was happy with Isco’s performance, especially that he had not just played well but been decisive on the scoreboard.","“We are happy with [Isco’s] game, and with his goal,” Zidane said. “It is important to score sometimes too. He played a great game back home, and I am happy for him and the team. The fans here received him very well and he deserved that. He has been an important player for Malaga, and today he is for Madrid.”","The three points lifted last year’s La Liga champions to third in the table, albeit 15 points behind this season’s runaway leaders Barcelona. Zidane said a victory had been important especially after losing 3-1 at home to Juventus in Wednesday’s Champions League quarterfinal second leg, even if they had still progressed 4-3 on aggregate.","“We are happy to be back into third place,” Zidane said. “We played a very serious game, respecting the rival, it is not easy to play against a team who maybe do not deserve to be bottom of the table. We were not happy after the defeat at home to Juve. We were happy to go through, but not to lose the game. We had to win today and we did that.”","There was no injury reason for Bale’s absence, Zidane said, while suggesting there would be further rotation in Wednesday’s La Liga game at home to Athletic Bilbao, with a week then to prepare for the UCL semifinal first leg at Bayern Munich on April 25.","“Three or four players were rested, Gareth too,” the Frenchman said. “It is not easy as I try and do as well as possible while rotating the team. We still have one game before the semifinal, on Wednesday, then a week to prepare. It is important to have all the players fit and healthy.”","Karim Benzema returned to the XI after remaining on the bench against Juve midweek, and although playing very well in open play the much-criticised centre-forward remains almost two months without a goal in open play.","“Of course he would like to score too, but [Benzema] will not throw in the towel,” Zidane said. “He had chances today, played very well, but he just lacked a goal for sure.

Live stats and video stream are available via the multimedia tab on the SAU athletic site.,"Northwestern is fresh off a dramatic home victory in week three against Henderson State, 30-24. The loss the Rangers handed to HSU was the first loss on the road to an Oklahoma team since the inception of the Great American Conference.","In that game, Jacob Peyton continued to slice the opposing defenses as he rushed for a career high 172 yards against the Reddies, the most by a Ranger since joining the NCAA. The redshirt junior has rushed for 333 yards in the past two weeks of action as he moved his rushing average to 136 yards per game, the ninth best average in the nation.","While the Northwestern offense has been playing well this season, they will be up against the top defense in the GAC and the tenth best scoring defense in the nation. Southern Arkansas has allowed just 11.7 points per game, oppose to Northwestern’s 29 points a ball game.","In terms of yards, Northwestern currently boasts the No. 2 GAC offense with over 444 yards per contest, while the Muleriders are holding opponents to 298 yards a game, the second fewest in the league.",Southern Arkansas is sitting in an early tie atop the conference standings with Ouachita Baptist at 3-0. The Muleriders are ranked No. 21 this week in the D2Football.com poll and No. 19 in the American Football Coaches Association poll.,A win for the Rangers would be the first against a ranked opponent since they toppled No. 10 Southern Nazarene when both schools were members of the NAIA and the Central States Football League.,"620 Choctaw StreetAlva, Oklahoma 73717Ph: (580) 327-2200",© 2019 Martin Broadcasting,Powered by ROAR Online Publication Software from Lions Light Corporation © Copyright 2019

Please read the rules before joining the discussion.,MYERSTOWN >> The Elco boys tennis team was just happy to be there.,Even knowing what was likely coming its way.,"Then again, there are a lot of teams that would have been glad to take the Raiders' place in perennial power Hempfield's line of fire on Monday afternoon.","As has been the case for much of the recent past, Elco qualified for the Lancaster-Lebanon League playoffs and didn't stay there long, courtesy of a Section One heavyweight.","This time, and for the second year in a row, it was the Black Knights, who needed barely 45 minutes to roll past the Raiders, 3-0, in a rain-shortened L-L semifinal matchup at Elco High School.","Now 14-1, Section One runner-up Hempfield quickly swept the two doubles matches, then grabbed the No. 3 singles contest in short order to sew up a trip to Tuesday's league title match against Section One champ Manheim Township, a 3-0 semifinal winner over Cocalico.","Section Two champ Elco (11-2), a state tournament qualifier a season ago, can now focus on the L-L individual tourney that begins on Thursday, and the upcoming District Three Class AA Team Championships, where it will be a likely No. 2 seed; which is pretty much how the Raiders figured it would go when the day began.","""We're just happy to be here,"" Elco coach Zach Cook said, as he dodged some post-match raindrops. ""We always know that Hempfield and Manheim Township are fantastic teams, but it's always fantastic competition and gets us ready for the next level far more than what we'd get from anyone else in Section Two.","""Do we always get our clocks cleaned by Hempfield and Township? Absolutely. But it gets us ready. We're not gonna see a better team than Hempfield all year.""",The Black Knights certainly proved Cook right on Monday.,"En route to clinching the win, the visitors dropped a grand total of two games in three matches, with Jacob Curtin officially wrapping up the win with a 6-0, 6-0 rout of Dylan Spitler at No. 3 singles. Prior to that, Jay Cooke and Nick Aksu took care of Linden and Mason Bennetch, 6-1, 6-0, at No. 1 doubles, and Andrew Virts and Jack Hessinger cruised past Christian Stahl and Adam Omar, 6-0, 6-1, in the No. 2 match.","The Raiders fared better at No. 1 and 2 singles before the rains came. Adam Bahney trailed Derek Hagino, 4-6, 2-2, at No. 1 singles, while Galen McNaughton was threatening to force a third set at No. 2 singles, locked in a 5-5 second-set tie with Calvin Athey after dropping the first set by a 6-1 score.","""Depth-wise, I'm happy with where we're at. But it'd be nice to be Hempfield,"" Cook said of the Black Knights' impressive top-to-bottom lineup strength that told the story of Monday's match.","Still, nothing that happened on Monday could take away from what the Raiders have accomplished to date or the district team goals they're still pursuing.","""We're always looking to win a match, but I knew five points was gonna be tough to come by today,"" Cook said. ""But this is great experience for us. It helps us immensely. I love just to be in this match.""","Hempfield 3, Elco 0 at Elco","Singles— 1. Derek Hagino (H) led Adam Bahney, 6-4, 2-2 (suspended), 2.

Follow Us,Twitter,LinkedIn,Facebook,"FREMONT, CA- The City of Westminster and Passport today announced the launch of the new ParkRight parking app that will improve the way drivers pay for parking throughout Westminster.","The refreshed ParkRight app was developed by global transportation software leader, Passport, and was designed in order to refine the Westminster parking payment experience. With Passport’s expertise, the ParkRight app is premiering a new user-friendly app flow, including an enhanced ‘find parking’ feature and improved payment process. With these updates, ParkRight will better meet the needs of residents, visitors, and city officials.","“ParkRight is symbolic of the next chapter in Westminster parking,” said Kieran Fitsall, Head of Service Improvement & Transformation and City Management & Communities of the City of Westminster. “The new ParkRight app is a powerful mobile platform customized to our city’s specifications. The new system will ensure an easier process for finding and purchasing parking, while also providing our officials with the data to make more informed decisions.

"College football brings together millions every year. Some of the best players in College football are given recognition every year by College football legend Kirk Herbstreit. The awards have been in existence for a long time, and are given to many categories of College Football participants, be it fans, coaches, players, even to categories like favorite restaurants, and strongest student sections. This year, there were many Herbie awards given to a variety of recipients One of Herbstreit’s strongest awards is Unsung Hero, and this year’s winner was Hunter Renfrow, a wide receiver of the Clemson Tigers. Renfrow is hailed for a very consistent input to the offense of his team, with catches and yardage spread across all his games. While Renfrow didn’t necessarily steal the show every week, his consistent and pivotal output earned him Herbstreit’s Unsung Hero award, and deservedly so. The cornerstone to any great college football program is a powerful defense, and the cornerstone to any powerful defense is a strong pass rush presence. Often, this is handled by individual superstars in a defensive lineup, players that always seem to bring pressure few others can put together. This year, Herbstreit recognized Alabama’s LB Tim Williams as this year’s Pass Rush Specialist. At the helm of the best college football programs stands the figure running the offense, the quarterback. While college has always been a platform for rushing quarterbacks to make an impact, Herbstreit recognizes those who consistently run the game with their arm. This year, Herbstreit’s Pure Passer award for 2016 goes to UCLA powerhouse Quarterback Josh Rosen. Rosen proved himself a significant player and threat throughout the year and earned his slot as Herbstreit’s Pure Passer award winner.","College football brings together millions every year.

An opportunity lies in Research to work across divisions and departments to create a unified language that ensures that internal clients understand—and take advantage of—complex metrics. The key is giving the necessary context so that decisions can be made. While this sounds disarmingly simple, it is a challenge to get the majority of the company to speak the same language and understand new vernacular. Research is a central force within the broader organization in gaining an objective perspective for a wide array of complex questions. It may sound academic – and certainly there is a portion of the job that requires a love of learning – but the primary attribute that will bring you success is curiosity. For example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of what motivates someone to tune into a show, buy a product based on placement of an ad, become a fan on social media, or why certain types of programs are successful across regions of this country and abroad.

(800) 909-5193,"The Cubs started a 3 game series at home against the Pirates today, as I write this Chicago is 2-0 in the bottom of the 6th, which is not surprising. Arrieta has just been pulled from the game so we will see how the game ends but so far it has been all about the Cubs.","Tomorrow’s game will start at 8:15 pm ET in historic Wrigley Field, home of the Cubs since 1916. The Cubs just dropped 2 games against the Nationals and ended this year’s series 5-2 which I suppose is not bad but they were hoping for a clean sweep. This year the Chicago team has been impressive although they have slipped as of late, I just hope this is not an ongoing trend. Part of me is a Cub fan just because my Dad liked them and he would have loved to see them win the World Series.","This match up should be all about the Cubs, they are currently 12 games ahead of their opponents and by the end of the day they might be 13 games ahead; their pitching staff has been on fire the entire season, something that cannot be said about the Pirates whose pitchers have struggled and the entire team seems to be suffering from an identity crisis, however Pittsburgh is one of those teams that can make a comeback when you need them to, and this might be one of those times. They are currently in 3rd place in the NL Central, and quite honestly if they want a chance at the wild card they simply cannot afford to be swept by the Cubs in this series.","Analyzing the probable pitchers for the 2 remaining games this weekend, their one chance of not being swept lies with Jameson Taillon who is set to start in Sunday night’s game against Kyle Hendricks. Taillon has an ERA of 1.93 while Hendricks ERA is 3.05, so this is their best chance to beat the Cubbies at home.","Saturday’s game will feature Jon Lester on the mound for Chicago versus Jon Niese of the Pirates, if the game is solely judged on the pitching staff this is a very lopsided match. 32-year-old left handed Lester is 8-3 this season with an ERA of 1.89, while 29-year-old Jonathon Niese who is also a left hander has a record of 6-3 with an ERA of 4.60. But baseball is a team sport and not just about the pitcher, not that this helps the Pirates any. Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant have been very consistent for the Cubs offense the entire season and so far this month Jason Heyward has had an incredible at bat.","So bottom line is the Cubs will win the series, but I expect they will drop one game to the Pirates on Sunday.

He refused to comment on his kill to DailyMail.com at his doorstep",+13,"The video of Gorney, a retired energy company executive, is believed to have been recorded in Zimbabwe in 2011","Even as it lay motionless, enjoying the African sun, Gorney couldn’t take out the male lion with a clean shot from his high-powered rifle. Instead it woke after being hit and was seen writhing in agony before he could finish it off with two more bullets.","Gorney is then seen celebrating with Mark Vallaro, a professional hunter in Zimbabwe who was acting as his guide.","Vallaro is heard telling Gorney to stop shooting after the third bullet, then he says: ‘That, Mr. Gorney, is a very nice lion. A very nice lion.’","As Gorney approaches the lion, poking it with his rifle to make sure it is dead, Vallaro adds: ‘Beautiful. That is an exceptional lion.’","Gorney, 64, has been vilified for his actions, with comic Ricky Gervais — an outspoken critic of trophy hunting — calling him a ‘sniveling sadistic coward’ in a tweet.",Top golfer Ian Poulter also tweeted: ‘How brave you are. How pathetic shooting something that’s sleeping. This has to be STOPPED. #Coward.’,"DailyMail.com columnist Piers Morgan said he felt ‘physically sick’ watching the video, saying: ‘Only someone with a severe mental illness could possibly enjoy doing what you did to that poor unconscious lion.",‘The ecstatic thrill it gave you suggests you’re a psychopathic monster devoid of any empathy or compassion.’,"Gorney lives in a five-bedroom home in Manhattan, Illinois, a wealthy village 50 miles southwest of Chicago. A large wooden American flag hangs on his front door, along with a religious message. Two SUVs and a pick-up truck sit in the driveway with a large RV in the back yard.","This is the half-million-dollar Illinois home where Gorney was approached by DailyMail.com but he refused comment, saying ‘I’m not interested in talking to you. Private property. Take off!’",+13,"In the video, Gorney fires one shot, and awakens the unsuspecting lion to meet its demise",+13,+13,"The lion can be seen writhing in pain on the ground, after being awakened by the attack",+13,"‘Beautiful,’ the guide says, as the video shows a closeup of the lifeless animal’s face","He has visited Africa several times to kill big game, once boasting that he has bagged all of the ‘big five’ animals that are said to be the most difficult to kill on foot — the lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and Cape buffalo. Of the five, the buffalo is the only one that is not endangered.","‘You can say, why’d you shoot a lion?’ he said during a 2015 interview with WBBM-FM, a radio station in Chicago.","‘I love zebra, so shooting a lion probably saves 70 zebra a year, give or take. There’s all these kinds of balances in nature.’","However, his Facebook page, which he has now taken down, contained a photo of a zebra’s head in his vehicle with the caption: ‘Now how did this get in my truck?",A picture of his ‘trophy room’ showed 17 stuffed animals and two zebra skins.,"He admitted in the old interview that his hunting is mainly for the thrill of the kill. ‘I really like hunting elephants,’ he said. ‘They’re difficult to track down. They’re incredibly dangerous.","‘The first elephant I got, I walked over 120 miles tracking elephants before I actually caught up to him and found him.",Gorney said he had a hard time understanding why people could accept deer hunting in the United States but not big game hunting in Africa.,"‘If you have a picture of somebody with a deer, nobody seems to care. But if it’s an elephant, it’s a big problem. If it’s a lion – especially now – it’s a huge problem. But to me, either way, I’ve stopped a beating heart.’","He did not address the question of deer normally being killed to be eaten while big game is usually just for the trophy, or the fact that most species of deer are not endangered.","Gorney even invoked the memory of former president Theodore Roosevelt during the interview. ‘When I killed that buffalo that had hurt somebody, the people that had benefited from the death of that animal cheered. Clapped.",‘The ‘why’ is just the – I call it the adventure of it. Same reason Teddy Roosevelt did it.’,"Last year Gorney got up during an open mic night for authors at the Book and Bean Café in Joliet, Illinois, a few miles from his home, where he said he ‘travels’ a lot’ and writes journals.","He said once in Africa he had been asked to deal with a lion that had attacked livestock. ‘When they get like that, they are not killing to feed, they are just killing, so they are particularly dangerous.’","In a 2015 interview, Gorney addressed violent reactions to trophy hunting by pointing out he can defend himself. Gorney is pictured with a hippopotamus that he killed",+13,"In the interview from 2015 with CBS, Gorney showed no remorse for his ‘hunting’ habit, which at that time included killing 70 big game animals, such as elephant, lion, leopard, rhino and buffalo. Gorney is pictured with a rhino that he killed",+13,"‘The “why” is just the – I call it the adventure of it. Same reason Teddy Roosevelt did it,’ Gorney said. ‘I really like hunting elephants. They’re difficult to track down. They’re incredibly dangerous. The first elephant I got, I walked over 120 miles tracking elephants before I actually caught up to him and found him’",+13,"The hunter also appears to enjoy searching for prey – including moose and bear – closer to home, in North America, as well as the African bush where he bagged a sleeping lion","He said he volunteered to help, ‘literally putting himself in harm’s way.’","As he sat in a tree waiting for the lion to attack an animal he was using as bait, he heard a noise behind him and furiously began to plan in his mind how he was going to kill the lion if it attacked.",But the story ended when the animal that approached turned out to be merely a porcupine. He did not say whether he killed it anyway.,"Since the furor caused by the newly released video, Gorney has taken down his Facebook page which showed him with his kills, including one of him straddling a lion while wearing the same clothes he had on in the video.","That was in stark contrast to 2015 when he told WBBM’s Steve Miller he would not remove the page due to public anger. ‘I thought about taking it down, but I really have a problem changing my behavior over people that are just over the top,’ he said.","The video of Gorney killing the lion was posted on the British Twitter account @Protect_Wldlife — which has nearly 335,000 followers — on Monday. The administrator says: ‘I am an advocate for wildlife. I expose animal abuse and abusers wherever they are. I will NEVER stop fighting for better animal rights and welfare.’",+13,"The account which shared the video is an animal rights advocacy account, based in the United Kingdom, according to the information on the page, under username @Protect_Wldlife",+13,"Top golfer Ian Poulter expressed his outrage over the killing, asking how Gorney can sleep at night","Others suggested penalties for the actions of Gorney as shown in the video. ‘In my book that should be 5 years in jail. Grotesque,’ one user wrote","‘Even if it was awake, the Poor Animal Shouldn’t be Killed AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!! EVIL B*****D!!!!!!!!!! [various emojis],’ wrote another user","Many expressed objection over trophy hunting, in general, regardless of whether the animal was asleep at the time of its killing",Many Twitter users called out the ‘cowardice’ of attacking the wild animal at rest.,"‘A sleeping lion, wow what a big man!’ wrote one user, alongside an angry, cursing emoji.","Many expressed their objection to trophy hunting in general, regardless of whether the animal was asleep at the time of its killing.","‘This is not hunting, or sport…it’s murder #stoptrophyhunting #Fightforyourworld.’ user @verdiKate wrote.","‘Even if it was awake, the Poor Animal Shouldn’t be Killed AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!

Grotesque,’ one user wrote.","Another still called for a punishment in kind, replying, ‘More like fed 2 a pride of lions & eaten alive.’",https://www.animalalliance.ca/news/,"The late American poet-philosopher Maya Angelou said: “Hate, it has caused a lot of problems in the world, but has not solved one yet.”","I think it’s a safe bet that the quote, and Angelou, are both unknown to newly elected Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who once said: “If she walked by me, I wouldn’t have a clue who she is.” His ignorance in that case was in reference to possibly Canada’s most famous, easily recognized living writer (and a resident of the city whose mayor was Ford’s own brother and who Ford, as a councillor, was helping to govern), Margaret Atwood. She had corrected Ford’s absurd assertion that his ward contained more libraries than Tim Horton’s coffee shops.","That level of ignorance is no virtue. If I may quote Angelou once more: “ <https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1567235> The root cause of all the problems we have in the world today is ignorance of course. But most, polarization.”","To the “populist” politicians and their “base”, their core supporters, it is not what is factual, but what you feel, what your intuition, your “gut”, tells you, that counts.","And in answering the question posed at by the title of this blog, it is important to first understand that hate, ignorance and polarization are not only handmaidens (all puns intended) of each other but exactly what Ford’s plan to wipe out Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, encompasses. He indeed polarizes.","The issue is that, as is the inclination of authoritarian political leaders, without consultation Ford has proposed a series of Draconian legislative steps that will greatly damage Ontario’s environment, and wildlife, in various ways.","This includes a plan to re-define the Double-crested Cormorant as a “game” bird, with an open season that lasts from March 15 to December 31, and no limit on “possession”.","For the first time in Canadian game management, hunted birds won’t have to be utilized as food. Any hunter with the correct small game hunting license could legally kill well over 13,000 birds per year. At that rate it would take only about 18 hunters to eliminate all the cormorants in the Great Lakes basin in a single year, and with a very few more able to eliminate the species from the entire province. No one hunter could kill that many, but then, while hunters’ numbers are in precipitous decline, there are still a many times more than enough to again eliminate the species in most of Ontario.","In an excellent commentary published by The Toronto Star on December 10, 2018 (see: https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/12/10/why-are-cormorants-in-progressive-conservatives-crosshairs.html) political commentator par excellence, Thomas Walkom, asks a similar, related question, why are cormorants in the crosshairs of Doug Ford’s party, the provincial Progressive Conservatives?","Having a majority in provincial parliament, Ford and his party has free rein to enact regressive laws. The party is neither conservative nor progressive, but they can do what they want, so why do they want to kill cormorants and cause horrific suffering and deaths to their orphaned nestlings? What game species is deliberately and legally shot when it has dependent young? Why hate cormorants?","While the answer to the uninformed minds of Ford’s base would simply be “because cormorants eat all the fish”, meaning fish otherwise available to both sport and commercial anglers, as is well known by those who actually study cormorant diets, it is wrong. I think that inaccurate belief is only part of the answer.",But it is not quite what Walkom asked. We’ll get to that.,"There is often excessive antipathy toward predators, seen by the environmentally illiterate as competitors for what we humans need or want. Among fish-eating species, seals, sealions, porpoises and other cetaceans, sharks and other mammals have been scapegoated – blamed for declines in commercially “harvested” fish stocks. Among native Ontario birds, Ospreys, pelicans, herons, Belted Kingfishers, loons, grebes, mergansers and other species have, at various times, been targeted for organized killing. They are all now protected, to varying degrees, in response to increasing understanding of basic ecological principles.","But none evoke as much sheer detestation as cormorants; they really are hated, to an irrational, visceral degree, by a significant minority of people. It is not all that unusual, especially for people who lived prior to about the mid-twentieth century, before there was much knowledge about wildlife population dynamics and predator-prey interrelationships and the importance of apex predators to biodiversity, to want to kill all predators. And a few species, like wolves, can still too often arouse such levels of irrational fear and hatred.","It has been suggested that some of the excoriation directed against cormorants reflects deep-seated bigotry of the worse kind. The theory points to the fact that cormorants were once called nigger goose in some quarters (you can imagine which) and to a situation in Australia, where there are two small cormorant species very similar in size, shape and diets, but one is black and white while the other is all black, the latter being far less tolerated than the former. Other black birds, such as crows, grackles and starlings, also seem to attract disproportionate dislike, where they dare to be common. “Black” is, as people in support of civil rights have been known to observe, seen as negative, the colour that depends on an absence of light, thus the antheses to what light represents, as symbolized in the word, “enlightenment”, or in religious texts associating light with grace, goodness and God. White pelicans, which eat more fish per bird than any cormorant (because they are bigger; they need more) are, like swans and egrets, more fondly considered.","Maybe, but that didn’t stop assailants from killing both cormorants and American White Pelicans at a mutual nesting colony Manitoba, stomping on eggs and babies, and has not prevented demonization of Mute Swans and Snow Geese, both white.","The “blackness” theory is all too speculative for me and I think the answer is simpler, although not entirely simplistic.","To help understand the hatred, we need a little history.","The species was twice reduced to virtually endangered status in Ontario. The first reduction happened, I theorize, hot on the heels of colonization by European “settlers”. They carried with them guns and a combination of fear and ignorance about the wilderness, which was to be tamed and conquered. Because of their devotion to their nesting duties cormorants are extremely vulnerable to persecution. It’s inconceivable that they would be found from Alaska to Florida and the West Indies, and from Newfoundland to California and Mexico, and yet be absent from the largest source of fresh water fish in the world, quite near the centre of that vast range. As mostly European “pioneers” filled the land, cormorants, and a vast number of other wildlife species, gave way. Cormorants were easily destroyed.","Following the end of the War of 1812, commercial fisheries began in the Great Lakes and no cormorant nest site would have been safe from persecution, happening before qualified naturalists arrived on the scene to record the presence of nesting birds. This led to the oddly absurd belief that cormorants therefore were never present!","But they were, and there are indications of them nesting in Sandusky Bay, Ohio, which is part of Lake Erie, late into the 19th Century. By the time qualified observations were being made, direct evidence of Great Lakes nesting was scarce to absent, east of Lake of the Woods, until some were found in Lake Superior in 1913, where locals said they had nested all along.","The “official” version is that from there they spread eastward, reaching Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River by 1945.","On its website Environment Canada says, “Historically, it is thought that the Double-crested Cormorant did not nest in the Great Lakes. Archaeological excavations in aboriginal settlements have not shown any evidence of the bird. Although cormorants have nested in Lake of the Woods (in northwestern Ontario) for hundreds of years, the first suspected nesting on the Great Lakes did not occur until 1913, at the far western end of Lake Superior. From there colonies spread eastward to Lake Nipigon in the 1920s, to Lake Huron and Georgian Bay in the early 1930s and finally to Lakes Ontario and Erie in the late 1930s (Figure 1: Cormorants first nested on Lake Superior in 1913, and spread eastward to Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River By 1945.”","Environment Canada’s website ignores any evidence contrary to what it says and misstates that there is no archeological evidence of the bird in the Great Lakes prior to then. That is simply not true (their bones have, in fact, been found in kitchen middens – remains of animals eaten by native peoples centuries ago, albeit not often; they are not good to eat) but it promotes the idea that the bird did not historically occur in the Great Lakes, and thus is an intruder, an “invader”, an immigrant, as it were.","Then Minister of what was at the time called the Ministry of Natural Resources, David Ramsay, said, in 2004, that the cormorants were not native, but an “invasive” species. Again, that is not remotely true. That ridiculous claim has since been dropped by the provincial government although it seems still to be believed by some who so thoughtlessly hate cormorants.","Following the end of WWII, DDT was introduced into the environment with disastrous results, as the pesticide bioaccumulated up the food chain, to render several fish-eating bird species unable to produce viable eggs. The same Environment Canada website is probably far more accurate in saying, “The cormorant disappeared as a nesting bird on Lakes Michigan and Superior and only about ten pairs remained on Lake Ontario.”","However, by 1973, recovery was well underway, again.","And there is what is a significant part of the real origin of fear and hatred directed against Double-crested Cormorants. The ecological niche that cormorants occupy was already there, and in fact had increased. Cormorants tend to eat coarse fish species that are abundant, and several such species had newly entered the ecosystem, including the herring-like Alewife, a truly invasive species.","I saw my first cormorants, as a kid, in 1957, and the beach I was standing near, at Presqu’ile Provincial Park, Lake Ontario, was covered in rotting piles of dead Alewives. Alewives’ food consists of plankton and other tiny organisms at or near the base of food chains upon which larger fish depend, along with small fish and other organisms of various other species, including the young of species of interest to anglers.","Alewives spawn at the same time cormorants are feeding, and spawning Alewives are an ideal size for cormorants. As cormorant numbers went up, on average the number of dead and rotting Alewives on the beaches went down, and the kinds of fish that anglers pursue had more food, to their benefit. The return of the cormorants was good news indicating environmental healing.","No one now alive was around when cormorants were here prior to nearly vanishing at the end of the 19th century, and few if anyone alive would recall their growing numbers prior to World War II. Thus, the perception is that the “normal” number of cormorants is what is remembered from our youth, which in many lakes and rivers, would be none at all.","Thus the “norm” to such folks is not what a healthy ecosystem looks like, cormorants, fish and all, but what it looks like when a key species, the cormorant, is endangered or absent. Add to that, a lack of understanding that in naturally evolved predator-prey relationships, prey population size determines how many predators there are, not the other way around.","Currently most water that cormorants could occupy lacks them; most fish cormorants could eat don’t get eaten by them; most islands and headlands where cormorants might nest, they don’t.","However, when and where they do occur, they may do so in large numbers. They are a species that is very “social” and that tends to occur in large concentrations. Large numbers of wildlife is not a sight anyone alive today is used to seeing. We might read about the vast numbers of wildlife that greeted the first European settlers, but we have no memory of them. The vast seabird breeding colonies, the schools of cod so thick they impeded the progress of ships, the massive herds of bison whose sheer weight shook the earth, the unimaginably enormous numbers of Passenger Pigeons eclipsing the sun, the wide flocks of migrating Eskimo Curlews and other shorebirds, the expanses of caribou across the tundra, numbers of deer, bear, moose, waterfowl…and cormorants…gone now, many, including some that were once the most numerous, are extinct, extirpated or endangered.","But some do recover. When a species does occur, even locally, in large numbers, it tends to be perceived as an anomaly, an abomination, an affront to our own self-important domination of an environment we still want to control, to dominate. The number of people in the Greater Toronto Area is more than the number of Double-crested Cormorants continent-wide, and yet Premier Ford thinks there are “too many”.","There is also the “squeamish factor”. With our cellophane-wrapped meat and air-conditioned or gas-heated homes and the support of unprecedented technologies upon which we have rapidly become dependent, we are isolated from the true nature, the texture, the essence of life and life processes. The concentrations of excrement that are so normal and typical a part of any concentration of any species, our own included when modern plumbing is not to be had, offends us. The un-sanitized world is just too “dirty”, it can smell unpleasant; the reality of life and death is disagreeable and disturbing, dangers lurk…an unwelcome intrusion into our technologically barricaded womb of equanimity.","But while I think all of that goes into explaining hatred of cormorants, where it exists, it does not answer Thomas Walkom’s more probing question: why are cormorants in the crosshairs of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives?","The key to the answer is, I believe, embedded in the question. Crosshairs is a reference to shooters, and while we don’t have the “gun culture” to be found in the U.S., it is not entirely missing. Whereas our southern neighbours have the National Rifle Association, the NRA, a major political force down there, in Ontario we have the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, OFAH. Both organizations share a problem and do so with the respective governments of the jurisdictions in which they operate and with various business interests.","That problem is a precipitous decline in hunters. Hunters pay license fees that go into government coffers, and membership fees and donations that fund the NRA and OFAH and payments to outfitters, and equipment suppliers such as gun, ammo and hunting gear producers and retailers. It’s a symbiotic relationship of intertwined and interdependent interests.","I can’t think that the more knowledgeable of OFAH’s advisors really are as ignorant of ecology as their anti-cormorant indicates, but they know they depend on the hook and bullet fraternity for",by CBS 2 News Staff,"Friday, October 12th 2018",An Idaho Fish and Game commissioner who emailed photos of himself posing with a family of baboons he shot and killed during a recent African hunting trip has led to former commissioners asking for his resignation.

Lawmakers voted last week to put the amendment on the Nov. 6 general election ballot as a referendum.","The bill passed with bipartisan — though not unanimous — support, the General Assembly’s website shows. Among those voting for the amendment were Republican lawmakers Sen. Bill Cook and Rep. Bob Steinburg. Area Democratic Rep. Howard Hunter III of Hertford County had excused absences for votes on the amendment, but wrote in an email Wednesday that he saw no harm in it.","If passed by the voters, the amendment would be a win for hunting and fishing groups, including the Eastern Carolina Houndsmen Alliance. In an interview Friday, alliance President Terry Morse said his organization has members throughout the state — including bear hunters in the western mountains — and it’s endorsed the amendment as preserving a heritage that predates the state itself.","Asked why the amendment is necessary, given the wide popularity of hunting and fishing in the state, Morse suggested some animal rights and humane societies might seek to limit hunting in the future. He claims the amendment is a proactive step to not only protect hunting and fishing, but preserve them as conservation tools.","Would the amendment’s guarantee of a right to hunt and fish force major changes to state laws and regulations, or otherwise have unintended consequences? Morse and other supporters say no.",The amendment’s text specifically states the right to hunt and fish are subject to state laws and regulations to “promote wildlife conservation and management” and “preserve the future of fishing and hunting.”,"The amendment also states it shall not “be construed to modify any provision of law relating to trespass, property rights, or eminent domain.”","Morse said the amendment preserves the authority of the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission to regulate hunting and fishing, including by setting annual limits on how many animals can be killed. That’s important, because preserving the heritage of hunting and fishing requires maintaining game populations, he explained.","Similarly, N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission Executive Director Gordon Myers said Friday that the amendment would not change the commission’s authority. He said the commission would also still have authority to ban hunting or fishing specific animals, if it determined their numbers were already too low.","Though the amendment preserves authority to regulate hunting and fishing for conservation, and to protect property rights, it does call at least one hunting regulation into question: restrictions on Sunday hunting. In deference to religious services, current state law restricts hunting on Sunday mornings, the use of hunting dogs, and hunting within 500 yards of a place of worship.","In an interview Thursday, Steinburg confirmed that lawmakers had debated, but apparently not settled, the question of how the amendment would affect Sunday hunting restrictions.","“That’s one of those things that, if it’s challenged in court, it will be interesting to see how it turns out,” Steinburg said.","Notably, the General Assembly’s website shows that state Rep. Pricey Harrison, D-Guilford, filed amendments to S677 that would have stipulated hunting rights were subject to laws and regulations relating to public safety and public peace, “including limitations on Sunday hunting.” The amendments also would have allowed hunting to be affected in “regulation of commercial activities.” Both amendments failed.","In supporting the amendment, Steinburg said he did so because it seeks to ensure that “extreme environmental groups” or liberal judges won’t wrongly infringe on rights to hunt and fish.","Cook also strongly supported the amendment in an email Thursday, noting it would “bring North Carolina in line with 21 other states that already guarantee this right in their constitutions.”","Cook also noted the amendment enjoys strong support from hunting-related groups, including the National Rifle Association, Delta Waterfowl, Safari Club International, the Eastern Carolina Houndsmen Alliance, and others.","Cook also said the most recent state data found sportsmen and women spent $2.3 billion on hunting and fishing in 2011, supporting more than 35,000 local jobs.","Contacted on Friday, a spokeswoman for the N.C. Sierra Club said the environmental group had not taken a position on the amendment yet. The club’s statewide leadership is still considering it, she said.",,"You don’t hear all that much about 104-year-olds, perhaps since they’re usually squirreled away in some nursing home ‘for their own protection’ by then. Or perhaps because the average human life expectancy is 79.3 in the U.S. (for both sexes combined), while in Sierra Leone it’s still only 50.1 and the longest-lived people in the world these days, the Japanese, live an average of 83.7. But ironically I happened across articles about not one, but two century+4-year-olds while leafing through the news today.","By now we’ve probably all heard of Australian scientist David Goodall, who decided to spare himself any future suffering and make the long trip to Switzerland to humanely end his own life (just as you would a beloved old dog or cat who had outlived his or her ability to know joy in life). “Why Would Anyone Oppose This 104-Year-Old Man’s Decision to Die With Dignity?” asks, in an article from the Friendly Atheist, which goes on to say:","‘Goodall didn’t want to travel to Switzerland for the procedure, but it was the only option for him since his home nation of Australia forbids assisted suicide in all instances. He made sure everyone knew about his frustrations.","“I greatly regret having reached that age; I would much prefer to be 20 or 30 years younger,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. during the [104th birthday] festivities in April. When asked whether he had a nice birthday, he replied: “No, I’m not happy. I want to die. … It’s not sad, particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.”","“My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights, including the right of assisted suicide,” the 104-year-old man added.’","Meanwhile, in what turned out to be the NRA’s American Hunter website, I spotted an article from December 27, 2017 entitled “America’s Oldest Hunter Bags Third Deer of the Season at 104 Years Old.”","Well, bully for him, the old codger got to go out and kill something—actually, three somethings—on what will surely be one of his last seasons of life!",From the NRA article:,"‘Congratulations to Clyde Roberts on another successful season, and best wishes in the seasons to come. His recent 8-pointer marks the 11th deer he has taken since turning 100 years of age!’","By Miranda Green, CNN","Updated 3:25 PM ET, Fri September 15, 2017",Washington (CNN)Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke signed an order Friday morning aiming to expand access for hunters and fishers to public lands and monuments.,How Do You Sleep At Night?,"Bec and Sharna don’t look like the kind of people you’d call “psychotic murderers”, “disgusting whores” or “killers with a sick fetish”.[… but they are.]","They’re normal, friendly women. They’ve got normal jobs. They live in normal, regional towns.",Bec and Sharna,"But when killing wild animals on the weekend is what you call fun, they’re the kind of names they’ve come to expect.","Between them, Bec and Sharna have killed enough animals to pretty much fill a zoo. Deer, a zebra, a giraffe, a mountain lion, a pigeon, foxes, kangaroos, impalas, baboons, a feral cat, a cow and a wild dog have all found themselves in the crosshairs of Sharna’s rifle or the target of Bec’s bow.","Some end up on their dinner table, some in their dog’s bowls, and some end up hanging in their living rooms.",Sharna’s living room,"“In a way it’s a trophy, it’s a memento of the hunt,” Sharna told Sarah McVeigh for the ABC’s new podcast, How Do You Sleep At Night?","“Each of those have their own story and for us, we don’t want to see any of it go to waste either. That’s probably the best use of those skins.”","Hunting has been part of her life for so long, Bec can’t even remember the first time she fired a gun. A sixth-generation hunter; it’s in her blood.",“It was the same as other kids going and playing footy. We went hunting. It was just something that was done.,“I learnt really quickly that when I went to school that not all families were like my family. We ate a lot of homekill meat; I grew up on a sheep farm so Dad always slaughtered our own lambs.,"“Sometimes that meant that we even ate our pets,” Bec says, remembering her pet lamb Blinky who eventually ended up on her plate.","“I remember friends coming over after school and they were like, ‘What the hell is going on here?’ and then I started to realise that that wasn’t how other families did it.”","Bec and Sharna are both licensed hunters and only hunt animals permitted by local authorities. They both insist hunting, for them, is more than a hobby.","I don’t call hunting a sport, I call hunting a lifestyle.”",Sarah McVeigh spent five days with Bec and Sharna in the Victorian High Country to understand how they tick and why they get satisfaction from killing animals.,"“Hunting is a challenge. And sitting around the campfire is fun,” Sharna says. “Pushing myself when it’s freezing cold up that mountain, that’s the fun part. Taking the actual shot is something where, you’re in the moment, there’s that adrenaline rush.",“I think they say it’s the same chemical release as kissing and that sort of thing. You’re getting that big rush of endorphins.”,Critics of Bec and Sharna – mostly on their public posts on Facebook – don’t buy their argument. They call Bec and Sharna serial killers; they call them sick; they say Bec and Sharna should turn their weapons on themselves.,"“Put a rifle up your c***,” someone wrote, “and pull the trigger”.",Sharna,"Bec and Sharna understand why people are quick to judge hunters. But they say criticism tends to be clouded by false assumptions, and – unless their critics are vegans – embedded in hypocrisy.","“They think we go out there to torture animals where we don’t,” Sharna says. “They don’t understand what we do. That’s definitely an aspect of why people dislike us so much.”","But Bec and Sharna’s reasoning for hunting boils down to a few things: they enjoy hunting for fitness, they eat the animals they’ve killed, and they only kill animals that are a sustainable resource.","“I’d much rather know where my meat is coming from,” Sharna says. “I don’t want to just walk into the supermarket, pick it up off the shelf and not know where it’s come from.","“There’s a genuine respect for the animal. There’s no regret [when we kill]. But there’s… it’s very hard to describe. It’s not remorse, it’s not regret.",There’s just this solemn moment where you thank the life you’ve just taken.”,Bec,"Bec and Sharna often go back to this existential point: when it comes to hunting in the animal kingdom, there is no hierarchy. Apart from endangered or rare species, no life is worth more than another. Squishing a spider is the same as shooting a baboon in South Africa – where they are a sustainable resource, Bec says.","Bec shot a giraffe in South Africa, and the animal was butchered that day for the locals to eat.",Bec in South Africa,"“The amount of food that this guy provided for the local community is possibly still being enjoyed,” Bec says.",Bec says none of the criticism she’s received online has made her “second-guess” her hobby and lifestyle choice.,"But for Sharna, one comment caught her off guard.","A commenter once took issue with Sharna’s taxidermy animals. “That’s what a serial killer does, a serial killer collects tokens,” the commenter told Sharna.","“For me I was like, ‘I want to know what separates me from a serial killer’ and that’s a pretty big thing to think about within yourself. That comment made me sit down and think about that.”","So what does separate Sharna and Bec from, say, Ivan Milat? Is it just the victims they choose?","“There’s plenty of things,” Sharna says.",“I’m a nurse and I have compassion for people. Obviously serial killers don’t think about their actions – they’re sociopaths. So there’s quite a bit that separates me from a serial killer.,You wouldn’t be here with me if I was a serial killer.”,Sarah McVeigh with Bec and Sharna,"Both Bec and Sharna are careful about calling killing “fun”. They insist the act of hunting – the whole experience – is fun, but pulling the trigger is not.","“If I were to say that to pull the trigger is fun, the way people view me might change,” Sharna admits.","“You take the shot, pull the trigger, and if that animal falls over straight away, hasn’t really known what’s going on, that’s a success. So you do get excited about it, and it is a fun activity.”",Sharna and Bec know it’s hard for people to understand how killing could be fun.,"I always say this to people… before you decide that you hate this and it’s shit and that we shouldn’t do it, come and give it a go.","“Instead of just sitting behind a keyboard and telling me that what I’m doing is wrong, come and see it.”",https://nypost.com/2018/01/22/dog-shoots-owner-to-death-in-freak-hunting-accident/,By Natalie O’Neill,"January 22, 2018 | 3:22pm",A Russian hunter was shot dead by his own dog when the excited pooch hopped up on his lap and tapped his shotgun — which discharged into his gut.,"The freak accident struck while Sergei Terekhov, 64, and his brother were hunting rabbits in the remote Saratov region, according to reports Monday.","Terekhov’s double-barrelled shotgun was resting on his knee when his Estonian Hound bounded towards him and bumped the weapon with his paw, causing it to go off, according to the local news site Region 64 and other outlets.","“The weapon rested on his knee, with the butt facing down and the barrel pointing towards his stomach,” investigator Alexander Galanin told the site.","The investigative committee later told Newsweek Terekhov was holding the Soviet Toz-3, which discharged after the pooch darted from a car and hopped up onto him.",Terekhov’s brother called an ambulance but he died on the way to a hospital.,"Terekhov was experienced hunter with a license, Galanin said. “Everything was in order.

Lots range from Iberian red deer and Pyrenean chamois to Australian water buffalo and African elephants.,"The description of the 10-day Alaska Brown Bear and Black Bear hunt, which has a starting price of $75,150, reads: “This all-inclusive hunt is an outstanding option for hunters who want an all-in-one luxury hunting experience…in amazing areas boasting the highest density of bears in the world.”",It adds: “Method of take is hunters’ choice.”,"The Ultimate Hunters’ Market has been condemned by animal rights activists, amid a renewed focus on the ethics of big game hunting after SCI member and US dentist Walter Palmer killed Cecil in Zimbabwe last year.","Wendy Higgins, of Humane Society International said: “The auction site reads like a grotesque killing-for-kicks catalogue, in which the lives of the precious wildlife are sold to the highest bidder so that they can be slaughtered for fun.","“It is a tragic indictment on our society that, despite the global outrage over Cecil the Lion’s pointless killing, this scale of trophy hunting is still going on,” said Wendy Higgins, of Humane Society International.",League Against Cruel Sports chief executive Eduardo Goncalves added: “It beggars belief that there are still people who are excited by the prospect of slaughtering an animal for target practice and turning it into a trophy.”,"The Safari Club International (SCI) is expected to raise more than $2.5 million from auctioning the mammal hunts alone, which have been provided from various hunt organisers.",The club runs the convention annually and it provides the majority of its income – most of which is used to lobby Washington.,Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 682 other followers,Follow,Click image for info

"Posted by: mindoversports on: October 5, 2007","A few years ago I appeared on a call-in sports talk radio show and made the comment that there really isn’t any such thing as a motivating coach since no coach can motivate his or her players. Inspire, yes. But not motivate. One coach who was listening called in and read me the riot act insisting that he was a great motivator. Once he calmed down I explained to him that motivation must come from within, and what I’ve found over the years is that the higher an athlete’s feelings of self-worth (self-esteem) the more motivated he or she is. Athletes with low self-esteem are not motivated. But what a coach can do is create an environment on his or her team that fosters high self-esteem. This often involves turning teams into support groups so that team members can discuss their personal issues with each other. Once they’ve aired their feelings and issues, they will then begin to feel better about themselves and will automatically become more motivated. This can also be accomplished when coaches have an open door policy and are always available to listen to their athletes’ issues and problems without being judgmental. Once I explained this to my “call-in coach” he agreed and told me that he fell into the latter category; that his door was always open to his athletes. And of course, these are the coaches who are most successful with their teams, assuming their teams have the skill level to be successful.","Which brings me to a discussion of a new book that has just been published entitled: “The Motivational Breakthrough: 6 Secrets for Turning On the Tuned-Out Child” and unfortunately, I couldn’t disagree with the author, Rick Lavoie, more. Mr. Lavoie maintains that if you want to motivate kids in school, you need to use the six P’s: Praise, Power, Projects, People, Prizes and Prestige. From my perspective, if you want to motivate kids in school, especially those who are highly unmotivated, you need to do what I’ve described above as applied to sports teams. That is, put them into support groups and allow them to talk about issues in their personal lives and what is going on at home. Once they open up and discuss their feelings and emotions in a support group setting with their peers, they will enhance their own feelings of self-worth and will automatically become more motivated. There’s a correlation between High Self-Esteem and High Motivation and Low Self-Esteem and Low Motivation. You have to work from the inside out, not the outside in. And the same goes for so-called “Motivational Speakers” who I believe are a hoax.",Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:,You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

During a Tuesday afternoon appearance on popular sports-talk radio show The Ride with JMV, Glass said the Charleston Southern game will cost IU $500,000, plus $250,000 in extra expenses.","Glass told IndyStar he agreed with Pete Garcia, his counterpart at FIU, that this weekend's canceled game will be made up, as it is part of a larger series that will also see IU return to Miami in the future as well.","The payout for the date with Florida International is $800,000, but Glass that won't be paid out until the game is played in 2024.","IU Athletic Director Fred Glass acted quickly to refill his football team's schedule after the FIU game was canceled Monday night. Glass was intent on adding a home game for both financial and competitive reasons, as the Hoosiers only had six on the schedule this season to begin with. The department relies on the sizable gate obtained from home football games, and adding an FCS opponent makes coach Tom Allen's path to six wins and bowl eligibility all the more navigable.","IU season and mini-season ticket holders who already held tickets and/or parking passes for the Florida International game will have replacements mailed to the address the athletic department has on file, per the release.",• MORE: Allen embraces QB competition as Ramsey shines,Those fans who purchased single-game tickets and parking passes for FIU will need to have them exchanged for the Charleston Southern game.

"Miami, FL – Not every story has a happy ending, and not every tale of persistence and hard work ends in victory. The Miami FC was put together to challenge the current status quo of the U.S. Soccer system. Riccardo Silva wanted to prove that a lower division team could rise up and compete with MLS teams, and be successful in doing so. Without a structure of promotion and relegation, the only way to prove that is in the U.S. Open Cup.","We all remember how the OB’s fell short of their goal (no pun intended, maybe) last season. Follow that up with the Miami FC having to drop from 2nd division, due to the collapse of NASL, to the 4th division NPSL. Also, through all this, FC had to replace their coach and numerous players from last season. Fast forward to the beginning of the 2018 NPSL season.

Tyler Ruthven then received two straight yellow cards, and was sent off in 33’. United equalized in 3’ of extra time in the 1st half. The match would end in a draw, but in total there were 10 bookings – seven yellows and three reds. Winless, yet undefeated, both teams would then begin preparations for their U.S. Open Cup campaigns. FC won their play-in game vs. FC Miami City, and then came out victorious in the 1st round vs. Red Force FC.

In the 17th minute, Dylan Mares received a cross from Ariel Martinez and sent it to the back of the net. However, right before the half ended, Kris Tyrpak would earn himself a straight red card, losing his cool, and stomping on an opposing United player. Now down to 10 men, all FC had to do was take a page out of José Mourinho’s book of public transportation and park the bus, but David Ochoa was probably watching Speed to get ready for the match. Is he Keanu Reeves or Sandra Bullock? Either way, FC’s defense looked lost. Ochoa scored two goals – one in 49’ and another in 52’. The OB’s now had to pressure up top in order to get back in the match. United would take advantage of FC’s lack of bodies on D, creating many opportunities, but Daniel Vega kept FC within striking distance. Martinez and Chavez would go on to create various scoring opportunities but were not able to capitalize. In the 3rd minute of extra time in the 2nd half, Victor Pelae sent a dagger into the hopes of the Miami FC faithful by scoring a goal that killed any notion of a comeback.

"Razer, the gaming hardware company that went public in Hong Kong last year, is resuming its investment strategy after it led a $3.3 million deal for Australia-based Esports Mogul.","Esports Mogul is, as the name suggests, focused on e-sports. The company operates a platform for organizing e-sports competitions — called Mogul Arena — and a gaming news website. The firm is focused on Asia and Latin America and it went public in Australia via a reverse listing that raised it $7 million.","The new money will go towards developing Mogul Arena for mobile, and funding user acquisition and monetization pushes, Esports Mogul said.","Razer already works with Esports Mogul, and now this deal will increase the collaboration which will focus on integrating Razer’s payment system, which itself was created by the recent acquisition of MOL, according to both companies.","Others in the round include Singapore’s Cloud Alliance, which develops software systems for gamers. It recently raised $15 million from an ICO and it said it plans to work more closely with Esports Mogul and Razer going forward.","Esports Mogul said the round was over-subscribed, with existing investors and local Australian institutions also taking part. The deal is priced at AU$0.018 per share, which represents a 20.55 percent discount on the company’s volume-weighted average share price over the last 15 days. Esports Mogul shares were priced just below $0.002 when it joined the ASX in late 2016.",Note: The original version of this story has been updated to correct the share prices mentioned.
"With Ashley Young, Gary Cahill and Jamie Vardy announcing their exits from international football, Gareth Southgate was expected to make a few interesting changes to this squad. However, 18 of his 23 World Cup players retained their places. Southgate, in his press conference, explained how he felt the lack of competitive matches since the World Cup meant there was little need to make too many changes to his squad. He also bemoaned the lack of game time England players were getting in the Premier League. This season, England’s share of all Premier League players has fallen from 33% to just 30%.","Jack Butland’s decision to remain at Stoke in the Championship was considered carefully by Southgate, who felt the shot-stopper would “find it more difficult to retain his place”, despite a distinct lack of competition from English starting goalkeepers in the Premier League. However, one goalkeeper who does fit that bill is Southampton’s Alex McCarthy – a product of Reading’s academy. Able to dislodge the now long-gone Fraser Forster as ‘Saints’’ number one, McCarthy impressed last season as Southampton avoided relegation under Mark Hughes. The keeper has replaced Nick Pope from the World Cup squad and could make his England debut in the coming international break.","21-year-old Joe Gomez is back, after the injury that kept him out this summer, whilst the ever-dependable duo of Harry Maguire and John Stones retain their places. James Tarkowski, with two headed goals in three Premier League games with Burnley, returns to complete the centre-back list. Danny Rose, Kieran Trippier, Kyle Walker and Trent Alexander-Arnold are the World Cup’s returning fullbacks, while Manchester United’s Luke Shaw has impressed so much in the early weeks of the season to fully merit a recall. After such a testing few years, it will be a great prospect to see him back in the England fold.","England’s midfield is unchanged from the World Cup, apart from a return for the effervescent Adam Lallana. Ross Barkley, Jonjo Shelvey and Jack Cork failed to make the England returns they wanted, despite all enjoying good starts to the season. In addition, Phil Foden and James Maddison, of Manchester City and Leicester City, have been called up to England’s youth sides, instead of Gareth Southgate’s seniors.","In attack, under-21 stars Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Tammy Abraham and Dominic Solanke have all been snubbed through a lack of first-team club football. Daniel Sturridge and Callum Wilson can consider themselves unlucky to have been left out. Jamie Vardy’s so-called ‘retirement’ has not translated into a free spot for a new striker. Instead, Southgate called up more defenders. Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck and Marcus Rashford are the chosen forwards.",The stepping aside of three senior England players means Gareth Southgate’s Three Lions are now even less experienced than they were at the World Cup. The current 23 have an average of just 21 caps and 2 goals. Only two of the 23 have scored more than three England goals. Raheem Sterling is the most capped player; he’s 23 years of age.,"There are undoubtedly advantages of having a young side – we saw them as England reached the semi-finals this summer. However, that is only possible with good leadership. Gareth Southgate talked a lot during the World Cup about his ‘leadership team’. This was, and still will be, a group of five or six players with certain leadership abilities. Included players are the likes of Harry Kane, Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph. The role that these players play, both on and off the pitch, is key if England are to pick up where they left off, this month.",This was a loyal squad selection from the manager.

"The MV Agusta F4 is a four-cylinder sport bike made by MV Agusta from 1999 until 2018. It was the motorcycle that launched the resurrection of the brand in 1998. The F4 was created by motorcycle designer Massimo Tamburini at CRC (Cagiva Research Center), following his work on the Ducati 916. The F4 has single-sided swingarm, large front forks (49 or 50 mm (1.9 or 2.0 in) in diameter) and traditional MV Agusta red and silver livery. The F4 is also one of the few production superbikes to have a hemispherical chamber 4 valves per cylinder engine.","The F4 engine is a liquid cooled inline four cylinder four-stroke with two overhead camshafts (DOHC), 16 radial valves, electronic multipoint injection, induction discharge electronic ignition, with engine displacements of 749.5 cc (45.74 cu in), 998 cc (60.9 cu in), and 1,078 cc (65.8 cu in). The engine was derived from the 1990–1992 Ferrari Formula One engine. Early in the design process Ferrari engineers assisted in the development of the engine. MV (Cagiva at the time) quickly deviated from the Ferrari design, but they kept one important feature, the radial valves. The F4 engine is unique in the sense that it is the only radial valved motorcycle engine currently in production.","The F4 Tamburini, F4 Veltro, and F4 CC models are equipped with variable length intake ducts known as the ""TSS"" system. The ""TSS"" system is designed to increase torque in the low to midrange, while still allowing for max. horsepower at the top of the rev range (usually two mutually exclusive properties of an engine). The ""TSS"" system has two positions, it is not able to vary the height of the intake ducts continuously. ""TSS"" is able to lower peak torque from the 10000 rpm to 9000 rpm while maintaining maximum power. This system debuted on the F4 Tamburini and was lauded by independent motorcycling publications such as Australian Motorcycle News.","The first F4 model released to the public was the F4 750 Serie Oro on May 1999. Only 300 examples were produced. Many parts such as the swingarm, frame side plates and wheels were made from magnesium. These magnesium parts were anodized gold for consistency with the name 'Oro' (Italian for gold). All painted parts, such as fairings, seat cover, front mud guard and even the fuel tank and air box are made of carbon. It's only by using these materials that the weight could be kept under 181kg (400 lb) which is only beaten by the F4 Veltro. The specially for MV Agusta developed Showa fork has fast detach axle clamps. The six piston (front) and 4 piston (rear) brake calipers are made by Nissin.","The mass production model, the F4 750 S (S = ""Strada""), was released in 1999, and was essentially the same bike as the F4 750 Oro but with aluminium pieces in place of magnesium. Both of these bikes produced 126 hp (94 kW) 101.78 rear horsepower, with a 13300 rpm redline. Top speed is estimated at 170 mph (273 km/h) @ 12800 rpm, 0–100 km/h estimated at 3.1 seconds, quarter mile 10.98 seconds @ 131 mph (211 km/h). The F4 750 uses a 49 mm Showa front fork and Sachs rear suspension.","The F4 750 also comes in a 1+1 (Biposto) model, which has a pillion for a passenger.","Introduced in 2000, as a 2001 model. Available only in the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog, ""silver book"". Virtually identical to the F4 750 S except for a special brass plate with the Neiman Marcus logo stamped on the triple clamp. There were only 10 available through the Christmas Book and with each purchase, Neiman Marcus included VIP tickets to the International Superbike Classic at Laguna Seca Raceway followed by one day of California Superbike School conducted by Keith Code.","In 2002, the F4 750 Evo 02 model was released. The major improvement to this model was the addition of 11 hp (8.2 kW), for a total of 137 hp (102 kW). In 2003, the F4 Evo 03 was released, which was mostly a cosmetic upgrade along with unique spark plugs.","The F4 750 Senna was also released in 2002 along with the Evo 02 model 0-60 2.9 quarter mile 10.7 @ 135. Built purely to raise money for the Instituto Ayrton Senna, a charity founded by Ayrton Senna to aid the children and young people of Brazil, the Senna was a limited production run of 300 bikes like the Oro. The Senna shared the 136 hp (101 kW) engine of the Evo 02 but with a higher redline of 13900 rpm, and top speed estimated at 175 mph (282 km/h) @ 12750 rpm. The Senna also had some suspension upgrades and some carbon fiber bodywork.","The F4 750 SPR was released in 2004 and was intended to be the final evolution on the F4 750 platform. It had an improved 146 hp (109 kW) engine, (13,900 rpm redline, polished ports, HC pistons) matte grey race livery, some carbon fiber bodywork (front fender, chain guards, air ducts covers) and Marzzochi 50 mm forks. The F4 750 SR was released after the SPR, and used the same frame an F4S (Showa forks, no carbon parts) but the same engine of SPR version. Both the SPR and SR were limited production runs of 300 bikes and had a top speed estimated at 180+ mph @ 13,900, and a quarter mile time of 10.4 @ 139 mph. The SR was released in the traditional red/silver livery of MV with a color coordinated red front fender and a bronze Arrow exhaust system. It also has a white gauge face, different from the standard yellow, which displays Agostini's signature in red. It also has the signature silver star rims and SR plate placed on the steering head.","Like the F4 750 and the Oro, the new F4 1000 product line began with a special edition F4 1000 called the F4 AGO in 2005. The F4 AGO came with a special graphics prominently displaying the number ""1"" in a yellow oval in reference to MV Agusta's racing heritage and rider Giacomo Agostini. Only 300 bikes were produced.","The first mass-produced F4 1000, the F4 1000 S, was released in 2005 and came with a 166-horsepower (122 kW) engine 142 rear horsepower. The F4 1000 S comes equipped with a 50 mm Marzocchi front upside down fork and Sachs rear suspension. A 1+1 version adds a pillion for a passenger. Expect 0-60 in 2.7 seconds, the quarter mile in 9.95 seconds @ 144 mph, and a top speed estimated at 300 km/h (190 mph).","The F4 Tamburini is a special edition of the F4 1000 S released in 2005. It was the first F4 to be equipped with the Torque Shift System (TSS), which varies the length of the intake trumpets with speed in order to provide optimum torque at low and high engine speeds. Engine output was a claimed 128 kilowatts (172 hp) and claimed top speed was 190.6 mph (306.7 km/h). All the bodywork was carbon fiber except the fuel tank. Only 300 were produced. The bike is named after its designer Massimo Tamburini.","The second mass-produced F4 1000, the F4 1000 R and F4 1000R CRC Gold limited edition, was released in 2006 and came with a 174-horsepower - 175 horsepower and 308 km/h for limited edition (128 kW) engine. The F4 1000 R also has upgraded Brembo Monobloc radial brakes, forged black Brembo wheels, a carbon-nitride coated Marzocchi upside down fork and an upgraded Sachs rear shock absorber (compression & rebound damping adjustable in high & low speed range). The F4 1000 R engine does not utilize the TSS system. A 1+1 (Biposto) version is available that adds a pillion for a passenger. In August 2006 an F4 1000 R was used to set a record for the fastest production class 1000 cc motorcycle of over 185.882 mph (299.148 km/h) at Bonneville Salt Flats.","The F4 1000 Senna is a special edition of the F4 1000 R released in 2006. It is similar to the 2002 F4 750 Senna in spirit, but has some changes to the paint scheme and an alcantara seat. This model comes with the 174 horsepower (128 kW) engine and has also the upgraded Brembo Goldline radial brakes, forged silver Marchesini wheels, a 50 mm titanium-nitride coated Marzocchi upside down fork and a lightweight Sachs racing rear suspension (in high & low speed range adjustable rebound and compression damping). Only 300 were produced.","The F4 Veltro comes in two models, the F4 Veltro Strada (road) and F4 Veltro Pista (race). Ninety-nine examples of the Strada were produced, as well as 23 examples of the Pista. As is standard for a race modified motorcycle, the Pista is not equipped with headlights. The Veltro models engines feature the TSS system originally found on the F4 Tamburini. These are considered by many to be the most race-oriented F4's available.","The Veltro Strada is equipped with a full complement of carbon fiber (fairings, tail, airbox, mud guards, fenders, air ducts, heat shield) and magnesium frame plates.","In addition to the parts found on the Veltro Strada, the Veltro Pista is equipped with a lightened frame, oversized radiator, carbon fiber fuel tank, and a magnesium triple clamp and swingarm.","This model F4 1000 R 312 was released in late 2007 and in 2008. It is identical to the F4 1000 R except for 9 hp more powerful engine, for a total of 183 hp (136 kW) and 115 N·m (85 lbf·ft) torque. This is due to 30 mm titanium intake valves, modified camshafts and 48 mm throttle bodies. For 2009 MV Agusta crossed the F4 1000R 312 with the 1,078cc F4CC to make the F4 1078RR 312 that made 190 hp (142 kW). Then in 2010 they released the final year for the 312 the limited edition F4 1078 RR 312 Edizione finale. The ""312"" in the name refers to the bike's claimed top speed of 312 km/h (193.868 mph). Italy's Motociclismo magazine verified MV Agusta's claim, achieving a top speed of 193.24 mph (310.99 km/h) at the Nardò Ring. Sport Rider did a in depth review with the F4 1000R 312 and the brother the $120,000 1,078cc F4CC; at the eight-mile oval at the Honda Proving Center of California with perfect conditions with cool temperatures and no wind, they did a number of runs and experimented with body positioning for aerodynamics and were only able to achieve a top speed of 185.4 mph (298.4 km/h). They also stated that to make up for the 8 mph shortfall a significant horsepower increase was needed. The 1,078cc F4CC that has more horsepower 14 hp more,163.7 hp (122 kW) @ 12,500 rpm (rear wheel) was only able to achieve a 189.1 mph (304.3 km/h) top speed.","The F4 CC, named after Claudio Castiglioni, the Managing Director of MV Agusta, was released in late 2006. The F4 CC has 163.7 hp (122 kW) @ 12,500 rpm (rear wheel) and has a price tag of $120,000. The engine is a 1,078 cc larger capacity edition with valves, crank and piston rods made from titanium based on the F4 1000 R engine combined with the TSS (Torque Shift System). It is one of the most exclusive motorcycles in the world (100 examples). The F4 CC uses the 1078cc engine, which is a 'long stroke' version of the 312 engine, the extra engine capacity being gained by use of a longer crankshaft stroke. This design change allowed the engine tuning to bring the maximum torque delivered to be at a low 8,200 revs, instead of 10,200, as with earlier engines.","The F4 Claudio, named after Claudio Castiglioni, was released in November 2018 at EICMA. It is a limited edition model based on the F4 RC and marks the last update that will be given to the F4 series due to the Euro4 emissions laws. It shares many of the features seen on the MV Agusta model that competes in the World Superbike Championship. The engine has titanium connecting rods and the crankshaft has been specifically designed and balanced, and the combustion chamber has radially-set valves. In track set-up, claimed maximum power is rated at 158 kW (212 hp; 215 PS) @ 13,600 rpm, with a peak torque of 115 N·m (85 lbf·ft) @ 9,300 rpm. In standard road-legal set-up, maximum power still rated at 153 kW (205 hp; 208 PS).","The F4 Claudio uses dual exit titanium SC-Project racing exhaust system with a dedicated control unit. There is a wide range of electronics with four maps on offer, which can be selected instantaneously via the racing push-buttons. The braking system includes Brembo Stilema 4-piston Monobloc radial calipers with dual 320 mm (13 in) front disc brakes, and Öhlins shock absorbers.","The extensive use of carbon fiber has been used to keep the bike's weight low, including a full carbon fiber fairing and lightweight carbon wheels. The weight figure stands at 174.5 kg (385 lb) dry with the race kit on and 183 kg (403 lb) in street trim. The bolts and screws are made from titanium, with CNC-machined aluminium alloys used extensively on functional components such as the triple clamp, height-adjustable footpegs, brake and clutch levers, and brake fluid reservoir plugs and filler cap. The F4 Claudio is limited to 100 bikes, with the price starting from $83,000."

"- Colin, is this a smart move by Oakland?","- I'm not sure if it is. 10 years is a long time to be away from any industry. I mean, just-- just think about tech in our lives. 10 years ago, they just introduced the GPS. OK? The GPS is the 400th biggest tech tool in my life now. The game has changed. Tight ends weren't used as much 10 years ago. We had fullbacks. We had huddles. People are more mobile now, it's hard to retain your staff. The culture of football-- baseball tends to look in the rear view mirror. Football is the opposite. There's a bravado that you pick up stuff first, you change stuff. There's been a lot of changes.",Wasn't Joe Gibbs gone a few years? He came back and he really struggled to adapt. I think it's a real risky move here.,"- I think it's a reach when you look at what they're willing to give up and what they're going to pay him to be their next head coach. And a guy-- and I don't like to use the term overrated, because he does have a Super Bowl behind his name, but that Super Bowl came with Tony Dungy's defense running the Tampa 2, and as much as he gets credit for developing quarterbacks, he won that Super Bowl with Brad Johnson, who was a game manager at the position.",- He was.,"- If you're the Raiders, and you're willing to give up ownership, to do all these-- to move all these parts, to bring Jon Gruden there, why didn't you go after, maybe, Pete Carroll? Why not Sean Payton? If you're offering this type, you're backing up the truck, why don't you go and shoot the true home run of somebody who's been in the league--",- Yes.,"- --in recent, recent years and had success there? Because I think if you're willing to do that, those coaches would pick up the phone and listen.",- Yeah.,"- My answer is juice. I mean, Gruden's got juice. You know? He reinvented himself on ESPN. Remember, when you get fired, it isn't it because everyone likes you. I mean, the players don't like you, your coaches don't like you, the fans don't like you. No one likes you. And then he got into ESPN. Now all of a sudden he's the quarterback guru. I don't know if he ever coached a young quarterback in his whole career. But now he's got all the answers for those young quarterbacks right there, and they all love him because he's got stick, you know?",- Yeah.,"- When he's in there he's got that whole deal he's got. So right now, I think that the Raiders are looking at it as a guy who loved Oakland when he was there, could sell tickets. I mean, who knows? He might have a part ownership of a casino when they get to Las Vegas. We don't know what they're giving him.",- Yeah.,"- I'm sure if he's going there, they're offering him the moon. The question is what truly are they getting in return?",- That's a very good question.,"- Well, if I'm him, I would do it. If they're giving me-- I don't know. I really don't believe the ownership stuff. I think that's-- that's poppycock. I'm not buying into it. But it's been done before. Dick Vermeil showed that you can take some years off. He was around the game the whole time, calling the games, and he's connected to the game. You watch him, he does all that-- Gruden's camp and quarterbacks-- he's friends with the guy. We heard that he's got a great relationship with the quarterback out there and Carr.","It's a great situation to do it. If he has ever, ever considered actually coming out of retirement and coaching, this is the best situation for him. Because he-- it is primed and ready. This has got to be a coaching dream. And Davis, the owner, he loves him. He loves him.",- You know what signalled this might really be happening? When Tampa announced that Cutter was staying.,- Mhm.,- Mhm.,"- Why all of a sudden? All of a sudden, Tampa is closed. Tampa is going to open. That's where he's going. He's going to Tampa, he lives in Tampa. But all of a sudden, you know, they're not on the market anymore. Why did that happen? Maybe because he told them I wasn't going-- he's not going there. And he's going somewhere else. I mean, it didn't happen by accident.","- You know, it is interesting. I always felt Gruden has a Nick Saban quality. He wears people out. But by the time you want to strangle Nick, you graduate and go to the NFL. It's why he's perfect in college. I worked in Tampa. Now, I didn't work there when Jon did, I worked there when Tony Dungy did. But when I left-- I have a lot of friends there, and they all told me, to Charlie's point, the players hated Gruden, the executives did, the front office, the coaches, he wore people out. So I always thought he was perfectly suited for college. But I think Jon sees himself as an NFL--","- I don't think he's-- I think he would have been a disaster at the college level. I just don't think he would have dealt with the recruiting, the travel--",- Boosters.,"- All of it. I don't think he would have worked. You said something about the 10 years off, because I think that's the initial reactions-- people are going to say oh my goodness, that's way too long to be out of the game. But I think the fact that he actually was involved and that--","So I got a quick story for you. So I did a whole season of college football games with ESPN, and then I got bounced for the bowl game. It was the Outback Bowl. Because it was in Tampa, and because Gruden could do it in his backyard. So my entire crew-- producer, director, they all did the game with Gruden. And I got back and I was like how was it. And they looked at me-- and they looked at me like I was the laziest guy on the planet, because they said Gruden had made-- had set up meetings with them, had burned a DVD of highlights of plays that the teams had done-- both teams, he had watched both games-- given them an hour-long breakdown which he dictated, and basically told them what schemes to look out for throughout the game.","Football is in his blood. I think he has been studying the game as a student of the game. But I would I would be curious to you because I think there are some significant differences. They're doing more college concepts, you're seeing those aspects creep into the game. Do you-- are you concerned about the tenures?","- See, like in my case, I've had people in the last three years offer me jobs. And I've almost felt like I'm almost better suited to go somewhere as, like, an assistant head coach on offense, grooming-- being there for an offensive coordinator, maybe who's not quite ready yet-- but somebody who can feed them. Because somebody who knows the game inside and out but can complement today's game-- because in three years the game's changed a lot.",- It has.,"- It's not the same just-- let's line up and I right with the fullback off set and do a play-action pass and pop it to the tight end down the middle of the field, versus 2 Tampa. I mean, it's not just that simple anymore.",- Yeah.,"- This is PT Barnum. I'm sorry. I went and saw the greatest showman. This-- what a hire for him. I mean, you get this guy going to Vegas. He is a sucker born every minute. This is who you want at the helm. This is why they're going to do it, too.","- No, I buy into that a lot.",[MUSIC PLAYING],Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | FOX Cincy | RSS | Site Map FS1 | FOX | FOX News | Fox Corporation | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes,"™ and © 2019 Fox Media LLC and Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

If we have got a game Saturday, Tuesday in a cup replay and a big game the following Saturday I might change my view on that.

Expecting an announcement about this, and this weekend’s EPL coverage, by FOX before Saturday.","if I were a betting man, I’d put some $ on the Arsenal-Everton match at 10 AM ET Sat being live on FSC.",I’d be surprised if any football will be played this weekend in Britain as it’s currently -10 here and more snow on the way.,"Why do they cancel games for snow? Or is it b/c of the cold? I’ve seen them play in nearly torrential downpours, but they won’t play if there’s snow? Can’t they clear it off the field prior to game time? Is it just a matter of the snow have far more of an effect on the play than rain does?","May be stupid questions, but just never understood this.","It’s not so much a problem with the pitch or the players, it’s more the area around the stadium. Clubs cannot risk injuries to fans so all the games that have been called off so far in the prem have been called off because of health and safety reasons rather than the pitch being frozen","I have friends who live in Hertfordshire who tell me all it takes is an inch of snow that turns to ice to put a stop to everything. They had to walk 50 minutes to catch a train from Tring to Euston station—ditto going home. If there’s any ice anywhere near the stadium, the HEALTH and SAFETY rules come into play. The gov’t doesn’t think people are capable of making decisions on their own.",The reason they don’t play because of the snow is not the pitch condition it’s the roads leading to the stadiums and the car parks. If they are unsafe for the thousands of fans then they call the game off. A lot of the pitches in the UK have underground heating so they don’t freeze.,"I read the other day that all Premier League pitches are required to have underground heating. The lower leagues are not required to have them, so you see a lot more matches called for unplayable pitch, especially in League One and lower.",I hope the Arsenal Everton game goes ahead and the blue boys upset the gooners. We are always poor against the Arse so time to turn the tide and hopefully see Landon turn up with a brace. NSNO,That is interesting. Sports here still play games in the most wretched weather you can imagine. They would never cancel a game because it is unsafe to travel. Too much depends on the tv money. The only NFL games I have ever seen postponed were for hurricanes. They have moved them to later in the day but never cancel the game for bad roads.,"Yeah it is unusual here. Games used to get cancelled a lot because the pitch was frozen but as already mentioned, most if not all the prem grounds have underground heating now so that doesn’t happen anymore. These are the first lot of games i’ve known be cancelled for health and safety reasons but then again, this is some of the worst weather we’ve had for over 20 yrs.","As far as the Donovan situation goes, I don’t think he’ll start, Moyes wont want to start someone who hasn’t played a match for a couple of months, I think he’ll probably get 20 mins as a sub or something like that. I think it would be a good game for him to make his debut in though as Arsenal are not likely to give him a kicking were as a stoke or a bolton would probably just kick the crap out of him for 90 mins and make it a difficult debut. Looking forward to seeing how he does, should be interesting.",Just curious how much snow did london receive? Specifically highbury if anyone knows.,"Didn’t realize Prem League fans were so soft…The Buffalo Bills played last week in a driving blizzard and still got 60,000 fans even though they were way out of the playoffs…just put on a few extra layers, have a few more pints and shots of whiskey and get out the barrel fires in the parking lot! I would think playing and watching in those torrential downpours I always see on TV would be much worse than playing in snow","Well the fans don’t make the choice, the clubs decide if the game is off. I’m sure the fans would go if the game was on. Maybe the clubs don’t want to get hit with a load of claims when people are falling on their backside and cracking their head.",It was -10 last night in the majority of the country and if you are unlucky enough to be scottish it was -25 up there.,Not sure how much snow London had as i live in the northwest about 15 mile from Liverpool but i heard on the radio they had about 10 inches of snow.,"When i click on the link for the TV schedule, it says the page does not exist.

"When Jeff Jackson arrived in South Bend in 2005 to become the new Notre Dame hockey coach, defenseman Noah Babin didn't exactly create the best first impression. ""I remember our first meeting when he got here,"" said Babin, now a senior, ""and I told him 'I don't like curfews or rules' and this and that, because, you know, I like to kind of be more of an interesting, freewheeling person. He kind of laughed and said, 'Well, you're going to have a lot of that.'"" Jackson shouldn't have been too surprised to have a bit of a rebel on his hands. After all, Babin's hockey career began with runs-ins with the police in his hometown of West Palm Beach, Fla., for playing too much roller hockey in the street outside his home. And he's been going against the grain and in some cases his own expectations ever since. Which is the only way a kid from sunny South Florida could end up traversing the cold plains of the Midwest in search of an ice hockey dream. ""It was pure dumb luck, really,"" said Babin. ""My parents ran a roller hockey league there, and it progressed into an ice hockey rink just down the street from my house."" So Babin traded wheels for blades and turned into a rare species of Florida rink rat. ""I kept hanging around the rink, and after a while, all the older guys said I should leave, go try and play somewhere,"" said Babin. ""So we took a shot in the dark, went up north, and it sort of landslided."" At age 14, Babin left the balmy climes and sandy shores of his boyhood home and ended up in the Detroit area's Midwest Elite Hockey League. ""I was just going to play one year and go back (to Florida),"" Babin recollected. ""At first, I went to play for a Compuware team in Michigan, and after that year, the Little Caesar's team wanted to pick me up, so I thought 'OK.' ""And after that, and I don't know why, but somebody in USA liked me."" So nearly two years after Babin thought he was pulling up anchor in Michigan and headed back to West Palm Beach, he instead was headed to Ann Arbor to join the U.S. National Team Development Program, which was the creation of Jackson in an earlier career incarnation. Babin's career took off there with the U.S. team, where he played for both the Under-17 and Under-18 national teams at the world championships. The stick he used to score the winning goal for the gold medal in the 2001 U-17 World Championships is currently in the Hockey Hall of Fame. After a stint in the USHL, Babin ended up at Notre Dame, partly because he was looking for the best possible education, and partly because he was a sucker for the movie ""Rudy."" His four years under the golden dome have followed a similar path -- redemption at the end of a long and grueling path. That path started with an NCAA Tournament appearance in his rookie year, followed by a torturous 5-27-6 travesty and the subsequent departure of coach Dave Poulin and arrival of Jackson. ""I think our class has grown a lot more than anyone else around here,"" said Babin. ""We saw all the success with coach Dave Poulin, then we saw all the failures we had with Dave Poulin. Then with Jeff Jackson it was a complete revamp or our old system."" ""Noah's actually taken a big step this year over last year,"" commented Jackson. ""Last year, I thought he had the potential to be an elite level defenseman with his skating. This year, he's picked up his intensity and he's been better defensively. He's read the rush better, he's done a lot of things extremely well. ""Last year, I think he was one of the kids who wasn't quite sure what we were trying to do here. I'm really proud of the transition he's made over the last year. I think he's made big strides."" The No. 2 Irish (16-3-1) have made just as big strides this season, and Babin has been a big part of that. Babin has contributed a goal and eight assists to spark one of the top offenses in the nation, while shutting down opponents in Notre Dame's end to fuel one of the top defenses. ""I think our class especially had really high expectations for this year,"" said Babin, ""so it's nice to see everything just falling into place."" And for maybe the first time in his life, Babin is going with the flow, and that's just how he wants it.Steve Wozniak: Swozniak@sbtinfo.com"

Emplacement and transport of nanoparticles through permeable media are the subject of this work. The hypothesis is that nanoparticles can be made to flow through permeable media and that these flows can improve oil recovery. The testing step involves making fundamental measurements on the stability of nanoparticle dispersions, many treated to alter the wetting state of phases, the effect of these dispersions have on conventional measurements of the wetting state of fluids with polished surfaces, and finally the transport of dispersions through permeable media. The testing part lies in a concurrent theoretical program that ranges in scale from first principles and molecular dynamic simulation, to modeling of surface potentials, to larger-scale modeling of flow through permeable cores.",Martin E.

Blogs,BREAKING NEWS,PROGRAM ALERT,WEATHER ALERT,CLOSINGS & CANCELLATIONS,Blogs,WeatherThreat.com Closings,"Kearney, Neb. – For a second straight season the Nebraska-Kearney football ventures to Edmond, Okla., for a tilt with the Central Oklahoma Bronchos. UNK won its season opener last Thursday at home over Missouri Southern State, 45-0. The Bronchos were on the road at Pittsburg State and fell, 21-7. Head coach Josh Lynn like the approach the Lopers have taken this week in practice.",Every couple of seasons the MIAA schedule is redone and this is the first of a two-year cycle. That means UNK is at UCO and Washburn again while Missouri Western State comes to Cope Stadium once more. Next year the Lopers will face the same opponents in the same order with the locations flipped.,"Rain, thanks to Tropical Storm Gordon, is in the Edmond forecast so it could be a sloppy track.. Both defenses were among the MIAA’s best in 2017 and return plenty of talent. Last Thursday UNK allowed MSSU just 246 yards of offense while UCO held now-No. 28 Pitt to 332 yards despite being on the field for 35 minutes.","The ‘Chos had a crazy 2017 season, going 2-4 in games decided by a touchdown or less and winning its last six games to finish 8-4. That winning streak included a victory in the Corsicana Bowl. Thanks to a 98-yard interception return for a score right before halftime, UCO downed UNK in October, 27-13. Out gained 407-383 in that game, the win makes UCO 5-2 all-time against the Lopers.","A stout front seven features 2017 All-MIAA linebackers Alex Figueroa (79 tackles) and Colton Lindsay (100 tackles) and redshirt freshman JUCO transfer Tyrell Cummings (6-0, 315 lbs.). The linemen had an impressive seven stops at Pitt State.","Maybe no MIAA offense lost more to graduation than the ‘Chos. Quarterback Chas Stallard, 2017 MIAA Offensive Player of the Year J.T. Luper and receiver Josh Crockett (Kansas City Chiefs practice squad) have all departed. Lynn says a win over UCO would be big for the Lopers.","Looking to start 2-0 for the first time in seven years, UNK ran around, through and past Missouri Southern last week to the tune of 474 yards and five scores. Both totals are among the best in school history.","Juniors David Goodwin (Lauderhill, Fla.) and Darrius Webb (Allentown, Pa.) had big Loper debuts, each rushing for over 100 yards. Webb picked up MIAA Offensive Player of the Week honors after managing 163 yards and three TD’s (three, 10 and 98 yards) on only eight carries with Goodwin tallying 113 yards and two TD’s on eight totes. His scores came from 38 and 58 yards out, respectively.","Fourth-year junior Alex McGinnis (Crete) had a productive second start at QB, throwing for 111 yards and running for 94. He had a team-high 18 carries and completed passes to seven different teammates.

Home › Hockey Headlines › Lanna Sirijintakarn’s Unconventional Birthday Has the Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey Team Giving Thanks,"By Administrator on November 18, 2017 • ( 1 )","When celebrating a birthday, most pre-school children have a party with family and friends, eat cake and ice cream and receive lots of gifts. But recently, Highland Park Falcons Mighty Mite, Lanna Sirijintakarn, celebrated her 5th birthday in another way…not by receiving, but by giving back.","Lanna still had a fun party at the ice skating rink with family, friends, pizza and cake, but partygoers were asked to forego the gifts for a donation to the Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey (CBSH) team instead.","On Saturday, November 12th Lanna attended a CBSH team practice and presented their team captain, Tim Adams, with an envelope of checks, totaling $650.",So what was the motivation behind Lanna’s unconventional birthday celebration?,"“Lanna is small for her age, and on top of that, she is already dealing with stereotypes that surround being a girl and Asian,” said Ed Sirijintakarn. “With that in mind, as well as her growing passion for hockey, we wanted to come up with a teaching point for her 5th year…that absolutely anybody can play hockey regardless of size, sex, and race, physical or mental disability.”","Lanna has a friend in her Pre-K class who has Down Syndrome. “We asked Lanna if instead of receiving gifts, if it was okay for her friends to donate money to CBSH to give kids like her friend the opportunity to play hockey,” said her father. “She was very excited with the idea and readily agreed.”","When Lanna was 3½, she was bitten by the hockey bug while watching a Chicago Blackhawks game. She told her parents that she wanted to learn “how to skate”.","“We brought Lanna to an ice rink in Skokie thinking she meant figure skating, but instead she pointed over to the kids that were playing ice hockey,” said her mother, Utchavadee Nakpresha.","After learning basic skating with her dad and taking lessons at Heartland Ice Arena, Lanna began skating with the Highland Park Falcons and her passion for the game really grew. Her excitement for the sport has inspired her dad to sign up for adult learn-to-play classes. Her mom is also learning how to ice skate and the family hopes that Lanna’s 1 year old brother will take to the ice too.","Given the Sirijintakarn family’s affection for the sport of ice hockey and Lanna’s friendship with a classmate with Down Syndrome, having the Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey team be the recipients of Lanna’s birthday gift was a perfect fit.","Lanna’s parents noted, “this was also made possible in part thanks to the educational program offered at Lanna’s school, Children’s Care and Development Center in Lincolnwood which includes special needs children in the classroom. By teaching kids to socialize and empathize with other kids with physical and mental disabilities, they learn that those children can also accomplish great things.”","“Our entire family is looking forward to continually finding ways to contribute to CBSH while also spreading the message that anybody can play ice hockey,” said Ed Sirijintakarn, who was also quick to give much credit and thanks to Lanna’s Pre-K class at Children’s Care and Development Center and her friends in the Thai community for their generosity on Lanna’s behalf.",More about Lanna,Q: What do you enjoy when you are not playing hockey?,"Lanna: I like to draw pictures of my friends and family. Dad: She also enjoys reading, playing board games, having friends over, and running around at the park.",Q: What are your hobbies?,Lanna: Violin! Dad: She has been playing violin for about 2 years and actually performed in her first solo concert right after we went to the CBSH practice to present them with the donation. She also participates in a Hip Hop Dance program.,Q: Do you play any other sports?,"Lanna: Gymnastics, tennis, and lacrosse. Dad: She also takes swimming lessons every week and likes to snowboard during the wintertime.",Q: What jersey number do you wear? Any special reason you picked that number?,"Lanna: I wear #9 and play for the Falcons (Highland Park’s Mighty Mites house program.) Mom: The #9 was randomly given to her, but coincidentally also honors, respects and represents the Thai people’s love for the 9th King of Thailand, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who recently passed away. It is a wonderful number for her to wear! Dad: Her favorite number is #88 though. I bet you know why!","Lanna’s Favorites Food: steak, fish and blueberries Candy: chocolate Toys: Peppa Pig, Paw Patrol and ‘surprise eggs’ Movie: “Tangled” TV Show: “Paw Patrol” Song: “So What” by P!nk Store: The Star Store (Toys-R-Us) Book: “Green Eggs and Ham” or “Dance of the Violin”","Categories: Hockey Headlines, Players in the News, Special Hockey","Tags: Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey, featured, Lanna Sirijintakarn",Text AHAI to 22828 to Subscribe

So here we go….My name is Jenny and I am crazy about this sport.,,"After nearly 8 years of watching from the beach, following Christoph Martins developments and achievements, I constantly received remarks….",,"“NO you cant kite, your disabled”",,“Its to dangerous”,,“I cant help you” or simply not replying!,,"I finally found a group of what I now call friends in Northern Ireland who made my dream possible and linked me to some invaluable resources, I am forever grateful.",,"I have been into sport and the outdoors all my life, I had a sporting accident when I was young and was paralysed from the neck down, after 2 years 7 months of rehabilitation I had my breathing and hands back! I continued with the standard route of wheelchair court sports and I competed to a high","level due to my love of sport but I always had one eye on the ocean and outdoors, I wanted to be fit, I wanted to be active with friends both walking and not, I didn’t want to follow the standard route and I wanted to be outside!",,"At University I studied Sports Science and Biomechanics, when I had free time I would kayak, abseil, surf, water ski with friends and after leaving university this continued. I have spent time travelling to work as a strength and conditioning coach and in every country where there was water I would be under it scuba diving or on top surfing and fell in love with the ocean all over again. Id just like to point out I learned the hard way of how to adapt these sports for me, I didn’t know anyone else and there was some interesting adaption’s to a surf board to name a few : it involved half a football and gym mats!","I first watched kite surfing in Australia, I watched how they jumped and moved with such grace – from then I was hooked or actually I wanted to be unhooked;-)Once I returned to Europe I spent a few years searching for someone to teach me, I couldn’t find anyone and for the first time in my life I felt different, I felt disabled because this sport was new and not open to everyone….","That all changed after years of research, youtube and emails….. and an instructor and now friend who told me I was crazy but he would teach me because he new the passion within me was strong.","The goal was to be a totally independent safe kite surfer, just like any one else and so it began with a blog called Madness on NIKiteforum.com which turned into an amazing adventure with a group of friends on a beach in the middle of winter when it’s snowing and any sane person would be curled up on a sofa watching TV! But no not us we spent the winters teaching me to set up lines, launch, land, loop, inflate my kites, fly from my chair, adapt a buggy and after all the land work was done ….and a few eye lashes batted to get my kites inflated (being a girl does have its perks after all!) we moved to the water.","During all this time I followed christophes developments, spoke with him and others, crossed ideas and eventually had a wakestyle seat and board…..",I then was then put in contact with the Global Kite Foundation and was intrigued to hear there was a campaign to get others like myself on the water and so the trip to the first CataKite Clinic and Seated Solo Riding arrived…..

"Commencing its 70th season this past weekend, the 2017 Italian Baseball League (IBL) is the talk of the town in Bologna, Rimini, San Marino, Nettuno, Parma, Padova, Novara and Padule Sesto Fiorentino. Eight Italian teams from those regions are divided into two groups of four and will play games every weekend. The top squads from each division will square off in a best-of-five-game series semi-final and final competitions between August 18 and September 9, 2017. Defending champions UnipolSai Bologna, who claimed their 10th IBL title in 2016, will likely show their winning form again in 2017, while new IBL contender, Padule Sesto Fiorentino, is viewed as an outside long shot. Let’s get a closer look at each team’s roster to understand why everyone is so excited about professional baseball in Italy.","UnipolSai Fortituto Bologna manager Lele Frignani has put together a well-balanced roster of seasoned veterans and up-and-coming stars. The always dependable Roberto Corradini mentors a strong Bologna pitching staff which includes former Boston Red Sox prospect Nicolo Clemente, former Team Italy WBC pitchers Filippo Crepaldi, Luca Panerati and Nick Pugliese, Venezuelan newcomer Raul Garcia Junior, and the American-born duo of Justin Cicatello and Rudy Owens. Azzurri catcher Marco Sabbatani shares the catching duties with veteran Venezuelan backstop, Osman Marval. Bologna boasts a quality infield featuring a pair of Azzurri favorites in first baseman Alex Sambucci and second baseman Alessandro Vaglio as well as two outstanding imports: Venezuelan shortstop Jose Flores, and Dominican third baseman Robel Garcia. Center fielder Paolino Ambrosino, who was the first Italian-born player to participate in the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League while playing for the 2016-17 Tigres de Chinandega, joins fellow Italians Alessandro Grimaudo and Alex Russo as well as the San Francisco-born Nick Nosti to round out the Bologna outfield.","2016 IBL runner-up Rimini seeks revenge against Bologna this season under the leadership of manager Paolo Ceccaroli. Former LA Dodger prospect Federico Celli teams up with Italian American Nico Garbella, Cuban All-Star Maikel Caseres and Venezuelan Carlos Duran to make up what some believe to be the best outfield in the IBL. Azzurri pitchers Jose Escalona, Carlos Richetti, and Carlos Teran give Rimini depth on the hill. Dominican hurler Jose Rosario and former Marlins Venezuelan prospect Ricardo Hernandez add even more appeal to the Pirates pitching staff. Shortstop Juan Carlos Infante, a name many may recall seeing on the 2013 Team Italy WBC roster, leads a talented crew of infielders including first baseman Daniele Malengo, second basemen Lino Zappone and Freddy Noguera in addition to third baseman Lorenzo Di Fabio. Catchers Gionni Luciani and Antonio Giovannini complement the Rimini roster.",,"T&A San Marino GM Mauro Mazzotti has faith that team manager Marco Nanni can bring an IBL championship title to the “most serene republic” sooner than later with a slew of tried and tested athletes hungry for success. Loyal Azzurri players include DH Mario Chiarini, outfielders Sebastiano Poma, Lorenzo Avagnini, and Mattia Reginato as well as pitchers Nick Morreale, Frailyn Florian and Junior Oberto. Former Houston Astros prospect Carlos Quevedo, Andres Perez and Yoimer Camacho are a trio of dangerous Venezuelan pitchers that will try to keep opponents off balance and off the bases. Tomasso Cherubini and Ludovico Coveri complete the San Marino pitching staff. Shortstop Erick Epifano, who played four seasons in the Dominican and Venezuelan Summer Leagues as a former MLB prospect, heads up the San Marino infield with the assistance of first basemen Gabriele Ermini and Francesco Imperiali, second basemen Riccardo Babini and Luca Pulzetti in addition to third basemen Leonardo Ferrini. Simone Albanese, Daniele Cenni and Pierangelo Cit divvy up the catching for T&A San Marino.","Angel Service Nettuno Baseball City manager Alberto D’Auria will try to get his team of spirited players into the IBL playoffs for the second consecutive season. Former LA Dodgers prospect Federico Giordani joins fellow Italian teammates Ennio Retrosi and Stefano Giannetti as well as Venezuelan Ronald Bermudez and Italian American Nick Davenport in the Nettuno outfield. Shortstop and former Atlanta Braves prospect Mattia Mercuri complements the Nettuno infield along with Dominican-born Omar Luna, Argentine-born Sebastian Fontana and Renato Imperiali at first base, Andrea Sellaroli at second base, and Giuseppe Mazzanti and Leonardo Colagrossi at third base. 25-year-old American import pitcher Ethan Carnes, who pitched three years in the NY Yankees minor league system, makes Angel Service Nettuno an intriguing IBL entry. Other pitchers on the squad include Milvio Andreozzi, Matteo Modica, Yuri Morellini, Valerio Simone, Paolo Taschini, and Venzuelan Ronald Uviedo. Catchers Mario Trinci, Angelo Taurelli and Vinicio Sparagna add strength to the Nettuno roster.",,"Parma Clima advisor Sal Varriale takes pride in his important role and his invaluable contribution to Italian baseball for the past four decades. Honored by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) with the 2012 ABCA Meritorious Service Award, Varriale was recently acknowledged in Parma when he was awarded The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana) and the title of Knight of the Republic (Cavaliere della Repubblica). Entrusting former Team Italy coach and current Parma manager Gilberto Gerali to assemble a competitive squad capable of winning the 2017 IBL Championship title, Varriale is confident the team chemistry in Parma will yield remarkable results on the diamond. Starting with Azzurri faithful Stefano Desimoni in the outfield and Yomel Rivera on the mound, Parma Clima can do no wrong. Recruiting four Venezuelan standouts: former MLB pitcher Eduardo Sanchez (St. Louis Cardinals/Chicago Cubs), shortstop and former LA Dodgers prospect Leon Mirabal, third baseman and former Colorado Rockies/Boston Red Sox prospect Mario Martinez as well as closer Gumercindo Gonzalez plus one Columbian All-Star in third baseman Adolfo Gomez, is no easy task. Combine this international arsenal with the prowess of local players like pitcher Michele Pompani, second baseman Manuel Piazza, third baseman Luca Scalera and outfielder Leonardo Zileri, Parma is destined to be the team to beat in the 2017 IBL playoffs.","Your browser does not support iframes. In the IBL for its third year, Tommasin Padova manager Francesco Aluffi’s team is getting better with age. Perhaps the biggest acquisition since Lenny Randle joined the IBL, Padova recruited former MLB veteran Mark Teahen to come out of retirement to play during the 2017 IBL Season. While vacationing in Italy and working out in Bologna three years ago, the left-handed-hitting utility player expressed interest in playing baseball in the IBL. During his seven-year MLB career, Teahen had 759 hits, including 67 homers, while playing for the Kansas City Royals, the Chicago White Sox and the Toronto Blue Jays. Other Padova imports include Venezuelans Roberto Canache, who pitched in the St. Louis Cardinals organization, and infielder Carlos Perdomo as well as Dominican left-handed pitcher Yunior Novoa, who has quality spent time in the minor and independent leagues before landing in Italy. The synergy between Azzurri pitcher Enrico Crepaldi and catcher Elia Marinig provides Padova with an edge over opposing hitters, while Andrea Berini offers extra protection in the outfield with his speed and agility.","Renny Duarte, who European baseball fans will recall served as the long-time pitching coach for Spain, takes over the managerial duties for Novara. Joining Duarte in the IBL is Team Spain shortstop Oscar Angulo, whose offensive excellence was key to the team’s silver medal finish in the 2016 European Baseball Championship. Led by Azzurri veterans Jairo Ramos and Yovani D’Amico, Novara has an international pitching syndicate featuring Jonathan Aristil from the Dominican Republic and Raul Ruiz from Venezuela in addition to Brent Buffa and Jeremy Castro from the USA. Other players of interest include local pitching favorites Nicolas Loardi and Pietro Paolo Cadoni plus Venezuelan catcher Luis Alvarez and Italian Dominican infielder Nathanael De Jesus. Novara should not be taken lightly as the new skipper Duarte plays to win and his players will follow his lead.","Polisportiva Padule Sesto Fiorentino manager Paolo Minozzi knows he has a big job ahead as the leader for the newest addition to the IBL. Former Cincinnati Reds pitching prospect Jesus Parra and former Chicago Cubs pitching prospect Carlos Rodriguez, a pair of strong arms from Venezuela, make their IBL debut for Padule Sesto Fiorentino. Minozzi recruited some of the best Italian pitchers available including: Alessandro Ularetti, Marco Costantini, Massimiliano “The Rocket” Geri, Filippo Gandolfi and Matthias Zotti. The catching quartet of Fabio Origlia, Davide Tomaello and Valdemaro Faticanti and Marco Valsecchi will get their fair share of time behind the plate. With first base being anchored by Emiliano Lumini and Samy Ramirez, infielders Marco Labardi, Samuele Reggioli, Manuel Ricci and Livinston Santaniello split the second baseman and shortstop duties. Cubans Yordany Alarcon and Yordany Scull stake their claim to third base and center field respectively, while Nazzareno Neri and Rojelio Maldonado round out the Padule outfield. There is no doubt the new kids on the block will experience growing pains throughout season; however, Padule Sesto Fiorentino is a welcome addition to the IBL.",,,Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Follow,Error: Twitter did not respond.

Please read the rules before joining the discussion.,"MELBOURNE — For tennis fans who hoped the Australian Open fourth round would produce a 31st career meeting between sisters Serena and Venus Williams, there isn’t good news to report.","At least for now, fans will have to wait for the next installment of the sibling rivalry. That’s because world No. 1 Simona Halep played the role of spoiler.","Halep, donning a serious looking left thigh wrap, came out firing on all cylinders from the outset of a third-round encounter against the 38-year-old Venus, which the Romanian won 6-2, 6-3.","The 27-year-old Halep, who won her first Grand Slam title at the French Open last year, was the steadier player on the court. Venus went for it all and that recklessness was costly to the tune of 33 unforced errors. In contrast, Halep had just 12.","“I think she played pretty flawless today,” Venus said. “Only 12 errors. Unfortunately, I had almost three times as many. Just needed to keep my errors down. But she played a great match.”","Serena Williams celebrates after defeating Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska during their third round match at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 19. (Photo: Andy Brownbill, AP)","Halep offered Venus five break points in the opening set, but never surrendered her serve. In the second set, the first two games featured service breaks, but from there Halep held serve for the remainder of the 77-minute match.","Although a moot point now, it’s worth noting that 36-year-old Serena’s won four of the last five battles against Venus, including when the two played here in the 2017 final. Serena won that match, with the public in the dark that she was already pregnant with her first child, Alexis Olympia.",More: Serena Williams routs Dayana Yastremska in third round at Australian Open,More: US Open champion Naomi Osaka survives scare at Australian Open,"The lone victory Venus has orchestrated against Serena since 2015 was at last year’s Indian Wells tournament, Serena’s first official event back from maternity leave.","“I would just say in general losing is not fun, no matter who you're trying to play next,” said Venus, when asked if she’s disappointed not to be playing Serena again. “So it has nothing to do with the next round or who you're playing.”","Now it will be interesting to see how Serena, a former No. 1, fares when trying her luck against the current No. 1. She’s played Halep nine times, the last match at the 2016 US Open, and Serena holds an 8-1 advantage. But all of those outings were before Halep was ever No. 1 or a Grand Slam champion.","“I honestly would love to face the world No. 1,” said the 16th-seeded Serena Williams, after she captured her third-round match 6-2, 6-1 over Ukrainian teen Dayana Yastremska on Saturday. “At the same time I would love for Venus to win. I think either way, regardless, I’ll be ready for either opponent.","“I haven’t played the world No. 1 since I’ve been back (from having Olympia), I don’t think,” she added. “It will be good.”",Halep understands the difference between Serena’s position in the game and her own.,"“In my opinion, to be No. 1 in the world and to be the best player in the world, it's a little bit different,” she said. “In this moment, I'm No. 1 in the world, so I will take that. I feel like I have been there many months, many weeks.","“But for sure she's the best player in the world because she won so many Grand Slams. She's been a lot on No. 1. I cannot compare my results to her. But in this moment, I am confident that I am in this position, and I'm positive about it.”","Halep didn’t want to think about the fact she is in position to beat the Williams sisters in back-to-back matches. But she knows that despite her record against Serena, she will go to the court with a different attitude.","“It's going to be just a huge match for me,” Halep said. “I will not put pressure on myself. There's a good chance for me to play my best tennis and to feel good on court.","“She was (intimidating) when I was younger, but now I don't feel intimidated any more. I have huge respect for her because she's a great champion, but she's just an opponent next round.”","As for when fans will see Venus play next, she said she isn’t currently entered in any tournaments before Indian Wells.","She did, however, appear to place her name in contention for the upcoming Fed Cup first round against Australia, being played in Asheville, North Carolina, next month, although she said she hasn’t spoken with captain Kathy Rinaldi about being part of the team.","“I think that would be fun,” she said, of Fed Cup. “I mean, I'd have to be asked on the team, so...Hopefully they would have me.”",A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.,

"As I write this, countless explainer posts are going up online, offering answers to one timely question: Who is Carli Lloyd?",Here are a couple things you may already know:,1) She is the star player of the U.S. World Cup soccer team — she won the Golden Ball as best player of the tournament after her team’s win last night.,"2) She scored a hat trick in the FIFA Women’s World Cup final against Japan — and remains only the second person, and first woman, to do so.",3) She scored a goal in every U.S. game in the knockout stage of the Women’s World Cup.,"4) In addition to her Golden Ball, Silver Boot and World Cup gold medal, she also has two Olympic gold medals.","5) As far as I can tell (and believe me, I checked) she isn’t Jewish.","Something you may not know? The 32-year-old soccer sensation owes much of her incredible success to one special person: Rudi Klobach, her high school coach — and a Holocaust survivor.","Klobach was born in 1944 in Theresienstadt, his wife Barbara told The New York Times. His father, Karl, was made to bury bodies of fellow Jewish prisoners. After the war, the family moved to Dusseldorf, and then to the U.S. when Rudi was 4.","Over his 20 years as a New Jersey girls’ soccer coach, Klobach was responsible for 256 wins. In 2011, he was named to the South Jersey Soccer Hall of Fame.","But, as the Times story makes clear, no one meant as much to him as midfielder Carli Lloyd from Delran High School, whom he coached from 1997 to 2000. Klobach watched her rise to high school star status, and go on to win two Olympic gold medals. After every win, the Times reports, he would exclaim: “That’s my girl!”","Sadly, he wasn’t there to see her ascend to sports legend during last night’s game. Klobach died in January after a three-year battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease.","“He was never surprised at her success because she had always been so driven,” Barbara Klobach said. “He liked coaching her because she was so serious about the game.Some girls were just there for social hour, but no, not Carli.”",RIP Rudi Klobach.

I just love it. I grew up with the sport and watched my sister play. I am really excited I can finish my basketball career for Assumption,” says Belle.","In the summer of 2014, Belle was playing for a traveling team in the off-season, when she was injured on a play.",“I was driving across the lane and into layup. I got fouled and I landed on my left leg. It buckled and it hurt. I knew something was wrong.”,"Dr. Andrew Bries, ORA Orthopedics","ORA Orthopedics sports medicine physician, Dr. Andrew Bries, ordered an MRI that revealed a torn ACL. The ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) is one of the four primary ligaments in the knee. These ligaments control the knee’s back and forth motion.","“The treatment for a torn ACL is reconstruction,” says Dr. Bries.","“When Dr. Bries broke the news to me, I knew he felt for me, but I was surprised it was my ACL,” Belle recalls. Her injury was severe enough to sideline her from both basketball and volleyball her junior year. “I knew I was going to miss my favorite sports, but my goal was to play one more year.”","Dr. Bries performed the ACL surgery at Crow Valley Surgery Center, a surgical center specializing in orthopedics. The surgery is performed on an outpatient basis and usually takes about 60-90 minutes to complete.","“To rebuild Belle’s ACL, I harvested a small part of her own hamstring tissue and built a new ligament,” he says. “This surgery is minimally invasive and spares surrounding tissue, leading to a quicker recovery and return-to-play.”",“Patients like Belle are home the same day and walking soon after. Strong physical therapy and exercising usually means athletes can return to their previous activity between 7-12 months. We also make an effort to time the surgery with athletic seasons so that players can be cleared prior to the opening season.”,"Every year, ORA performs over 200 ACL reconstructions.","“I was surprised that the surgery was so easy,” adds Belle. “It went very quickly. It was just one day and I was home. I was really nervous and I had never had surgery before. Everyone at ORA was comforting. I went home the same day. They had me up and walking, and I was in physical therapy the next day. I was able to play in a game seven months later at the end of the 2015 season.”",Women more prone to ACL injury than men,"Following surgery and months of rehabilitative exercise and training, Belle is back playing the game she loves, but she is not alone in her comeback to health. According to NIH Medline Plus, young women are two to eight times more likely than young males to injure their ACLs.","In general, young female athletes are more prone to ACL injuries than their male counterparts due to body structure, hormones, and muscular development.","“Due to a young woman’s wider pelvis, her knees often point inward to a greater degree. And because women also have less muscular strength than men, the result is greater stress being placed on their ACL. When women land, the knee goes inward, and that’s why they are higher risk,” Dr. Bries explains.","Says Belle, “As a senior, I feel really great. I don’t even notice it anymore. I was hoping to play in college, but I want to go to Iowa State and major in marketing or management.”","Although Belle won’t be playing for the Cyclones, her love of basketball is always with her. “I’ll be playing in Intramurals and really looking forward to my future.” You go, Belle!",Additional Services,Support,Home

This team can seriously only run the ball and with a lot of time to prepare for it I think Penn St can shut it down. Penn St has the better athletes and coach. I actually think they will be motivated here for this game. I will gladly lay this number,I dont think Iowa has a chance in this game. When you look back at Iowa you realize they beat zero good teams. This is a total mis match IMO and Miss St will be able to shut down the very one dimensional Iowa team. Also Iowa is without their best offensive player who happens to play TE. I think Miss St puts a number on them,I like the Aggies here for the sure fact that they have a ton more talent here. The Aggies finished the season by beating LSU and I think under first year head coach Jimbo Fisher they will be excited here. NC ST had a pretty easy schedule and I dont think Finley their QB is anything special at all. This could get ugly,This is just too many points for a NW team who will be fired up for this game. They had a great year making to the Big Ten Championship. Utah is getting their QB back here for this game but these teams are so very similar that I dont see a blowout happening.,"All I have heard is how good MSU is in the dog role. I just think that this Oregon will be ultra motivated here with their stud QB Herbert coming back next season. Michigan St has some major issues on offense as they had scored 24,6,6,14 to finish the season. Oregon is a lot better than people actually think and with this low spread they take care of business.","This is just a ton of points of here. I know Bama is the real deal but I also know how they looked without a healthy Tua. Clearly Bama has more talent and is better coached no denying that, but for them to cover two touchdowns. I just think Oklahoma can get a few stops and Oklahoma with Murray will give them all they want on defense. Murray is just a special player you dont see come around often and I trust him to keep this close","I like Florida here today playing in their home state. This is just a pure motivation game. Michigan had their dreams crushed when they were blown out vs Ohio St. They had hopes of playing for a National Title, but that isn't the case now. They are missing several key starters here who are sitting out. Florida does have a defense and with some guys out on Michigan's defense I think Florida can do just enough to get bye","This game just simply means more to Iowa St who some would say this is their best bowl game ever. This program has taken a turn for the better under Campbell. Washington St on the other hand had their dreams crushed as they were alive for the Playoffs and lost to their rival Washington and now are playing here. Good bowl yes, but not what they had hoped for. Also Iowas St has faced teams like them all year long in the Big 12 with the pass happy offenses.",I really like Cuse here and all the motivation clearly lies with them. They are looking to finish their on a very high note while WVU has simply no motivation as their leader and starting QB Will Grier has decided to skip the game and go pro. WVU will fold here.,"So I think the wrong team is favored here in this game. The Badgers had a down year there is no taking that away from them, but does Miami have the motivation edge for a a bowl game played in New York? I sure dont think so at all. The fact that Hornibrook is out I actually think is better as he really hurt them based on his health. The Badgers will win this game on the ground and I wouldn't be surprised if it got ugly.","Not much crazy in depth here, but I just trust Duke here coming from the ACC. The talent gap is on their side here as well. They have the better coach and will also have a lot bigger fan base traveling to Louisiana for this game.","To me all the motivation here sides with UAB. Remember this was a school a few years ago that took their program away. They really want this game IMO as this would be a school record 11 wins. Also I think Northern Illinois already had their Super Bowl by coming back and beating Buffalo to win the MAC. I also just think that UAB has the better athletes, played a lot tougher schedule and will have no problem scoring",The rare combo of a father-son coach QB duo. Well we have that here with Mid Tenn St and while they may not win the game you for sure know the effort will be there given that fact alone. Mid Tenn also played a lot tougher schedule which helps them a ton in this spot. Also App St lost their coach which sets up for a tough situation,"We have a Mountain West school vs Pac 12 in a good match up. I just think Fresno is much better despite being from the so called lesser conference since they are non power 5. I know people are going to make the case that ASU had a lot of close losses, but the PAC 12 was down big time this year and they had a miracle come back to beat their rival Arizona. Fresno St is no joke with their two losses being on the road @ Minnesota which they should have won and @ Boise, but they got that revenge in the MWC Title game. ASU will miss their stud WR here as well",This play here is pretty simple for reasoning. Utah St had a good year but ended up coming short in making the Mountain West Conference Championship game which they had their sites on. Now with what has taken place with all the coaching changes I just dont see it working out in a positive way.,I think its safe to say Ohio St played a lot of this season pretty much not interested simply because of their schedule. Well last week the sleeping giant woke up and I had them in an easy winner over their rival Michigan. The talent gap here is huge and the fact this this is played indoor on turf only benefits Ohio St. Also they really need to impress the committee and I think they just put it in Northwestern,I'm going with Memphis here in this game. We all are aware of what took place with UCF stud QB Milton. That is just a devastating loss for a team like UCF who was looking to make it back to back years without losing a game. Memphis let the first game slip by this year losing by 1 despite being up by 13 at half. I think they get their revenge here,"I will take Oklahoma in the ultimate revenge game here. Yes, I know their defense isn't great everyone knows that, but I think they can create a couple key turnovers and get a lead which will be hard for Texas to comeback on. Texas QB isn't 100% healthy either. The most important thing here though is that Oklahoma wants to make a statement to be in the playoffs and I think they do exactly that.","I really like this game tonight for Washington. The Huskies have been a terrible team ATS this season going just 3-9. The thing here though is that these teams already met and Utah was in a good spot and failed to show up at home vs Washington. They lost that game 21-7. So yes, the line has been adjusted some here but now Utah is without their QB and RB for this game. I want no part of Utah and Washington rolls",Utah St is a good story this season losing the first game of the season and now winning 10 straight. The last few weeks their competition has been suspect at best. While they should have lost last week on the hail mary if it wasn't for the guy stepping out of bounds. I think Boise is a very tough place to go on the road and win. They havent been talked about much this season but I think they get the job done,This game means more to one team here and that is the Aggies. I say that because under first year head coach Jimbo Fisher he wants to have a big signature win and he knows what this game does for a fan base. LSU I dont trust in this tough environment facing a good Aggies defense.,This is pure a motivation spot here. After losing 4 straight heading into last week Miami didnt give up on their season blowing out Va Tech on the road. I think that is a huge play on sign here against a Pitt team with zero motivation. They have already locked up their spot in ACC title game vs Clemson next regardless of what happens here. That is a huge angle here and Miami has played its best ball at home with a 4-1 record,I had UCLA last week in a winner over their rival in USC. That game was clearly circled which now they are getting respect from odds makers but this is a let down spot as well. The key here is that Stanford really had a bye week because of the wildfires their game with Cal was cancelled. They got healthier with that and should be able to really wear down this poor UCLA defense,"I just think there is too much value to pass up on here now with Ohio St. Yes, the Buckeyes have looked like crap we all know that. I just think Meyer will have his guys ready here and with it cross some key numbers I had to take them. Harbaugh is trying to do something he hasnt done yet which is win a huge game especially a big road game. Maybe Michigan does win but I doubt its a blowout","This Washington St team has been disrespected by odds makers all year long. I know most aren't giving them a shot in the playoffs but I think these players feel that way and throw in the fact this is a big time rivalry game where Washington has beat them, the Cougars will pour it on this underachieving Husky team this year.","I think the wrong team is favored here. West Virginia had a heart breaking loss last week @ Oklahoma St, but this team is so much better at home. I cant back a team in the Sooners that has been torched all year long. Their defense is awful. Also worth mentioning that WVU can still make the Big 12 title game. Give me WVU",I will take Nebraska here as believe it or not they do have a small chance to make a bowl game with a win to get to 5 wins. I think we are seeing teams heading in different directions and this is an overreaction to Iowa blowing out Illinois last week. Frost knows the importance here of this rivalry going forward and ending the season on a positive note. If Nebraska didnt win that game last week I wouldn't have liked them but the momentum they have I like this number,"Purdue has went through some things this week with their coach leaving for his alma mater, but I still think he gets them to play hard here. Wisconsin has big time QB issues here and after last weeks performance I think they have shown their season is over. With this being Brohm's last home game and also the seniors I think the effort will be there.",I was on Tennessee last week in an easy winner as they beat Kentucky straight up. I think they do the same here on their final home game to become bowl eligible which is a big thing for this team and also their coach. Missouri is getting a lot of respect because of their high powered offense but with what the Vols have shown here recently on defense I thin they can control them,I think Kansas St puts forth a pretty big effort here which could be Snyder's last home game. Texas Tech has to be deflated here coming off 3 straight losses but they are more importantly coming off back to back rival games against Oklahoma and Texas both at home where they put forth big effort. I doubt they have much interest here. Throw in the fact they are starting a backup QB as well.,It really seems like USC has mailed it in for the season now. I think the players know Coach Helton is on his way out after the season and possibly before. UCLA this is a crucial game fore first year coach Chip Kelly for recruiting purposes and also just so save some face for a down year. UCLA rises up and knocks off their rival,I really love the Gophers here in this spot. They have everything to play for here trying to become bowl eligible and that was evident last week as they drummed Purdue. Northwestern is in a terrible spot here with nothing to play for as they have locked up the Big Ten West race. Coach Fleck will have his guys ready and they win this game SU,The wrong team is favored here as Nebraska has played a lot better than their record shows. I also love the fact that this team despite having a bad record has really turned it on and not given up on the season. They have covered 5 straight games and I expect them to beat a Sparty team that is struggling at QB right now which is leading to their offensive struggles,I think we continue to see the meltdown here from Kentucky off that Georgia loss 2 weeks ago. I faded Kentucky last week and they were terrible in defeat to Tennessee. Mid Tenn will want this game and they are playing their best football right now. I still think Kentucky is deflated and quite frankly there is nothing for them to play for. Throw that in with their offense that struggles big time. This is too many points,This is an ugly one I know but I will take Arkansas here at home in the night game. This is jsut a terrible spot for LSU as their dreams were crushed last week getting shut out against Bama and knocked them out of the playoff picture. I highly doubt they care at all about playing a 2 win Arkansas team. While the Razorbacks wont be going to a bowl I see them laying everything on the line here to salvage the season.,"Cincy is one of the most improved teams in the country and I will back them here. Now, I realize they do have a huge game on deck against UCF, but I dont think they over look USF here who brings in such a bad defense. USF has only covered the number once in their last 7. They have seemed to throw in the towel after dropping that game at Houston following a 41-17 loss to Tulane at home which is a bad sign. Cincy in the night game with a very good defense wins this one easy",I believe we are seeing two teams here heading in the opposite direction. It's seems pretty clear that Miami has thrown in the towel after beating their rival Florida St. They have lost 3 straight since that game and the most they have scored in the last 3 weeks is 14 points. This team seems pretty disinterested.,Ga Tech on the other hand is playing their best football of the season winning 4 of their last 5 games and scoring over 35 points in 4 of them as well. I also believe Tech has had this one circled after letting one slip away last year @ Miami losing by 1.,This is strictly a spot play here and I look for Tennessee to be up while Kentucky to be down. Kentucky had their dreams crushed last week at home against Georgia as they would have had a chance to play for the SEC title now they really have nothing to play for here at all. Tennessee on other hand I feel this team is looking to finish their season strong and make a bowl and would love nothing more to play spoiler here to Kentucky. This is one of those games based on the spot you kinda throw the stats and everything out the window.,I have backed this Iowa St team several times now since they lost their 2nd string and now Purdy who was their 3rd string has now taken over and really changed the whole season. I just think now the price is getting a little out of hand. Iowa St went from small dogs to small favorites and since they covered a big number last week they are getting a lot of love. Baylor is coming off a nice win last week vs Oklahoma St as a home dog. The weather I think will impact this game as well as it will be played more on the ground. I also think Iowa St will be looking ahead to the match with Texas next week as it could put them in the Big 12 title game,"This game is a very odd line after looking at it. So last week Old Dominion was a 4.5 point dog to at home to Mid Tenn St who is leading the other side of the conference and now they are over 2 touchdown dog? Old Dominion out gained them last week putting up over 500 yards of offense, but they had 5 turnovers that really did them in. North Texas is actually eliminated from playing for the conference title as UAB pretty much has it wrapped up. ODU still is fighting for a bowl game and I think the effort will be there and this is an overreaction to last weeks game","I really don't think this game will be close at all. Texas AM returns home where they are 4-1 ATS and will be hungry here coming off back to back losses. Last week the Aggies lost to Aubrun by 4 as 3.5 point dogs, but they actually dominated the stats having over 400 total yards compared to 270. Ole Miss is just flat out terrible on the road giving up 500 yards a game. I think the Aggies can take some frustration out here and blow them out",I simply trust Chris Peterson here to get the Huskies back on track after last week. Believe it or not Washington still controls their own destiny in the PAC 12 North as they still play Washington St at the end of the year. Stanford really gave that game away up 14 which I think this is a tough spot to bounce back from. Stanford's numbers they really struggle on the road. I know they won @ ASU recently but that game was extremely misleading as ASU out played them. The Huskies D will shut this offense or lack thereof down,This line really does surprise me here as I thought it would come done. La Tech is easily one of the better teams outside the Power 5. I was on this team earlier in the year when they played at LSU as a 18.5 point dog and lost by 17 but it was actually closer than that. Now they are getting 24 to a lesser opponent. Miss St is coming off a big win over ranked Texas AM but the other key here is that they have Bama on deck next week. Will take the points all day in this spot,"I was on Florida last week in a loser against Georgia, and that final score didnt really indicate how close it was. It was clearly the turnovers and where they happened that turned the game. If you watched this you know what I am talking about.",I just think here we are going to see Missouri throw in the towel especially after last week. Missouri let one slip away against highly ranked Kentucky in the 4th where they lead all game. That is such a tough one here with going on the road next. Drew Lock has also struggled big time against better competition and this will be the best defense he has faced. Florida will create turnovers and Missouri wont be able to play catch up,I really like this Michigan and you know somehow they aren't really being talked about much considering how good they are. This defense wont have an issue here at all shutting down Penn St who relies so much McSorley. I think people are forgetting Michigan's only loss was to Notre Dame in week 1 who isn't a bad loss by any means. Michigan is coming off their bye week as well and will want revenge from an ugly loss last year. Also dont think that isn't in the back of Harbaugh's mind as he will run this score up no doubt about it,I like Purdue here for several reason. 2 weeks ago they had one of their biggest wins in program history in beating Ohio St so it's no surprise that they lost to Michigan St. I just think the spot here will be very hard for Iowa to bounce back from after they had a late turnover 1st and goal which could have grabbed them a win @ Penn St. Those losses are tough for anyone. Purdue also plays a style that Iowa generally struggles with. Purdue bounces back here,This spot is just sooooo good I cant pass it up. Georgia Southern is coming off a huge win in destroying App St as 11 point dogs winning that game by 20. Now they travel to LA Monroe who is off their bye week which you need to prepare for the option and they are playing a lot betting winning straight. Also Ga Southern has a huge game on deck with Troy.,I will say little upset I didn't get the best of the number on Maryland but I do think this line drops and wouldn't be surprised to see the Terps go off favored here. Michigan St was in a great spot last week as they were catching Purdue coming off their biggest win in years. I know Sparty can stop the run but I'm more worries about their offense and their backup QB who was very shaky last week and now on the road I simply wont trust. This Maryland team has athletes and are bowl hungry. They also just fired their coach which I think actually helps this team as he hasn't been around this season,No choice here IMO but to take Stanford. I was on Washington St last week and I believe it's fair to say that that could be their biggest win ever given the circumstances since game day was there. Washington St has covered every game and we all know the betting public loves that especially now given what we saw last week vs Oregon. Stanford has had extra time to prepare here as well which is huge. I also like the revenge angle with Stanford will swallow the Field Goal,"Maybe I am way off on this game but the wrong team is favored here. Texas AM has two losses on the season oh and they are too Clemson and Bama are those two teams any good? Miss St has struggled big time especially Fitzgerald at QB. Miss St has scored over 10 points just once in the last 4 games. The Aggies defense will have no problem here eating them up. This one seems so easy it is scary, but no opting but to take the Aggies who are all around better in every category",I like Missouri in this spot against Kentucky. Missouri had a rough patch but they played Georgia and Bama during that stretch. I just think they can outscore Kentucky here and the Wildcats just dont have the QB to play catch up. Their offense really struggles even though they have a good running game. Lock is trying to showcase is stuff for the next level and I believe Missouri wins in a route,"So Georgia is still being given a lot of respect because of their ranking. Maybe they just haven't shown it yet, but from what we have seen there is no way I wanna lay it. Georgia has played one hard team so far and they were beaten badly against a LSU team who struggles at the QB position. Well I think Florida has just as good of defense oh and they beat that LSU team SU. Both teams coming off the bye this game clearly means everything in the SEC East plus the revenge angle is well in play here with Florida. I think we see a very close game and wouldn't be surprised to see Florida win out right",This game here is one where we have an undefeated team on the road catching a full TD. I just think USF has been very lucky. Look last week they beat an awful UConn team by just 8 as 33.5 point favorites. Let's look at a couple games these teams have in common. Houston won @ East Carolina 42-20 and USF beat them at home by just 7. Houston also demolished Tulsa while USF beat them by 1. Houston is by far the better team and the line is telling the story.,This line is really of to me. Iowa St might be just 3-3 but they are playing like a top 25 team if you have watched their last 2 games. They found their qb in stud freshman Purdy who last time out just tore about a top 10 team in West Virginia. Thought this line would be closer to 7. Iowa St is coming off a bye as well. People will argue that Texh will want revenge well should have wanted it last year as well after giving up over 60 two years but failed to do so. Iowa St wins easily,"There is some Purdue money here coming in which doesn't surprise me a whole lot. But, we have another team coming off one of if not their biggest win ever in thumping Ohio St on national TV last week. I think Sparty responds with a strong effort here after laying an egg last week to their rival in Michigan. This is a great bounce back spot for them and a huge let down spot for Purdue.","This is a late add, but I do like the gophers here tonight. I was against them last week in a winner as Nebraska destroyed them. The thing is though even if it was Nebraska's first win they have played a lot better than their record indicates. I look for the Gophers to bounce back here as I believe Coach Fleck knows the importance of the situation here tonight. I also dont trust Indiana as a favorite and especially on the road given the fact they are coming off a very hard fought game in Penn St",This is a big game in the Sun Belt here as both of these teams are undefeated in conference play. I look for Ga Southern to be able to keep it within the 10 here. I think since App St is the house hold name for the average bettor that they tend to get inflated lines. The numbers on both of these teams pretty similar and with that I will side with the home dog on a week day and we all know how profitable they have been over the years.,I had USC last week as they were laying 7 against a ranked team in Colorado and won that game. I just dont trust them on the road here in a tough environment. Utah has had an extra day here but more importantly they haven't forgot about that 1 point loss last year @ USC in a game they lead 21-7 at half. We have already seen USC struggle on the road against teams like Stanford and Texas and they also barely beat a bad Arizona team.,"I think one could make the case this is the biggest game in Washington St history for the fact this is the first time that College Gameday is here. The Cougars have really surprised everyone and since they have covered every game that does worry me, but I think the spot is worse for Oregon coming off a huge win over Washington, but were very lucky to do so. Oregon has quite faced an offense like this one yet and throw in the fact that Washington St is coming off a bye I really like them here","I know it's always a bold task to go against Bama especially this year, but there are several things here why I like Tennessee. First, Tua is clearly hurt and isn't 100% which is a big factor. Also they have their bye week next before hosting playing @ LSU which I think they are looking ahead to especially given how good LSU has been so far. I really like what I saw from Tennessee last week coming off their bye week @ Auburn and winning SU as a double touchdown favorite.",This is the game where the Cornhuskers get their first win. I'm not quite sure how they let last week slip away from them but they did. I also think they haven't forgotten the beat down that Minnesota gave them last year. The Gophers also have some big injuries including cluster ones now at the RB position. Nebraska is hungry and motivated to get their first win which I think they get and can cover this small number,"So we have an undefeated Cincy team at 6-0 who is now ranked on the road facing a 4-3 Temple team and they are underdogs? Cincy has been a nice surprise not taking that away from them, but they have also benefited from an easy schedule. Temple has played a lot tougher schedule and I think they get the job done and aren't over looking Cincy here.",So the classic situation again with the ranked undefeated team catching a full TD? Colorado has played no one. Should we be impressed with them barely escaping @ Nebraska or beating ASU last week after ASU couldnt punch it in from the 1 yard line? USC is coming off their bye week setting up for a major rally the troops game. The talent level belongs to the Trojans and Coach Helton knows his job is on the line.,Miami is one of the most overrated teams in the country and love fading them here in this spot. They are coming off a huge win over their in state rival in Florida St who is down. They only won by 1 point as 2 touchdown favorites. If you have watched this Miami this season they dont pass the eye test and I think Virginia will want some big time revenge here in this night game. Virginia is also coming of their bye here with this one circled. I wouldn't be shocked if Virginia won outright,West Virginia has played one of the easiest schedules so far and I think they lose this game. Iowa St last weekend impressed me a ton as they went on the road and made a switch to their 3rd string QB Purdy who wasn't afraid of the moment and was the best player on the field. Iowa St will be up for this game here and they won't be scared as they have played a brutal tough schedule so far. They gave Oklahoma fits and that was the first week with their back up who was no good especially compared to this freshman. The team rallies around Purdy and they win outright,I like Cal in this game as last week was very misleading against Arizona. Cal dominated the stats against them but ended up losing. The price is right now as they want to take it out on UCLA as Cal needs win to get to a bowl game. UCLA is a bad team and they gave all they had last week vs Washington as they made a big come back but came up short losing by 7. Cal is the better team and the number is too good to pas up.,People all said that Oregon isn't impressive because they had played no one. While that may have been so I think they want to win that big one. A few weeks back they let that Stanford game slip away as they completely dominated it but ended up blowing a big lead in a weird change in that game. Oregon is coming off the bye as well which is huge.,Also how good is exactly Washington? So the week 1 Auburn game looks terrible now. They just won @ UCLA by only 7 and beat ASU by 7. This will be their toughest test by far and they simply dont deserve to be favored based on their performances this year,"Despite both thsese team have bad records I think Miami Oh is clearly the better team here. They have played a much tougher slate. They played a tough Marshall team, a surprisingly good Cincy team and @ Minnesota to start the year. I like last weeks performance blowing out Akron as an underdog. Kent St is just pathetic especially on defense allowing 6.7 yards per play. I also think Miami Oh is bowl hungry and they have this one circled as they let it slip away on the road losing by 3 as an 8.5 point favorite.",Eastern Michigan is a team no one is looking to back right now. They have lost 4 straight since upsetting Purdue as a double digit dog. EMU has lost 3 straight games by each 3 points which clearly they could have won have them undervalued here. EMU will also want revenge from a close loss last year. They won't have a problem moving on a terrible Toledo defense who give up 6.2 yards per play.,Another huge factor here is just look at the strength of schedule. The only two tough teams Toledo has played they were blown out. EMU has played 5 straight teams who will be going to bowl games this season. Wrong Team is favored here because of record,This is just too many points for me to pass up here. The only negative for me here is the fact this is played at night. I do think Vandy is a sneaky good team though with a very good defense. This Vandy team hung right in there on the road @ Notre Dame. This is a lot like last week where I dont see Georgia scoring 40 therefore if they dont then I need Vandy to get to 10 basically which I easily see happening. Georgia has a huge on deck game with LSU as well,I jumped on this one early as we have a highly ranked undefeated Kentucky team catching points? HMM... This is a night game in College Station in which they won't be over looking. The Aggies have two losses but were to Bama and Clemson to playoff teams. This is one of those that Kentucky gets behind early and simply cant play catch up. I trust Jimbo a lot more here and this is a big game for him now,So Colorado gets ranked this week because they are 4-0 and they have played such a terrible schedule. The wrong to me is favored here. Colorado has played Nebraska and UCLA as their toughest games and that isn't a joke.,ASU to me right now is the best PAC 12 south team. They have beat Michigan St lost by 7 @ SDSU and @ Washington. I think ASU knows the importance of this game right now to control the south. I think the Buffs stats are misleading due to the fact that their schedule has been so easy.,LSU is by far the most overrated team in the country. They are outside of my top 10 and therefore I will play Florida. Everyone knows both teams have a solid defense. LSU was extremely out played @ Auburn and that win actually doesn't look that great now. I trust Mullen here the head coach at Florida coming off back to back road conference wins which is very impressive. This is one of those statements games for a new coach to make his imprint and I believe they win this outright,Iowa St is in a world of trouble here this game I think. They failed to reach 200 total yards despite forcing 3 turnovers against TCU last week. Give them credit they hung tough but that score was misleading a bit. I also think this is the game where Oklahoma St scores a ton and the back up QB for Iowa isn't capable of putting up those type of points. Oklahoma St jumps on them early here and keeps the pedal down,"NC St isn't getting a lot of love here, but I do think they have the better talent here. They are lead by stud QB Finley who is one of the top QB prospects this year. He is airing it out right now and averaging 8.9 yards per attempt. The similar style BC faced to this team would have been @ Purdue and Purdue blew them out that game.",Last week BC had a misleading final against Temple as the Owls outgained them. They also struggled against a bad Wake Forest and team and as I mentioned were blown out by Purdue. This will be by far their toughest test and I think the Wolfpack destroys them,I will take Texas here as we have seen this same song and dance again in this game. Texas is coming in underrated and I think because they let the gas off the pedal last week @ Kansas St. The public now has a love affair with Murray the QB for OU but this will by far be his toughest test. I trust Herman here and we have seen the improvements as the season has gone along with Texas and their defense. OU has a pathetic defense that won't be able to stop Texas at all.,Well another great situational play here. Oregon is coming off a just a brutal loss to Stanford last week as they were dominating that game and let it slip away which is extremely hard to bounce back from. Throw in fact we have a much improved Cal team this season and they are coming off a bye I think the wrong team is favored here. Cal wins this game SU,I think Toledo is in over their heads here. This team is legit and they have play makers as we have already witnessed. They are also coming off a bye after a dominating win @ UCLA. Some other key factors here is that this will be Toledo's first road game and throw in the fact that this will be a super super late kick compared to east coast time for these kids which is a factor that goes under looked IMO. I think Fresno has their way with them from the start.,I look for the Sun Devils to be hungry here and blow out a bad Oregon St team. ASU is coming off two close losses but both of those were on the road. Herm has changed the culture down their and this team can still win the south. I think Oregon St is really deflated after last week because they probably thought that was their one chance to get a win.,Little upset I missed an earlier and better line but Notre Dame found a QB in Book and I dont think odds makers are making a big enough adjustment for him. Throw in the fact ND has dropped the past 2 games against Stanford I believe they have this one circled. Also Stanford is in a tough spot coming off a crazy win @ Oregon a game they shouldn't have been in at all and they used a ton of energy in that monster come back. I think Notre Dame wins easily,I think Iowa St is in a world of trouble here against TCU. The Horned Frogs will be extremely pissed after losing two in a row to Ohio St and @ Texas. Some will argue that this is a let down spot but I don't think it will be as they can still win conference. They also will want revenge as they had a game slip away from them @ Ames last season in one they should have won.,So a lot of people including myself may have pegged Washington St wrong as I though they would be the 2nd worst team in the conference. I think they are now getting too much respect because they have covered every game so far. I also love that Utah is coming off their bye week and will be more than motivated here as they want revenge from last year,I like Texas Tech here who seems to have figured out things out especially on defense. Texas Tech went into Oklahoma St last week as a two touchdown underdog and just throttled them. The most important thing is that they held them to 17 points. I love backing teams who won as a road dog and then return home as a home dog. They seem to ride the momentum when this happens and I believe Tech wins out right,With this line going up so much I have to take Eastern Michigan here. I was on the Aztecs last week in a SU winner as an underdog vs Arizona St. Now the spot and situation has flipped here.,SDSU as mentioned coming off that big win in a let down spot but more importantly have a big rivalry game with Boise St up next. EMU is no team to sleep on as they went into Purdue and won SU. I think Purdue is a better team and SDSU and with the lines nearly being the same I will take the points with a live dog here.,My only loss last week in college was going against LSU. I will go against them again here as I believe the motivation won't be there and this is a huge let down spot following a late second FG win over highly ranked Auburn on the road.,LA Tech is coming off a bye week so that is a big key as well. This team isn't a easy push over and they can move the ball averaging 6.9 yards per play. LSU also right now has some injuries on their defense and I don't expect them to be full strength and probably even sit a couple to get ready for all SEC play coming up. LA TECH is the right side here,UNLV is a much improved team here and I have already back them twice winning both times. This team will have no problem moving the ball on Arkansas St. I would also argue the talent level is better on the UNLV side of the ball. UNLV with nip and tuck with USC week 1 going into the 4th quarter. I know USC is down but still they have the athletes. Arkansas St was pretty fortunate to have a win last week as they were +2 in turnovers which was the difference in the game,"I have to take Texas AM here who I believe is the 3rd best team in the SEC behind Georgia, but I think it's close. With that, it's clear the Bama is now being way over valued. Clearly yet again they are the best team again in the country and have had no problems so far.","I dont expect Bama to have any problems here more or less, but at least the Aggies have proven themselves to compete with the best as they took Clemson down to the wire. Bama was favored less playing against Louisville and Ole Miss who are both a lot worse than Texas AM.",Bottom line this is simply way too many points and with what we have seen from Texas AM you have to take all the points,How interested will the Buckeyes be in this game after having a very hard fought battle against TCU where they were on the ropes? I'm guessing not very interested at all.,Ohio St doesn't face teams that run the option all that often so that is different for them to prepare for. Also Bosa their best defensive player is sitting out this game which does help Tulane a lot. This game similar to Clemson and GA Southern last week will be played on the ground and a fast clock. Ohio St classic sandwich spot with Penn St on deck.,I think we are getting a nice discount on Ball St here. I back this team two weeks ago @ Notre Dame as a 33.5 point dog and they only lost by 8. I will give WKU a little credit here as they should have won against Louisville as it was a misleading final.,The main thing here for me is that WKU is without their starting QB here. I also like the fact that Ball St lost to WKU last year so revenge is for sure on their mind. WKU already has their struggles on offense only averaging 16 ppg. Ball St is averaging 450 yards per game and I dont see them having any issues here.,I will bite here and take Virginia who I think is vastly improved especially on offense. They are averaging nearly 450 yards per game and 6.7 yards per play. Virginia is still be underrated by the odds makers here as they have covered every game so far.,Louisville I think most are giving a pass too because they have played Bama and got blown out like everyone else has. Well they haven't covered a spread yet this season and should have lost last week as they were completely out played by Western Kentucky.,I think Ohio who is one of the better teams in the MAC is similar to Louisville they handled them easily winning by 14.,"Here is a weird line and an over reaction. I had Arizona St last week and they pulled the upset over Michigan St. Well, after seeing Sparty struggle week 1 vs Utah St and now @ ASU you have to wonder how overrated they are. Also, ASU was projected by Vegas with a 4.5 win total this season, which means they were underdogs in this game at the start of the season. Now just after 2 games they are favored on the road? Maybe they are just this much better but this is a huge overreaction IMO and I will take the live dog",This is a much bigger game for Texas here now after laying an egg to Maryland in week 1 and just edging by Tulsa last week. Herman knows the importance of this game as simply he was brought into this position to compete and win these types and he has underachieved so far. USC is clearly rebuilding after they struggled week 1 vs UNLV and last week @ Stanford. Texas has revenge on their minds and they get it done this weekend,I think this Buffalo team is being underrated in the MAC this season. They have returned a good nucleus from last season and the spot here is what really intrigues me.,EMU is getting way too much credit for beating Purdue last as that was misleading because Purdue out gained them but EMU won the turnover battle. It is also worth noting that game was played in some bad weather as well.,More or less I think Buffalo is a play on team here as they will be under valued for several weeks.,"I truly believe the line tells the story here. I'm not buying that LSU win over Miami at all in the first week. First, it was a little misleading as Miami actually out gained them in the game and LSU won the turnover battle 2-0.","The next thing is, how good do we truly believe Miami is? Well I don't think they are that good this season but since they were ranked high LSU gets all the credit here.",I was very impressed with Auburn week 1 vs a very good Washington team. Their defense will get after the one dimensional LSU offense here. Auburn was a 6 point favorite on the road last year and lost now the revenge will play a factor. I think Auburn destroys them.,"I was against Notre Dame last weekend in a win as they struggled with Ball St. Granted they werent that interested in the game, but this week they better show up. Vandy looks improved big time so far this season and the main reason is because of their offense. Midd Tenn and Nevada are smaller schools, but they aren't exactly dumpster fires and Vandy really put it to them. I dont think Vandy gets blown out and their defense alone will keep them with a great chance to pull the upset IMO",Is there anything good to say so far about this Florida St team? I sure dont think so. They just gave up 475 yards in the air to Samford and only won by 10. Cuse has revenge on their minds from last season blowing a game @ FSU. Cuse will have no problem here putting up the points and they should be favored IMO.,"This was on I had circled coming into the week. GA Southern isn't world beaters everyone knows that, but they have played well so far covering both games. They run the option and that is the reason I like them here because they are going to be having the hurricane weather roll through. With the weather I expect this game to be played a lot on the ground.",Also throw in the fact that Clemson just came off a thrilling win @ Texas AM last week. This isn't the most ideal spot for them. The motivation won't be there to blow them out as well. I expect this number to drop as we go along,".mailpoet_hp_email_label{display:none}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_form{}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_paragraph{line-height:20px}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_segment_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_text_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_textarea_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_select_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_radio_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_checkbox_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_list_label, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_date_label{display:block;font-weight:bold}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_text, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_textarea, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_select, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_date_month, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_date_day, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_date_year, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_date{display:block}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_text, #mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_textarea{width:100%;border-radius:4px;border:1px solid #dce4ec;font-size:15px;padding:10px}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_checkbox{}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_submit input{}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_divider{}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_message{}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_validate_success{font-weight:600;color:#468847}#mailpoet_form_2 .mailpoet_validate_error{color:#b94a48} Please leave this field emptyCheck your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.",Check your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.,CLICK HERE TO BECOME A PREMIUM MEMBER - FOR FREE,LOW VIG HIGH LIMITS,BONUS: 50% UP TO $1000,BONUS: 50% UP TO $1000,BONUS: 50% UP TO $1000,BONUS: 50% UP TO $1000,BONUS: 100% UP TO $300,BONUS: 100% UP TO $500,BONUS: 50% UP TO $250,LOW MARGIN BEST ODDS,BITCOIN SPORTSBOOK,Copyright © 2019,Enter your email below to receive free picks and special offers straight to your inbox.

Car parking fine especially earlier in the day as gets pretty busy at weekends, cyclists not always terribly aware of animals running free so if going at the weekend go earlier in the day.

"December 16, 2018 Dwayne Fernandes Soccer Scoops, Sports Scoops 0","This is what the English Premier League (EPL) Super Sundays are all about. Stay at home relax and be entertained by some amazing football action in England. And that’s exactly what happened in today’s game between Liverpool and Manchester United at Old Trafford, with the former winning 3-1 thanks mainly to second-half substitute player, Xherdan Shaqiri.","At one point in the first half, it looked like Liverpool were a class apart, threatening to take the game away early and scoring 7-8 goals today. However, they only managed one goal and due to a small goal-keeping mistake, they allowed a goal back, with the teams going into half-time, 1-1, but Liverpool still strong favourites. medianet_width = ""300""; medianet_height = ""250""; medianet_crid = ""336935426""; medianet_versionId = ""3111299"";","The first 15-20 minutes of the 2nd half saw a little bit of resistance from Manchester United as well as a couple of wasted chances. However, Jurgen Klopp brought on Switzerland’s Xherdan Shaqiri and this little man was on the ball right away, ending the night as the hero, scoring not one, but two match-winning goals during his limited time on the pitch.","Two shots, both deflections, but both going past David de Gea made Shaqiri the hero as he scored in the 73rd minute and then in the 80th minutes. When you look at the statistics of the game, it was all Liverpool from the start, with a total of 36-6 shots during the game, while they also led the corners count, 13-2. Let’s not forget they also held over 60% of the ball possession. medianet_width = ""300""; medianet_height = ""250""; medianet_crid = ""336935426""; medianet_versionId = ""3111299""; Liverpool beat Manchester United 3-1 when the final whistle blew and they continued an unbelievable run of 18 unbeaten games in the English Premier League. With 17 games in the bag they have leap-frogged over Manchester City to top the table with 45 points at the moment, which is a massive 19 points over Manchester United at the moment.","A little bit of luck for Liverpool as both goals at the end were deflections, but let’s not forget that they were a class apart tonight, dominating since the start.

"Typical transport investment and policy proposals in India may consider factors such as connectivity with surrounding areas, land use and socioeconomic impacts, available funding, and the level of support from local stakeholders. All too often, these assessments consistently overlook the health impacts of transport. Despite this, there is a consistent and powerful connection between transport and health. This issue brief aims to develop an appropriate methodology for assessing the health impacts from urban transportation projects, plans, and policies in the Indian context.",Note: this publication was updated June 2014.,"Typical transportation investment or policy proposals in India may consider evaluation factors such as connectivity with surrounding areas, land use and socioeconomic impacts, funding availability and commitment, and stakeholder support constraints. However they overlook one important factor: health impacts of transportation.","Rapid motorization of Indian cities has led to a public health crisis in the form of increased traffic injuries and fatalities, exposure to air and noise pollution, and decreased physical activity among many other adverse health and environmental impacts. There is thus an urgent need to assess health impacts of transportation prior to project implementation to better inform decision makers how to maximize the benefits and minimize the negative impacts on health. This also requires increased engagement and discussion between public health professionals and urban transport professionals, an objective that this Issue Brief aims to accomplish.","Health Impact Assessment (HIA) methodologies and tools have been used extensively in the developed world primarily to support broader environmental impact assessments of projects, programs, and policies, but only recently in the transportation sector. The concept of conducting an HIA has now started to gain traction in the developing world. Unfortunately, much of the methodology and indicators are specific to a developed world context.","This issue brief aims to develop an appropriate methodology for assessing the health impacts from urban transportation projects, plans, and policies in the Indian context. Through a review of the literature and expert input from transportation planners and public health professionals, we first identified the HIA typologies and health impacts relevant to the transportation sector in India. We then developed a methodology to conduct HIAs focusing on modal shift and vehicle kilometers traveled for Indian cities, where measurement of health outcomes can be difficult and resource-intensive. We applied the methodology and evidence gathered through the review to the City of Indore, Madhya Pradesh to evaluate the health impacts of the recently implemented BRT corridor in the city. We estimate that about 19 lives can be saved per year after 2014, accounting for the reduction fatalities from reduction in private motorized VKT, reduction in air pollution exposure, and health benefits from increased physical activity. Finally, we present recommendations and conclusions on the importance of integrating health benefits into urban transportation planning and policy in India.",Register to Receive Our News and Announcements Subscribe,"10 G Street NE Suite 800Washington, DC 20002, USA",Phone +1 (202) 729-7600Fax +1 (202) 729-7610

USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin,"Green Bay Packers general manager Ted Thompson, left, and President and CEO Mark Murphy enter Lambeau Field for the annual shareholders meeting in July 2015.(Photo: Jim Matthews/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)","GREEN BAY - Mark Murphy says he has a good idea of how long Ted Thompson plans to work as the Green Bay Packers’ general manager, but he hasn’t decided on Thompson’s successor when that time comes.","Murphy, the Packers’ president and CEO, wouldn’t say how long he expects Thompson to remain on the job though he endorsed his GM in a lengthy interview this week.",Murphy also wouldn’t comment on whether he has talked to Thompson about a contract extension. Thompson’s contract reportedly runs through the 2018 season. In January of 2019 he’ll turn 66.,"“There will be a plan in place for the process to find a successor,” Murphy said.","The Packers have several candidates on staff who could succeed Thompson, starting with Eliot Wolf, who as director-football operations is Thompson’s highest-ranking scout. Wolf, 34, interviewed for GM jobs this offseason with the San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts.","Russ Ball, the team’s vice president of football operations, is another candidate on staff. As is Brian Gutekunst, director of player personnel, who also interviewed for the San Francisco job.","But Murphy said he does not advocate anointing anyone as the Packers’ GM in waiting, either in writing or by oral agreement, because the NFL is too a fluid business.","“Things change so quickly I don’t want to tie the organization’s hands,” Murphy said. “And whether that would be permitted under the Rooney Rule, I’m not sure about that. But I don’t think it’s good business anyway.”",Murphy said Thompson’s and coach Mike McCarthy’s jobs never were in jeopardy during the Packers’ four-game losing streak in their just-completed season.,"“We were 4-6,” Murphy said, “but I think as an organization we didn’t panic and in my mind you don’t make decisions like that in the middle of the season. You see the season play out, and obviously things changed quite a bit.”","Murphy said he thinks the Packers’ continuity at GM and coach are a big reason for the franchise’s run of eight straight playoff berths, and four appearances in the NFC championship game since Thompson and McCarthy started working together in 2006.","He is aware of the argument from some fans and observers that Thompson has taken the team as far as he can with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, and that for the Packers to take full advantage of Rodgers’ final seasons they need to replace him.","“I know that Ted is an excellent GM,” Murphy said, “and (if) we make a change, there’s no guarantees. The consistent level of success that we have achieved is very difficult to do in the NFL, so I wouldn’t want to just throw that out for the chance that maybe things would be better with a different GM.”"

And he did it in style earning the men's slalom gold on home waters in Toronto in 1953. The Ontario capital was the first Canadian city to host the water skiing worlds.,"Blackwell started water skiing rather late at age 17 in 1948 but within two years he was winning tournaments on a consistent basis including the world crown and three Canadian titles. At Expo '67 in Montreal, he was awarded a special gold medal for his world triumph.","He worked 33 years for Kodak of Canada then purchased and operated Pointe au Baril Marina near his cottage at Harris Lake, Ont.",His wife Mary Lou pre-deceased him in 1991 and Charles Blackwell passed away in 1994. They had four daughters including twins.,"''Dad was always proud of everything he did,'' said his youngest daughter Sandra Blackwell. ''Water skiing gave him some wonderful adventures, though he was never into boasting about his accomplishments. He taught us all to ski but never pushed, just taught.""",,Charles Seward Blackwell Jr. will forever be known as Canada's first water ski world champion.,"Charlie Blackwell was a Canadian pioneer in the sport. He became the first athlete from this country to win a gold medal (slalom) against athletes from many other countries at the World Championships held in Toronto. This event was the first of three World Championships to be held in Canada and his success was the inspiration for other Canadian World Champions to follow - George Athans, Pat Messner, Joel McClintock, Judy McClintock, Jaret Llewellyn, and the Canadian Team - 1st ever to defeat from 1991 to 1995 the powerful water skiers from the U.S., who had forever reigned as the best water skiers in the world. But Charlie Blackwell was the ""first"" and his 1953 success pointed the way to the future.",Charlie Blackwell also played a quiet background role in the development of Canada's top position in world water skiing. He served on the executive of the Canadian Water Ski Association (now Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada) and was editor of the sports newsletter.,"In his hometown of Owen Sound, Charlie learned to ski beginning in 1948 at age 17, with coach ""Hump"" Taylor. Within two years he was competing in, and winning, tournaments. He went on to win three Canadian championships, the slalom gold medal at the 1953 World Championships held in Toronto, and to ski in various tournaments and shows at Cypress Gardens as well as the CNE ski show.","Charlie was a quiet, unassuming man who didn't boast of his many accomplishments. A 1950 story relates that Charlie, as a grade 13 student, initially declined a trip to the World Championships at Cypress Gardens: He thought it might interfere too much with his school work. But the officials of the meet cabled him urging his acceptance and he finally accepted.","By 1958 Blackwell had to curtail his CNE show skiing when his twin girls were born. Charlie worked for Kodak of Canada for 33 years, eventually retiring from that job but then purchasing and operating Pointe au Baril Marina near the family cottage on Harris Lake. At the cottage he taught his four daughters to ski - they were amazed that dad skied but never got wet - and from the marina he took a hand in advising many more would-be skiers how to get going. ""We never felt we had to surpass him"", says 4th daughter Sandra Blackwell. ""He never pushed, he just taught.""","He would relate only snippets of his athletic prowess to his family, preferring to tell unassuming stories, like the time he skied into a boathouse and broke his nose. In 1967, Charlie accepted an invitation to attend Expo '67 in Montreal, taking along his young family, and accepted a gold medal recognizing his triumph of fourteen years earlier. This event was the first clue his children got that their dad had ever done anything 'special'.","He went on skiing at the cottage until he was in his mid-50's. His wife, Mary Lou, died in August 1991, by which time the four daughters (Robin, Carol, Karen and Sandra) had given Charlie over ten grandchildren. Sandra reports Charlie wished for 'an even dozen', a wish which later came true. But eventually Charlie developed cancer, and died March 28, 1994. Three days before the end, he told Sandra that he could never complain about leaving because his life had been such an adventure - and he was ready for his next adventure.","Jeremy Kovak is a pioneer in wakeboarding, which is regarded today as one of the world's fastest growing water sports. Now only 30-years-old, he enjoyed a stellar career on the pro circuit and was a responsible for the maple leaf flying highest at competitions around the world.","In 1993, Kovak became the first Canadian to win a world wakeboard title (which he repeated in 1997) and in 1997 captured the World Cup crown as well. He has also triumphed at Masters, the X-Games and the World Extreme Cup. He posted more than 30 wins on the Pro Tour. During those years he had a heated and popular rivalry with American Darren Shapiro.","''Wakeboarding is in an exciting period right now and sometimes I wish I was still competing,'' said Kovak. ''It's just getting bigger and bigger. I think the appeal for the youngsters is that it's an extreme sport and has so many variables. They're really into the sport and are also real fans of the sport. I got involved initially because I loved doing flips and doing acrobatics in general.''","Kovak was also a star on the Canadian junior water ski team from 1988 to 1991 earning the world junior crown in 1990.

Steve taught Beth the foundation which led to many successes. Steve also showed her that to be a success it is not only about talent. She had to be prepared for hard work, training, dedication and focus which was imperative to accomplishing the goals that they mapped out together. Beth would travel back and forth to Florida to train when not in school in Montreal.","Eventually Beth learned to jump with the coaching of Mike Siepel and Casey Scalise.

Born to Doctor J.P. McClintock (D.D.S.) and Joyce McClintock, Judy is the youngest of five children and the only girl.","Judy grew up in a very competitive environment with four brothers, three of whom are also avid waterskiers. With an early start to waterskiing at age 3 and a competitive career starting at age 8, Judy showed promise to being one of Canada's elite athletes.","By age 10, Judy, known affectionately as Buff because of her resemblance to Buffy in t.v.'s Family Affair, was competing and winning at the national level. There was no turning back. Judy rapidly progressed through all levels of competition and consistently came out on top, even in fields of competitors much her senior in age and experience.","Judy was showing signs of her world champion potential. In 1979 McClintock represented Canada at the World Championships. She would continue this responsibility for the next 16 years, skiing in more World Championships than any other athlete in the sport. By the mid '80s, Judy was strongly established as an International force, having won the prestigious U.S. Masters overall title and trick title in 1981 as well as many other Pan American and World medals.","In 1985, Judy proved herself the best in the world by winning the gold medal in women's tricks at the World Championships in Toulouse, France. Having reached that pinnacle that few athletes ever achieved Judy could have easily rationalized retirement. By then she had married, supported her husband's efforts to start their own fitness business in Northampton, Massachusetts and was looking forward to starting a family. She did all of the above except retire!","From 1985 onward, Judy had her hands full. She would now be a part time athlete while being a full time businesswoman and mother. And as would be expected Judy excelled at all three. With new priorities in life, Judy the mature athlete wisely focused on select goals.","There were only two things left for Judy McClintock Messer in the sport of waterskiing. The prestigious World Overall Title and the seemingly impossible World Team Title. To date the U.S. had dominated as a team, having never in 40 years of competition, been defeated in the World Championships. In 1991 history was made and Judy reduced her goals by one when Team Canada won the World Team Title in Austria.","Again, to the waterski world, Judy had done it all and this would be the opportune time for this busy and worldly women to bow out. But Judy Messer, like few other athletes, recognizes the inner need beyond the desire to win. Judy is and always has been a contributor. And now a critical part of the World Champion Team this was not the time for Judy to quit. Judy went on to be a prominent member of the 1993 Canadian Team which defended its world title. By 1995, at age 31, many thought Judy had accomplished everything and contributed generously and would surely change her priorities and not show up to perform at the 1995 World Championships.",What these people hadn't considered was that Judy's priorities had changed many years before and that in fact it was her peace of mind combined with unparallel discipline and focus that made it possible to continue to compete among the best in the world even as a part time athlete. 1995 was a year of unprecedented focus for Judy. From early in the season you could see in her eyes that deep inside she had the burning desire and more importantly truly believed that she had the ability to win the coveted world overall title that was the only fragment of prestige and honor that had eluded this champion.,"Judy is the epitome of modesty. Never has she or would she talk about this being her year, but somehow, through an air of confidence that Judy exuded throughout the season we knew that she knew that it was her year. And so it was.",Judy pre-empted the World's by using the Canadian Nationals as a stepping-stone at which she managed a clean sweep with gold medals in each of the three events to defend her national overall title. Judy flew to France with the Canadian Team for a week of training to acclimatize and fine tune for the big event. Training went flawlessly. Judy was on track. She went into competition with a level of confidence that even this seasoned athlete had never enjoyed.,"From her first event on the water things went great and just kept getting better. Messer was the only female athlete to qualify for the finals in all three disciplines. On Sunday, September 17, 1995, Judy Messer reached yet another pinnacle in the sport of waterskiing as she was crowned World Overall Champion.",Having achieved this honor Judy also established some firsts. Judy is the first Canadian woman to win the World Overall Title. Judy and her brother / teammate / coach Joel McClintock are the first sister and brother to have both won World Titles.

The Urban Transport Group has today welcomed the Government’s intention to open up data on bus services and to ensure the provision of audio visual information for bus passengers – but said it has major concerns about how the plan is to be funded and implemented at a time when local government funding is being cut.,"The proposals – which are set out in two consultations on bus open data and accessible information – are designed to ensure that bus users in England have better times, fares and real-time information for their journeys, and that buses have audio visual announcements to improve the travel experience for visually impaired passengers, the deaf or hard of hearing, those with cognitive impairments, autism, or mental illnesses.","In its response to the consultations, the Urban Transport Group called for a ring-fenced funding from Government to support both open data and the implementation of audio visual equipment. The response points out that since 2010-11, there has been a 46% reduction in funding for supported bus services in England, and the requirement to install audio visual announcement systems (which can cost up to £4,000 per bus including audio recordings) could put additional pressure on budgets for supported services.",The Urban Transport Group also called for:,"Mick Noone, Director of Integrated Transport at Merseytravel and lead Board member for bus at the Urban Transport Group, said:","“We fully support the Government’s aims to allow bus passengers to make informed travel decisions based on complete, accurate and timely data, and for disabled people to have the information they need to travel safely and with confidence.",“But we have significant concerns about the way the Department for Transport intends to roll out these plans. That is why we are calling for more quality control of data and ring-fenced funding to assist transport authorities in implementing these new obligations – funding which is imperative if they are to deliver bus services that meet the needs of their passengers.”,Read the Urban Transport Group’s response to the bus open data and accessible information consultations.,Your e-mail address will not be published.

"With Brayden Schnur’s runner up finish at the New York Open this past week, Canada now has five men ranked in the top 110. This is a statistic never seen before to my knowledge. I had the pleasure of watching Brayden warm up at the Calgary Tennis Club a couple years back and play the Challenger Tour event here last fall. He has the physique, the strokes and the drive to win.

His results haven’t measured up to expectations but he has not given up. For those lower ranked players keen to keep their players card and gaining a spot in the draw, it oftentimes means qualifying rounds. This is what we don’t hear much about. These are those matches played in the outback of the resort grounds sometimes at odd hours and periodically with wonderment whether the dream will be whisked away.","Two new rising Canadian stars have bumped Frank from the dialogue of Canadian tennis, but i see he has not only made it through three rounds of qualifying at this year’s U.S. Open, but he won his first round match in the main draw today and now meets a wiley veteran in Tommy Robredo.",Something Good is Gonna Happen Frank!

"Sometimes you just can’t make this stuff up. Chelsea’s 2-1 victory over Manchester United featured so many highlights during and after the match that at times it was quite breathtaking. If the Premier League needed a jab in the arm to restore the faith of fans after awful performances by English sides in Europe, this was it. A match between two massive clubs during the biggest week of the season for the top English teams.",Here are my random thoughts about the match:,"Thankfully, this was one of those Premier League matches that actually lived up to its billing. Full of drama and wonderful skill played at a high-speed tempo. And, for the neutral fan, the result means that the Premier League title race is now wide open.

"A Long Time Until Next Fall The soccer fans who want to fill up on the sport before hieing into retirement for the long summer months, will have their last opportunity on Saturday afternoon when the Bethlehem Steel F. C., National champions, close shop on the home field with J & P Coats as the opponents. The game will mark the close of a highly successful season, not simply because Bethlehem Steel annexed the National championship, but rather because of the enthusiasm experienced wherever soccer was played. Most encouraging was the popularity of the sport this season and which is promised when the clubs launch their 1926-27 campaigns. Attendance records were eclipsed right and left, better teams were produced and the fans treated to a high grade of soccer. With Saturday's game off the boards, fans will have to content themselves with the summer sports now in full sing. The Steelmen, as well as practically every other club, will disband for the summer, but will be called out for training the latter part of August. Preparations will be made for an early fall start. 1925-1926 Bethlehem Steel Soccer Club"
Jelena Ostapenko and Maria Sharapova meet in the quarterfinals of the 2018 tennis Rome Masters.,"Jelena Ostapenko is coming off a three sets win over Johanna Konta that took 27 games to decide. In the victory, Ostapenko won 78 percent of her first serve points and 52 percent of her second serve points. Ostapenko was able to rebound after dropping the first set 2-6, as she won 64 percent of her service points and overcame seven double faults. Ostapenko obviously has to play cleaner tennis to make a deeper run, but this has been the story of her season. It’s not always pretty for Ostapenko and can be sloppy, but she digs deep and finds ways to win more times than not. Ostapenko hopes to make the semifinal of a WTA Premier 5 Tournament for the third time in her career. Ostapenko has won 10 of her last 12 matches on clay court.","Maria Sharapova is coming off a straight sets win over Daria Gavrilova that took 19 games to decide. In the victory, Sharapova won 56 percent of her first serve points and 53 percent of her second serve points. Sharapova struggled to pull away, but she came away with seven breaks and grinded out yet another victory. Sharapova has played a lot of tennis to get to this point after two long three set matches, but she’s coming off her most complete performance of the tournament and continues to show signs of getting her feet under her and gaining confidence. Sharapova has now made back-to-back quarterfinal appearances, which is a sign she’s starting to come along. Sharapova has won six of her last eight quarterfinal appearances. Sharapova hopes to make a semifinal of a WTA Premier 5 Tournament for the first time since the 2015 Italian Open. Sharapova has won seven of her last nine matches on clay court.",This will be the first match between these two players.,"While Sharapova is playing well, I still need to see more from her, as she’s not Sharapova from a few years back and still has issues putting away her opponents. Because of that and the fighting spirit of Ostapenko, I have to fade Sharapova in this match. If Sharapova isn’t on her game and ready to play a back and forth contest, she’s going home. And based on her struggles at time this season, and not able to close matches easily, she’s hard to trust against top tier players.","This will be tight, but I give the edge to Ostapenko.","Randy Chambers has been with Sports Chat Place since 2014 and covers everything from the NFL to WNBA and tennis.

"View image | gettyimages.com By Sam Field 656. That is the number of wins that Martin Brodeur has amassed over his storied NHL career. Many people believe that Brodeur tarnished some of his legacy by moving on to another team, however that couldn’t be more false. Martin Brodeur will go down as one of the greatest goalies to ever strap on the pads. He has more wins, shutouts, and minutes played than anyone, and he has three Stanley Cup rings to show for it. This week Brodeur announced that he was hanging up the skates for retirement, and in effect signaled the end of an era. Brodeur spent the first 21 years of his storied career with the New Jersey Devils organization, but after the team made a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft for Corey Schneider, it became apparent that the Devils had started looking towards the future. After one final year with the Devils, sharing the crease with Schneider, Brodeur announced that he would test free agency in the summer of 2014. After being unable to sign with a team prior to the season beginning, Brodeur continued to stay in shape hoping a team would come calling. Brodeur wanted to go to a team with a chance of having playoff success, chasing that ever elusive 4th Stanley Cup. When Brian Elliott of the St. Louis Blues went down with an injury, an opportunity opened for Brodeur and he signed a contract to play the season in St. Louis. However, after moderate success with the Blues, they continually elected to go with Jake Allen in between the pipes. Once Elliott returned earlier this month, the writing was on the wall for Brodeur. He was regularly slotted in the 3rd goalie position, and continually scratched until he announced his retirement this week. Although his drive for a 4th ring turned out to be a futile one, he has managed to maintain a lasting impact on hockey this season, and for years to come. He has even signed on to be a senior advisor to the general manager for the Blues. Many fans in New Jersey and the hockey community believe that a part of Brodeur’s legacy is now a bit tarnished because of his departure. True, many people wanted to see him retire as a Devil. However, Brodeur believed that he had more left in the tank and he wanted to empty it out. His stat line this season was a respectable, .899 SV% and a 2.87 GAA while posting 3 wins and 1 SO in 7 games played. Although those numbers are not on par with the gaudy numbers that he put up in his previous years, they are still respectable. Martin Brodeur’s inspired play night in and night out will forever be engrained in the minds of Devils’ fans, and in the nightmares of other teams’ fans who had trouble sleeping because of the hauntingly incredible saves Brodeur seemed to make every game. Martin Brodeur will go down as one of the legends, a sure­fire first ballot hall-of-famer, and a hero to so many young kids that grew up watching him play. Now, his legacy is greater than ever because Marty gave it all he could, and finally after parts of 22 seasons, the tank is empty.",View image | gettyimages.com,By Sam Field,"656.

Call Us: 801-613-8205,"Posted by Former NBA Coach Barry Hecker on January 12, 2014","As an assistant to coach Bill Fitch, I have had the opportunity to learn many of the fundamentals of the game, with special emphasis on the shooting skills and footwork. It is interesting to note that whenever a player goes up to the foul line, he will invariably go through a pre-shot routine in which he will place his shooting hand on the ball with the fingertips perpendicular to the seams. The ball, when held in this position, will usually rotate (spin) in a straight arc to the basket. My question is this: Why do so many of the players who shoot properly from the foul line change their technique when they shoot from the field? ""S"" For Spin Take an outstanding player like Terry Dehere. At Seton Hall, he set the all-time scoring record for the Big East, although he shot the ball with a side spin. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, we suggested that he change his shooting technique. With hard work, repetition, and concentration on the correct technique, Terry began shooting a ball that spun straight and true - raising his shooting percentage from 29.4% to 44.0% from the three-point arc and 40.7% to 49.0% from the field. The over spin gave his shot the so-called ""shooter's bounce"" - a shot that hits the front of the rim and drops into the basket, thanks to the proper rotation on the ball. Brent Barry, a rookie last season, is another player who improved his shooting by making a daily practice habit of ""seaming it"". Watch some of the great shooters in the NBA, such as Reggie Miller, Mark Price, Jeff Hornacek, Hersey Hawkins, and Chris Mullin. All have good rotation because they shoot with the seams. ""S"" For Stop Another aspect of shooting that has to be addressed is what I call ""stopping and tempo."" Every good NBA shooter is aware of the importance of good technique. But, though they may work hard on their hands and arms, they will often neglect their feet, and it can hurt their shooting technique. In order to square up with the target, the shooter must be able to come to a quick stop with his feet correctly spaced. That will create a base from which to launch the shot. (Remember, the shot starts from the ground up.) The feet should be set preferably shoulder-width apart and slightly staggered, depending on the hand with which the shot is taken. Michael Jordan has an uncanny ability to stop on balance and go right into the shot, with his shoulders square to the basket. Every shooter in the game should take the time to study Michael's footwork. The farther the shooter is from the basket, the more centered his balance and tempo must be. The shooter must not only establish a proper base, but should shoot with a consistent tempo. How many times have you seen a player shoot too quickly? This is invariably caused by lifting and releasing the ball too quickly, thus failing to give the body time to maintain balance and to shoot with a steady tempo. The best analogy I can make is a golfer who takes his club back too fast and thus fails to give his body the time to balance up and swing the club properly on the downswing. What he does, in essence, is fail to create the tempo and balance. In raising or lifting the basketball, it is essential to keep the arms close to the body - never extend them too far from the body. The extended position will create a weak shooting position, poor balance, and an inconsistent tempo. You can compare this lifting of the ball to the motion of a military press in weight lifting. You must keep the bar close to the mid-line of the body. If you move it too far away, you are going to lose control, balance, and strength. The same thing happens in shooting. You must raise the ball in a steady, rhythmic motion. Observe a Chris Mullin, Steve Kerr, Reggie Miller, Or Dennis Scott. Their feet are invariably set and their delivery totally fluid. Plus, they all shoot with the seams. ""S"" For Sight The final area of shooting that requires study is the eyes. Watch an NBA or college game, and observe the shooter's eyes at the foul line. One player will sight in on the target or rim, while another will wrongly follow the flight of the ball. Balance is an integral aspect of shooting and it will become difficult to maintain if you watch the flight of the ball. If, as you release, they ball, you follow it with your eyes, you will invariably cause your head to lift, move back or do both. That will cause the body weight or balance to transfer back, and you will end up with your weight on the back of your heels. Result: a low elbow release that will often product a shot that will hit the front rim (short). Since the low elbow is difficult to lift up, the shooting tempo will also be affected. An analogy may be drawn to shooting a gun. You must sight in and keep your eyes on the target and head still as you squeeze the trigger. Study your shooters and see if they have any problems with the seams, stop and tempo, or the eyes areas. One of the most satisfying and gratifying coaching moments lies in instructing a player on a certain technique and then watching him or her execute it perfectly with the game on the line! - by Former NBA Coach Barry Hecker Please add a comment:","As an assistant to coach Bill Fitch, I have had the opportunity to learn many of the fundamentals of the game, with special emphasis on the shooting skills and footwork.","It is interesting to note that whenever a player goes up to the foul line, he will invariably go through a pre-shot routine in which he will place his shooting hand on the ball with the fingertips perpendicular to the seams.","The ball, when held in this position, will usually rotate (spin) in a straight arc to the basket.

"Retired Utah Utes football coach Ron McBride and his family have filed a lawsuit against a Murray dog kennel, accusing the facility of negligence for letting their German shepherd get mauled to death by two aggressive dogs.","According to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Third District Court in Salt Lake City, the incident happened May 1, when Ron McBride and his wife, Vicky, along with daughter Kelly Redican and her husband, Mark, were hosting a wedding for friends at their house. The family decided to board their three dogs — Coach, a Labrador retriever; Flipper, a golden retriever/poodle mix; and Christa, a 10-year-old purebred German shepherd — so they wouldn’t go unsupervised during the ceremony.","Kelly Redican researched pet facilities, the lawsuit says, and chose Unleashed Dog Hotel in Murray. Unleashed’s website promised “our highly trained staff is present 24/7,” which the McBrides say was important for Christa, who tended to sleep more than play.",The lawsuit says Christa was left sleeping in an enclosed play area when Unleashed personnel moved the other dogs out. The employees then let two dogs into the area. The owner of those dogs warned the facility that they “were dog-aggressive and ‘ganged up’ on other dogs.”,"The other dogs were left with Christa, unsupervised, for 35 minutes, the lawsuit says. In that time, the dogs attacked Christa, dragged her around the room and mauled her until she died.","Later that afternoon, during the wedding, Unleashed’s owner, Billy Meadows, contacted Mark Redican with the news of Christa’s death. Mark Redican sought an incident report and video footage of the incident, that were never provided.","When he called Unleashed back to arrange transportation of Christa’s body, an employee said the kennel had already disposed of the dog’s remains. When pressed, the lawsuit says, Meadows “became hostile and started yelling at Mark on the phone.”","The McBride family — Ron and Vicky McBride, the Redicans and the McBride’s daughter Jill Baxter and her husband John (who originally owned Christa) are plaintiffs in the case — report they were “overcome with shock and grief” at Christa’s death. Also, the dog’s death “entirely ruined the wedding and guests were shocked and horrified” at the news, the lawsuit says.","On June 29, Mark Redican posted about the incident on Facebook. The lawsuit says Meadows left a note of apology at the McBride house the same day — the only contact Meadows had with the family since Christa’s death.","The family is accusing Unleashed of negligence, gross negligence, negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation and breach of contract. They are seeking unspecified damages, to be determined at trial, for costs associated with Christa’s death, emotional distress and punitive damages.",A call to Unleashed seeking comment was not immediately returned Wednesday.,This story will be updated.,spmeans@sltrib.com

"Posted by: mindoversports on: January 5, 2017","If you think you are committed to making a certain event happen in your life – and yet have done nothing about it – then you are kidding yourself. Taking action may involve risk you may not yet be prepared to take. Also, look at your commitment. When formulating your answer, did you use the words “hope” or “try”? If you did, keep this in mind: When you are committed, there is no such word in the human language as “hope” or “try”. Either you are committed or you’re not committed. It’s somewhat like being a little pregnant. Either you are or you aren’t.","If you ever hear a coach say, or read in the newspaper where he says, “We’re going to try to win this game” – forget it – he’s not committed to winning. In fact, he doesn’t believe his team can win. And do you think his team picks that up from him? Absolutely. There’s no way he can hide it. So, if you ever hear someone tell you that they are committed to making a certain event happen in their life, and they say “I hope such-and-such happens,” they, themselves, are not convinced that it will happen.","When Joe Namath was quarterback for the N.Y. Jets, he didn’t say we hope to win or we’re going to try to win the Super Bowl. He said: “We are going to win the Super Bowl.. We are going to win.” Total commitment. And when Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers recently said “I feel like we can run the table,” he didn’t say were are going to “try” to run the table, or we “hope” to run the table.","Beginning the 1997-98 NBA season, there was a cloud hovering above the Chicago Bulls that included: coach Phil Jackson’s status and the dissension between the players and management. But even with an uncertainty of the future, Michael Jordan expressed total commitment to winning by saying: “When we win the championship, I think we’ll see the road we took and look back at this sixth championship and appreciate this as being the most important championship we won…just because of the cards we’ve been dealt.” In his statement, Jordan used the word “championship” three times in one sentence and clearly stated when we win, rather than if we win. Was Jordan committed to the 1997-98 season? Absolutely. And his commitment affected the entire team in a positive way.

"Sports foods and drinks often rely on fructose as a key carbohydrate fuel ingredient. Yet studies show that up to 40% of athletes have fructose malabsorption, which causes gas, bloating, and other gross GI issues.",Sound familiar?,"Fructose is a FODMAP carbohydrate and it’s very common among processed sports foods, even all-natural ones. Studies show that the all-too-familiar gas, bloating, and gross GI issues so many athletes experience might be caused by the fructose found in their sports drinks, bars, and gels.","Under normal circumstances, fructose is absorbed through the gut wall and transported to the liver for processing. Sometimes a particular protein needed for this normal digestion is missing, and fructose sugars end up in the large intestine instead.","Once in the large intestine, gut bacteria ferment the fructose and you know what happens next: gas with bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and the urgency to rush to a bathroom.","Some degree of fructose malabsorption may be present in as much as 30-40% of athletes. When you consider that sports foods and drinks often use fructose as a carbohydrate source, they could potentially be to blame for some of the GI distress that frustrates so many athletes.","Fructose malabsorption can be made worse by a variety of factors.

Vic Marks,Thu 5 Jul 2018 13.05 EDT First published on Thu 5 Jul 2018 13.00 EDT,"After the kindergarten clash with the Aussies there is something a little spicier to savour as the white-ball section of the summer continues against India. There were a few animated exchanges between the players in the first T20 match at Old Trafford, something which was conspicuously absent when England were playing Australia. More pertinently, England were confronted with much stronger opposition and were duly thrashed by eight wickets.",David Willey was in the centre of a little contretemps with Bhuvneshwar Kumar in Manchester on Tuesday and like his father he is not shy about having an argument if necessary – although my recollection is that it was more the size of his forearms than the fierceness of his tongue that made Peter Willey a figure capable of intimidating the odd opponent or colleague.,Young David confirmed: “I don’t mind a bit of confrontation. I have had my fair share of it in the past. If it comes my way I am quite happy to get involved. But we are advised to play cricket and leave those antics to other people.”,"Then there was some shrugging of the substantial Willey shoulders. “They have a few fiery characters and that is part and parcel of cricket. It was something and nothing [at Old Trafford]. I think with all the microphones and cameras, people get a bit giddy about this sort of thing.”","On Friday evening in Cardiff, where England play the second T20 international, there will not be a football match to raise the spirits after a defeat. To prevail England must combat the left-arm wrist spin rather better than they did in Manchester, where Kuldeep Yadav took five for 24. It was a good time for England to succumb ineptly since most of the nation was absorbed in a different contest at the time.","As a consequence of that batting performance, Merlyn was wheeled out into the nets behind the stands at Sophia Gardens. Merlyn is England’s best spin bowler. Unfortunately it is a machine, a box on stilts with an aperture at the front out of which the ball appears with preordained spin imparted. Merlyn’s predecessor (also called Merlyn) was famously used by England in 2005 to combat Shane Warne. In fact, Warne took 40 wickets in that series, which may explain why Merlyn did not receive an OBE.","On Thursday Jos Buttler, Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan had a bat against Merlyn while Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow, both dismissed first ball by Yadav at Old Trafford, preferred facing conventional bowlers – with arms – in the nets on the outfield. Sensibly, the batsmen are allowed to make their own decisions about how they prepare for Friday’s challenge.","The pitch in Cardiff is unlikely to offer as much turn as at Old Trafford and the straight boundaries are short, the square one long. So it is best to hit the spinners straight, but the drive becomes a trickier shot than the sweep when the batsmen do not know which way the ball is going to bounce. Hence the need to try to get to grips with the likes of Kuldeep and the leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal.","England, of course, do not want to appear alarmed by the suggestion that they are frail against mystery spin. Willey was quick to point out: “I think our averages and stats against spin are unbelievable, so it was just one of those days [at Old Trafford]. Someone took a few wickets. Our lads will go away and think about their particular approach to it and we’ll come back and have full confidence in all the guys. Yes, it cost us in that last game but we don’t dwell upon things like that.”","England expect to play the same team as at Old Trafford with the strong possibility that Ben Stokes will return to the side for Sunday’s game in Bristol, which puts the onus upon Alex Hales, in particular, to make a significant contribution here. Unless they are in experimental mode, India will surely play the same team as well.","England (possible): EJG Morgan (Captain), JJ Roy, JC Buttler (wkt), AD Hales, JE Root, JM Bairstow, MM Ali, DJ Willey, AU Rashid, CJ Jordan, LE Plunkett India (possible): V Kohli (Captain), R Sharma, S Dhawan, KL Rahul, S Raina, MS Dhoni (wkt), H Pandya, B Kumar, K Yadav, U Yadav, Y Chahal Umpires: T Robinson and M Gough Third umpire: A Wharf Match referee: D Boon (Aus)","Probable teams England JJ Roy, JC Buttler (wkt), AD Hales, EJG Morgan (capt), JM Bairstow, JE Root, MM Ali, DJ Willey, CJ Jordan, LE Plunkett, AU Rashid.

Looking to prove his fitness following a hamstring tear, Stokes batted through 20 overs for a 68-ball 90 not out in a 44-run defeat at Headingley. Stokes was unable to bowl against a home side who amassed 200 for three thanks to 92 not out from Adam Lyth and an unbeaten 53 from Jonny Tattersall, the pair sharing an unbroken 110-run stand in 8.5 overs."

Already assured a legendary place in the exotic auto market, the brand new $1.3 million dollar Bugatti Veyron will come with a similarly impressive monthly price tag of approximately $23,595 plus taxes for those discriminating few lucky enough to experience the pinnacle of automotive luxury and technological achievement.","The Bugatti Veyron boasts the pedigree of automotive icon and legendary coachbuilder Etorre Bugatti, who founded his automobile company in 1908. Now approaching nearly a century of existence, Bugatti Automobiles has instilled supreme power into their latest creation, the 16-cylinder Veyron. The formidable engine, wrapped in a sensuously styled curvaceous body, enables the supercar to produce a jaw-dropping 1001-horsepower and a top speed that dwarfs any exotic car on the road, maxing out at an ethereal 255 mph top speed.","“The Bugatti Veyron is undoubtedly the most exotic of all supercars, but amazingly, the power of the car is very controlled. The Veyron has performance, technology, and a great look that makes everyone around the car ache for a chance to experience it,” says Steven Posner, President of Putnam Leasing. “And this is the exact reason why the Veyron is our top car for 2007 to lease. Amazingly, a lot of serious collectors still don’t know our company gives them the chance to get into a dream car like the Veyron.”","Although the wildly popular Bugatti Veyron tops Putnam Leasing’s prestigious list of the latest high-performance exotics and luxury cars the company offers monthly leasing programs on, nearly any exotic or luxury car is eligible. Fabled names in automotive elegance and luxury such as Bentley and Rolls-Royce as well as sizzling new exotics such as the red hot Ferrari F430 and outrageous Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder are also available. Virtually any car in the world can qualify for Putnam’s standard monthly leasing programs tailored towards catering to serious collectors looking to experience the ultimate in automotive excellence.","Many prospective customers interested in getting into a supercar are unaware that by using Putnam, they can literally finance just about any car, no matter the price. Even vehicles topping the million-dollar mark with their pre-sale estimates are available for lease. Now, fine autos of this caliber are available with convenient and cost-effective monthly payments, enabling serious auto collectors, celebrities, VIP buyers and athletes to get in the car of their dreams or expand their existing collections.","As is standard with all leases, monthly prices are subject to change based on down payment options. Serious collectors can call Putnam Leasing at any time to discuss leasing the Bugatti Veyron, as well as any other vehicle, and the various price options. Figures will be quoted based on credit approval by lender’s primary financial institution.","Just like more conventional auto leasing programs, Putnam offers amazing exotics and fine luxury cars on a monthly payment basis, giving buyers alternative lease plans with distinct advantages over traditional means of financing. From financial incentives and flexibility, to tax savings and deductibility, Putnam has been offering competitive leasing programs to a discriminating list of auto aficionados, celebrities and VIPs.","Putnam Leasing, established in 1983 and headquartered in Greenwich, Conn., is one of the longest-running and experienced companies in the United States to lease exotic and classic cars. With regional offices across the country, Putnam services more than 750 dealers throughout the U.S. and will customize a lease on luxury, exotic, and collector cars for any vehicle, regardless of brand.

Fri Dec 14 2:40pm ETBy STEVEN WINEAP Sports Writer,"MIAMI (AP) A person familiar with the move says the NFL has fined umpire Roy Ellison $9,300 and reinstated him from administrative leave after his dispute in Miami with Buffalo Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes.",The person confirmed the fine to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because the league hadn't commented. The fine is the amount of one game check for Ellison.,"TV video showed Hughes confronting Ellison in the tunnel near the locker room after the Dolphins' win over the Bills on Dec. 2 and accusing the official of using a derogatory term. Hughes waved his index finger and shouted, ''I'll catch you! I'll catch you, guaranteed!'' before being pulled away by a teammate.",Ellison was placed on administrative leave last week.,"San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle said he suffered ""fractured cartilage"" in his ribs early in the game against the Raiders last year but played through it. San Fran played Oakland on Nov. 1, so that means Kittle played around half the season after suffering that injury. The second-year professional had a truly breakout season, catching 88 passes for 1,377 yards and five touchdowns for the Niners. With quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo back healthy in 2019, the sky is the limit for Kittle. He'll likely be the third tight end off the board behind Travis Kelce and Zach Ertz in fantasy.",From RotoBaller,"Dallas Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said that the team will pick up running back Ezekiel Elliott's fifth-year option. The 23-year-old has two 1,000-yard seasons in his three years in the NFL and ran 304 times for 1,434 yards and six touchdowns in his 15 games last year. He also caught a career-high 77 passes for an additional 567 yards and three scores. Elliott is one of the premier running backs in the NFL and should continue to be a high first-round pick in fantasy drafts this fall.",From RotoBaller,"Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera said that quarterback Cam Newton (shoulder) is getting close to throwing again. There remains no timetable for Newton to return to action, however. It's the second straight offseason that Newton has had shoulder surgery. The 29-year-old remains one of the best dual-threat QBs in the league, but his shoulder woes have really capped his fantasy ceiling the last two seasons. His arm was extremely compromised late last year and he was unable to make a lot of the necessary throws. Newton finished with 3,395 yards, 24 touchdowns and 13 interceptions while also rushing 101 times for 488 yards and four more scores. If his shoulder bounces back nicely in training camp, owners should feel comfortable taking him as their QB1.",From RotoBaller,"The Miami Dolphins are not currently engaged in contract-extension talks with running back Kenyan Drake, according to a league source. The 25-year-old was underutilized by the last coaching staff, but he should be a part of the team's future as they rebuild. However, the talented back has a chance to be more effective under new offensive coordinator Chad O'Shea. Over his first three years in the NFL, Drake has averaged a healthy 4.7 yards per carry. Expect his total touches to go up in 2019, which will make Drake a potential excellent value pick in fantasy drafts.",From RotoBaller,"Miami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said safety Reshad Jones will remain with the team and said that Jones also does not want to be traded. Jones isn't with the team during voluntary workouts this week, but it sounds like the Dolphins have him in their plans for 2019. The 31-year-old had 72 tackles and three interceptions (one touchdown) in 14 games for the Dolphins in 2018.",From RotoBaller,"The Green Bay Packers claimed kicker Sam Ficken off waivers from the Seahawks on Monday, according to a source. The 26-year-old has gone three of six on field-goal tries and has made 14 of his 15 extra points in four games for the Rams over the last two years. He'll be depth behind Mason Crosby, who struggled mightily for a stretch in 2018.","Tampa Bay Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said running back Ronald Jones II has impressed the coaches the most this spring. The second-round pick was a disaster in his rookie season, playing in just nine games and rushing 23 times for just 44 yards (1.9 yards per rush) and one touchdown. Jones should have a bigger role in the backfield alongside Peyton Barber in 2019 with Jacquizz Rodgers no longer in the picture, but fantasy owners in redraft leagues will likely want to see it before they believe it.","Indianapolis Colts linebacker Darius Leonard weighed 234 pounds when he was drafted last April. The All-Pro was down to around 217 pounds in the final few games of the season but is now at 221 pounds and is hoping to keep his weight below the 225 mark as he enters his sophomore season. ""Im not a typical linebacker,"" Leonard, who also became a new father this offseason, says of why he wants to weigh far less than most linebackers. ""Im more of a speed guy, very athletic so if Im going to play in space, Im going to need to move."" The Defensive Player of the Year had a league-best 163 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, seven sacks, eight passes defensed, four forced fumbles and two interceptions. He has a chance to be a special player and will surely be one of the first few linebackers selected in IDP leagues.",From RotoBaller,Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Xavier Grimble signed his restricted free-agent tender offer on Tuesday. Grimble played in all 16 games last year and 44 of his 48 games with the team in the last three years. He has 22 catches for 236 yards and three touchdowns in his career and is mainly a blocking tight end behind pass-catcher Vance McDonald in Pittsburgh. You don't need to know his name in fantasy.,From RotoBaller,Free-agent running back T.J. Yeldon visited with the Buffalo Bills on Tuesday. Yeldon's best year came in his rookie season with Jacksonville back in 2015 when he ran 182 times for 740 yards and two touchdowns. He's scored just six times in his four-year career and would just be running back depth in Buffalo behind LeSean McCoy and the ageless Frank Gore.,From RotoBaller,"Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray no longer plans on visiting with the Washington Redskins this week, according to a source with knowledge of the scheduled visit. This could be nothing, but it could also be further evidence that Murray is expected to be selected by the Cardinals with the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft. There are questions about Murray's size and how it'll translate to the NFL, but there are no questions about his all-around athleticism. It would be a lot of fun to watch him run head coach Kliff Kingsbury's Air Raid offense in Arizona in 2019.",From RotoBaller,"Philadelphia Eagles running back Corey Clement (knee) said that he expects to be ready for Week 1 in 2019. He also said that his 2018 injury wasn't related to his ACL. The 24-year-old ran the ball 68 times for 259 yards and two touchdowns in his 11 games last season. With the Eagles adding Jordan Howard to an already crowded backfield, it might be difficult for Clement to return fantasy-relevant numbers in 2019, even if he starts the season at full health.",From RotoBaller,"Seattle Seahawks wide receiver David Moore signed his restricted free-agent tender offer on Tuesday. Moore emerged in his rookie season to catch 26 passes for 445 yards (17.1 yards per catch) and five touchdowns in a full season. He's third on the depth chart behind Doug Baldwin and Tyler Lockett, but Moore could take the next step in his sophomore campaign. However, he'll likely still be hit or miss for fantasy owners as a deep threat in an offense that ran the ball more than any other team in 2018.",From RotoBaller,"Indianapolis Colts LB Darius Leonard weighs 221 pounds at the moment and intends to keep his weight below 225 in order to take advantage of his athleticism. 'I'm not a typical linebacker. I'm more of a speed guy, very athletic so if I'm going to play in space, I'm going to need to move. ... I played all my life at 215, 220 and was never over 225. And last year I was injured a lot, that was when I was pretty heavy, so I want to stay down. Hopefully, I can cut some of that down,' Leonard told Kevin Bowen of 1070 The Fan.","Cincinnati Bengals WR John Ross will get a clean slate to prove himself under new head coach Zac Taylor, who called Ross 'electric' during his college days.","Fantasy Spin: Ross has battled injuries for most of his two seasons in the NFL, although he was available much more often in 2018. On one hand, it speaks to his playmaking ability that he turned 21 catches into seven touchdowns last season. On the other hand, he only corralled 36.2 percent of his 58 targets, which is an abysmal catch rate at any competitive level. There's still a chance he could experience a post-hype breakout, but fantasy owners would be wise to play the wait-and-see game at this point with him.","Philadelphia Eagles RB Corey Clement (knee) has no timetable for when he will be able to practice, but he is confident he will be ready for Week 1 of the 2019 regular season.","Restricted free-agent TE Xavier Grimble signed a one-year contract worth $2.025 million with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday, April 16.","Free-agent RB Rod Smith (Cowboys) visited with the Cincinnati Bengals recently, according to ESPN's Field Yates.","Exclusive rights free-agent WR David Moore signed a one-year contract worth $645,000 with the Seattle Seahawks on Tuesday, April 16.","Free-agent RB| T.J.

Online Basketball Drills,"Basketball Drills, Plays and Coaching Tips",I often use these [tag]basketball dribbling drills[/tag] to work with my children to focus on fitness and bi-lateral movement.,"The first drill I really like to use is “chair dribbling”. It is easy to set up and can be changed a hundred different ways. Essentially take a couple of chairs and place them inside the three point line (generally at the 4 o’clock, 6 o’clock, or 8 o’clock range if the basket was 12) creating an obstacle course on the way to a lay up. The kids can use any series of moves, fakes or just a controlled dribble around the inanimate objects on their way to the basket. I add chairs and or compress space to increase difficulty and encourage creative thinking (big in my overall goals).",Another drill is a warm-up that I call Ten in a Row. The player dribbles from one end and shoots one shot then dribbles to the other and shoots one shot. The drill continues for about four minutes or until the player(s) have made ten in a row.,Most players shoot layups but throughout the season the players will challenge themselves to get better and will use different styles of dribbling and will shoot a variety of shots.,"Got a [tag]basketball[/tag] coaching tip, drill, or idea you’d like to share with our community?

And don’t forget to read my latest article on kids basketball drills.",Jonathan Sparco says,"August 3, 2011 at 3:23 am","This is a good technique in teaching not just kids, but adults as well.

The third generation of the legendary Cooper tuning family will make his racing debut in the MINI CHALLENGE this season as Charlie Cooper confirms a deal to join Excelr8 Motorsport for this year’s Cooper Pro Championship.,"Charlie, 37, is the grandson of MINI tuning legend John Cooper, who designed and built the sporting versions of Alec Issigonis’s original iconic design.","The original MINI Cooper took world motorsport by storm, and the machines are still notching up race and rally wins around the globe. Perhaps its most notable achievement was victory on the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally against vastly more powerful machinery.","The Cooper legacy has continued through the John Cooper Works [JCW] badging of the hottest MINI machinery, with John Cooper’s son Michael heavily involved in the launch of the original MINI CHALLENGE at the turn of the century.","Charlie will this year act as a brand ambassador for MINI, and will be taking his first steps into the sport in a car that bears his family name.","“I’m really excited to get going because motorsport strangely isn’t something I ever thought I’d get to do,” said Charlie. “I did some karting when I was younger but spent much of my youth chasing a professional rugby career before injury ended that. To now have the chance to go racing is like a dream.","“I’m well aware of our family history and the amazing things my grandfather achieved, and to see what the family name has gone on to with the road cars and the MINI CHALLENGE is just amazing. It’s going to be a very proud moment for me getting to experience the sporting side.","“I’ve tested the car a few times and it’s great fun, but racing will be a big learning curve for me. I’ve done trackdays before but actual racing will no doubt be a real challenge. Getting my head around the slick tyres used in Cooper Pro will be a test as that’s totally new to me, but hopefully I can develop as a driver quickly and be competitive from the start.”","Charlie’s season is due to culminate in an outing in the top-flight JCW Championship at this year’s Donington Park season finale. “To race the JCW will be another big step up again,” he says. “Those cars are in a whole new league of performance. I’ll be learning as much as I can in the Coopers and hopefully it will stand me in good stead for the JCWs and I won’t make a fool of myself!”","Charlie and his father Michael now run the Cooper Bike Company in London, which was originally a sideline division of the Cooper Car Company.","Site by StuLane Motorsport Websites | Site and content copyright © 2019 MINICHALLENGE | Privacy PolicyThe MINI CHALLENGE Championship is organised and promoted by Total Track Limited Registered in England and Wales No 05237815.Registered at 19-20 Bourne Court, Woodford Green, Essex, IG8 8HD"

"In the great tradition of managerial tirades, Cincinnati skipper Bryan Price went red on the media on Monday. Thankfully, there’s a lot more where that came from",David Lengel,Wed 22 Apr 2015 05.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 17 May 2017 10.29 EDT,"There’s no particular order to this compendium, but since it’s Cincinnati Reds manager Bryan Price who brought us pennies from heaven with his Monday march on the Reds’ media, he’s in the top slot. If you’re keeping score at home, Price unleashed some 77 of these before their game in Milwaukee:",****.,"Since I am fluent in asterisk I can confirm reports that they were indeed fucks, and that the sheer volume and speed in which they were uttered by Price is believed to be a southern Ohio record.","So yes, the guy was in a bad mood, perturbed because the Cincinnati Enquirer writer (with a phenomenal Civil War-appropriate name) C Trent Rosecrans, reported that catcher Devin Mesoraco was not with the team after their 2-1 loss to the Cardinals on Sudnay, information the manager would’ve preferred to keep under wraps.","I mean, this transcript is legendary #BryanPrice #Reds http://t.co/vULWsPBnzh pic.twitter.com/xwopSbA22P","I’m going to put on my amateur psychologist cap for a moment and say that he may have also been experiencing a degree of anxiety because the team had dropped seven of eight games, and that anger displacement may have been a factor here.","Regardless, let’s put this in perspective and give the man some credit where it’s due: as mad as he was, Price was smart enough to wait for the television cameras to go away before letting loose, keeping him well out of Hal McRae territory (see below). Sadly, his superior rant management skills mean all that we’re left with is the transcript, and that’s just not good enough.",Just kidding! Prayers answered.,Now there’s a soundtrack for what is setting up to be a disaster of a season.,"To this writer, it’s the grandaddy of all in-office tirades, a gift to be passed down from generation to generation.","Your first thought is ‘This is what those Kansas City Royals could do to a man’, but this happened in April 1993, and actually, they weren’t awful that season, finishing above .500 and in third place in the old American League West. Still, their strongest throw of the season must have been that phone flying across the skippers office, and after an impressive 360-degree spin to boot! If you’re wondering if heavy objects being propelled across a small managers office is dangerous, well, yes it is. Reporter Alan Askew, who didn’t even ask that “stupid question” suffered a 1.5in cut on his right cheek and had blurry vision for several hours. And didn’t sue! Who says Americans are obsessed with litigation?","True story: I was once interviewing the ex-Dodgers manager about the best baseball movies and he told me that he was offended by the film Major League because of all the cursing that was included. It was an interesting take coming from Lasorda, who has provided two of the most amusing, profanity-laced tirades we’ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Part one is Lasorda responding to the question “What’s your opinion of [Dave] Kingman’s performance?” Kingman, also known as Kong, who basically either struck out or hit a home run for the duration of his colorful 16-year career, had connected for three home runs in June 1976 at Dodger Stadium for the New York Mets, which was all Tommy needed to provide us endless YouTube fun.","In June 1982, Dodgers reliever Tom Niedenfuer plunked Joe Lefebvre after the previous San Diego Padres batter, Broderick Perkins, took him deep. Kurt Bevacqua believed it was on purpose and so did Major League Baseball, who fined the hurler $500. Bevacqua said:","They ought to fine that fat little Italian, too. He ordered it.","That set Tommy off on a tirade for all-time, one that included the now famous line:","I have never ever since I’ve managed ever told a pitcher to throw at anybody, nor will I ever. And if I ever did, I certainly wouldn’t make him throw at a fucking .130 hitter like Lefebvre or fucking Bevacqua, who couldn’t hit water if he fell out of a fucking boat ...","Somewhat amazingly, Lasorda said nothing about the “Italian” slur, which really makes you wonder if it really was OK to just break out and say racist/ethnically insensitive stuff back then.","For many, Lee Elia’s rant is the unchallenged crown jewel of managerial rants, and with good reason. It addresses a legitimate question, one many sports fans have often wondered: Why aren’t fans at Wrigley Field afternoon games at work? Elia and the Cubs were booed during a one-run loss in April 1983, and the skipper provided the answer, in a timeless, crystal clear colorful way.","The Cubs never got “hotter than shit” as Elia had hoped and he didn’t make it through the season, fired with 39 games to go as the Cubs finished fifth in the NL East.","OK, I know this happened on the field, but there’s just no way it can be left out. Earl Weaver won four pennants and one World Series title with the Baltimore Orioles, not to mention some 1,480 games over 17 years in Baltimore. He died in 2013, but left behind a wonderful baseball legacy, one that includes this gem of a fight between himself and umpire Bill Haller back in 1980.","It’s a miracle that Haller was mic’d up for a documentary on umpires, capturing the scrap that occurred after he called a balk on O’s pitcher Mike Flanagan. If only we had audio for the other 90 times he was ejected ..."
Boston Sports Media Watch,"All seem in agreement that last night’s Celtics win was ugly. They act like that was a bad thing. Style points seem to count for a lot in Boston. Not only do the teams have to win, they need to look good doing it. It’s the case for the Patriots, you see it here for the Celtics, and it certainly applies to the Red Sox as well. Shira Springer, Mark Murphy and Robert Lee each feature the word “ugly” prominently in their game stories. Peter May injects a dose of reality by noting that the Celtics are getting the job done. He adds that their 11-5 record is even more impressive considering they’ve been going with 11 players, only 8 of whom play regularly, and that Walker and Pierce have struggled at times during this opening stretch. Gus Martins has a Kedrick Brown update, and he also submits a short story on Antoine Walker’s backbreaking three pointer. Michael Gee was bored stiff last night. He attempts to inject the same feeling into his readers. Brown is the subject of Lee’s notebook in the projo, while Springer’s notebook looks at the absence of Baron Davis from the Hornets lineup last night. Murphy’s notebook contains a number of items concerning the C’s.","Nick Cafardo has numerous quotes from an unnamed “NFC personnel man”, who touts and lauds the Dolphins after their performance yesterday. The personnel guy says: “if you’re asking me which is the better team I’d have to say the Dolphins. I think they disproved the theory they can’t play in cold weather.” He goes on to add that: ”I’d be utterly shocked if the Dolphins don’t hold on to win the division and then go far into this thing…I just think they (Patriots) have a tough road ahead if they’re going to overtake the Dolphins the next four games.” Anyone tell this guy that the Patriots now do not need to “overtake” the Dolphins? Michael Smith reports on Drew Bledsoe’s big day against the Dolphins. Dennis and Callahan on WEEI this morning still think that Miami is the team to beat as they have the running game and their defense is much improved. Yesterday’s game was an aberration caused by the conditions, they insist. They’re terrified of the Dolphins. Michael Felger has the Patriots cheering for Drew yesterday, and getting ready to beat him this Sunday. The Bills coaches are confident heading into this matchup, according to the last paragraph. Felger’s notebook looks at Ted Johnson’s increased role. Yesterday Tom Curran had an interesting column on the varied meaning of boos.",You can read summaries of all Theo Epstein’s Sunday Night appearances from last night below. The Epstein hiring has also created another phenomena…that of the “Theo Epstein career crisis” I’ve composed a short article on that topic.,You know Dennis and Callahan are going to love this snippet from Peter King in his Monday Morning Quarterback column:,"“When Charlie Weis lay comatose in a hospital bed in Boston last summer, the victim of a stomach-stapling surgery gone horribly wrong, wife Maura had a Catholic priest perform last rites twice on him. (The Weises are devout Catholics. Charlie went to Notre Dame.) When the archdiocese of Boston heard about Weis’ plight, it offered to send Cardinal Bernard Law to Weis’ bedside to pray for him. Law was, and still is, in the middle of the priest sex-abuse scandal, and has been accused of being too lenient with repeat offenders. Maura sent a message to the archdiocese that said, in effect: Thanks but no thanks. Keep the most influential Catholic man in New England away from my husband.”",FSNE has Celtics/Magic at 7:00. ABC has Jets/Raiders on Monday Night Football. ESPN2 has a college basketball doubleheader with Marquette/Notre Dame at 7:00 and Iowa/Florida State at 9:00,Automattician.

"Today we’re going to talk about the tennis serve grip. It’s one of the very first things you’ll need to learn if you want to hit a proper tennis serve and it’s something you can practice before you even step onto a court. In this article, we’ll cover:",Once you feel comfortable with your grip you should check out our article on forming the correct serve stance.,"If you’re new to tennis you might be surprised to learn that there is a specialized grip for the tennis serve. It’s called the continental grip, but before we get into the details let’s start by talking about why this is the best grip for your serve and the benefits of learning to use it.There are four main benefits for learning the continental grip:",There are four main benefits for learning the continental grip:,"If you’re like most beginners you may have started with some version of a forehand grip, which positions the face of the racquet and your strings towards the net when you hold it out in front of you as shown in the following picture. To be clear, this grip is incorrect for your serve.","However, the truth is, without an understanding of the proper technique and mechanics necessary to hit an effective tennis serve this grip is pretty logical.","The ball needs to travel forward, so you position the face of your racquet forward too. This way when you hit the tennis ball it moves towards the net and into the service box.",The challenge is that a forehand grip severely limits your ability to progress your serve and get better over time because you cannot achieve the benefits mentioned above.,"Recognizing this, let’s jump into the proper technique for holding your continental tennis serve grip.Tennis Serve Grip Technique",The technique for your tennis serve grip really boils down to how you need to hold your tennis racquet to form the continental grip. There are a few different ways you can approach forming the continental grip – let’s take a look at each.,One of the easiest ways to learn how to form the continental grip is to hold the racquet out in front of you and simply reach out and shake hands with the tennis racquet.,"To do this, hold your tennis racquet out in front of you with the edge of the racquet frame pointed down towards the court, i.e. perpendicular to the ground, and the strings facing to the side. When you go to shake hands with the racquet your grip should be very close to holding a continental grip.",Here’s a video that shows you how to “shake hands with your racquet.”,This easy method is great for beginners and kids as it helps provide them with a simple reference to remember the grip. After showing a group of kids how to hold this grip you can usually just shout out “shake hands with your racquet” and they’ll all be able to easily find the grip.,Another reference often used is to hold your racquet like a hammer as if you were going to use the side of the racquet to hammer in a nail.,"Similar to the shake hands with your racquet, this simple method should provide you with an easy to remember technique to hold your continental serve grip.","The most exact way to find your tennis serve grip is to use the bevels of the handle, which you may not have even noticed were there.","If you take a look at the handle of your tennis racquet you’ll notice it is an octagon with eight sides or bevels, just like a stop sign.",To find the correct grip we can simply label or number each bevel of your handle. With the racquet out in front of you and the side of the racquet frame pointing down towards the court we’ll label the very top bevel as #1 and then each subsequent bevel moving counterclockwise all the way around to #8.,If you’re right handed you’ll want to open your hand and place the inside of your index fingers knuckle against the #2 bevel or the #8 bevel if you’re left handed and then grip the racquet.,Here’s another video to show you exactly what I mean.,Once you do this you should be holding a continental grip.,"When you first begin to use a continental grip for your serve it’s likely going to feel a bit awkward and will take some time to get used to. To help, here are some of our favorite tips for your serve grip.","When you first begin to use a continental grip for your serve it’s likely going to feel a bit awkward and will take some time to get used to. To help, here are some of our favorite tips for your serve grip.","Often times when serving, players will tightly grip their racquet handle. This may be because they’re worried the racquet is going to fall out of their hand when they serve or perhaps that a firm grip will allow them to hit harder.","However, when it comes to tennis, tension is a player’s worst enemy because it prevents your body from remaining fluid and flexible, which is where much of your power and control comes from.","So, rather than tightly holding your serve grip or squeezing your racquet handle too hard, simply relax your hand so the racquet handle is secure yet loose enough to allow your wrist and arm to move freely.",Another tip that can be useful for players learning the continental serve grip is to spread your fingers slightly.,"When most players first grip their racquet for their serve they have a tendency to crowd their fingers, which can make it harder to control their racquet frame.","If you allow your fingers to spread out a little bit when gripping your racquet you should notice that you have more control and can, therefore, more easily maneuver your racquet head. This is particularly helpful when changing the angle or direction of your racquet for the different types of tennis serves including flat, slice, topspin and kick.","Playing on the tip above to spread your fingers, it can also be helpful to lift your index finger so that it reaches further up the racquet handle.","Again, similar to spreading your fingers, extending your index finger up the handle of your tennis racquet will provide you with added stability and control of your tennis racquet through your service motion.","There’s no need to over exaggerate here, but do what feels comfortable.","At first, you may find it challenging to move quickly from your continental grip to your groundstroke grips and in particular your forehand grip. If you’re having that problem my biggest tip for you is to simply stick with it.","Yes, it does take some time to get comfortable with switching your grip. However, it will pay off in the long run and before you know it switching grips will be second nature – you won’t even have to think about it.","Furthermore, your continental service grip is the same grip you should be using for your volleys and overheads.","This is incredibly important when you learn to serve and volley because you’ll be approaching the net after you serve, which means your opponent’s return is going to reach you quickly and you won’t have any time to adjust your grip.",Sometimes it can be helpful to see how other players are holding their racquet to get a better feel for the grip you should be using.,"In this section, we’ll take a look at the serve grips for Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Pete Sampras.",Photo Credit: Marianne Bevis,Photo Credit: WeAreTennis,Photo Credit: Mirasha,Photo Credit: Ben Lowe,Photo Credit: Adrien MANN,If you have questions about how to form your tennis serve grip or about anything we talked about in this article please feel free to post a comment in the section below. We’d love to hear from you!,Why join?,"Nicely done, very clear…even I can do this!","Hey, John! Thanks for the positive feedback. Glad to hear the article was clear and easy to follow.","~ All the best, Jon","Jon; I move my grip further left than continental when trying to get extra kick on the ball, as did Edberg. No doubt the flex in the wrist is increased with the proper grip. I never, when talking to players, talk about “power”. That word conveys tight muscles. Rather, one should stress racket head speed, just as a golf coach talks of club head speed. Relaxed and rhythmic is critical to good serving. My high school coach (ex U of Wisconsin) stress the relaxed body, arm and wrist. while serving, and turned out great servers, most of whom played university tennis. ,",I like this campaign.

Joliet Herald-News sports editor Steve Soucie brings more than two decades of Illinois high school football knowledge to Shaw Media. Follow him on Twitter @thesouc and check out his Week 8 state power rankings here. (Previous record and ranking in parentheses).,"25. Glenbard East (8-0, NR): One of the best turnaround seasons in recent memory as the Rams are sure to be a very high seed in whatever class they land in (7A or 8A). Up next: at Elgin Larkin.","24. Oak Park-River Forest (6-2, NR): Wins at Duchon Field (Glenbard West) are far and few between for visitors, but the Huskies earned the right to relish one there. Up next: vs. Lyons.","23. Bolingbrook (7-1, NR): The Raiders get another shot to show their best talent against a top-flight opponent. Up next: at No. 1 Lincoln-Way East.","22. Niles Notre Dame (7-1, NR): The Dons are another team squaring off with a team desperate to break into the playoff field, but Ty Gavin and crew won’t let that happen without a serious fight. Up next: vs. Joliet Catholic.","21. Rolling Meadows (8-0, 24): Really good teams find a way when they are challenged. The Mustangs certainly did that in a showdown victory over previously undefeated Hersey. Up next: at T.F. North.","20. IC Catholic (8-0, 20): Shouldn’t be much trouble running the regular-season table this week before it is welcomed into the Class 4A playoff fray for the first time. Up next: vs. Riverside-Brookfield.","19. Hillcrest (8-0, 22): The 5A field is right to fear the Hawks, who are proving to be an explosive team on both sides of the football. Up next: vs. Bremen.","18. Gurnee Warren (7-1, 25): Flying under the radar no more, win over Stevenson gives it a feather in its cap. The lone loss to Barrington in Week 1 seems like a long time ago. Up next: at Mundelein.","17. Willowbrook (8-0, 18): The Warriors face a team that is hoping to scare up an upset to earn a playoff bid, but odds are Willowbrook will complete the undefeated regular-season slate. Up next: at Downers Grove South.","16. Montini (8-0, 19): Didn’t know how good the defensive unit was because of soft early schedule, but the Broncos defense is proving to still be stout despite stiffer competition. Up next: vs. No. 2 Brother Rice.","15. East St. Louis (6-2, 17): No opponent has held the Flyers under 32 points all season. They have proven to be a nightmare for opposing defenses. Up next: at Alton.","14. Naperville Central (6-2, 17): Vaunted passing attack will get a severe challenge from Cary-Grove in a playoff-like matchup. Up next: at No. 11 Cary-Grove.","13. Phillips (7-2, 13): The only question is which side of the Class 6A bracket will have to deal with this revitalized crew, north or south? Up next: at Raby.","12. Richards (8-0, 11): The Bulldogs have being toying with their South Suburban foes in the regular season, postseason can’t get here fast enough for this team. Up next: vs. Eisenhower.","11. Cary-Grove (8-0, 12): Finally removed the Prairie Ridge stigma from its ledger, but the challenges don’t stop as a strong Naperville Central team will give the Trojans all they can handle. Up next: vs. No. 14 Naperville Central.","10. Homewood-Flossmoor (7-1, 10): Defense continues to stifle most opponents, holding a six-win Andrew team to just a field goal in Week 8. Up next: vs. Sandburg.","9. Oswego (8-0, 9): Southwest Prairie foes who have been outscored 339-50 this season are delighted the regular-season slate is coming to a close. Up next: at Plainfield South.","8. Nazareth (7-1, 8): The Roadrunners bounced back nicely in a comfortable win over Joliet Catholic. One loss moves their 7A seed down, but it doesn’t damper the enthusiasm that they are a title threat. Up next: vs. Marian Catholic.","7. Simeon (8-0, 7): I don’t think it matters whether the Wolverines end up in Class 7A or Class 8A, they are a threat in either classification to make serious noise. Up next: at Curie.","6. Mount Carmel (6-1, 6): Looks like an absolute wrecking ball right now and has allowed one touchdown since Week 3. Up next: vs. Fenwick.","5. Maine South (7-1, 5): Another year, another conference crown for the Hawks. It’s hard to be low-key in the top five, but it sure feels like it for Maine South right now. Up next: vs. Niles West.","4. Marist (7-1, 4): Offense continues to pile up the points, and the defense seems to be catching its stride. A frightening combination. Up next: at Benet.","3. Batavia (8-0, 3): Probably needed the test against St. Charles North, but also would have preferred the test come without so much stress. Up next: at Wheaton North.","2. Brother Rice (8-0, 2): Have absolutely cruised for the last two weeks in getting ready for one of two 8-0 vs. 8-0 games in the state this week. Up next: at No. 16 Montini.","1. Lincoln-Way East (8-0, 1): Griffins have allowed just 56 points all season and no one has come within 19 points of them all season. Up next: vs. No. 23 Bolingbrook."
"As you may have noticed we have transformed Scout into a data and stats driven service geared towards helping invested fans make the right decisions on a daily basis. This is our new Fantasy Scouting Report that we produce for each fantasy relevant player. We treat them like a stock and report their value in season long fantasy, the current fantasy week, and if applicable, on FanDuel and on DraftKings. We establish what is expected of the player based on fantasy ownership %, start %, and DFS Salary and see if our proprietary forecasting model projects a better or worse than expected performance. For complete recaps of the best and worst values for each market (season, weekly, daily), injury reports and team outlooks be sure to check out the new Scout.","If you are in a league that allows for substitutions during the week Devin Booker is a bad value the rest of the week. He has a market rank of #18 while his projection (rest of week 13) rank is #41. When compared to other guards in week 14, Louis Williams (107.1 FP), Kyle Lowry (105.3 FP), Mike Conley (133 FP), Stephen Curry (119.4 FP), and Jeff Teague (82.4 FP) are all projected for fewer points than Booker but are starting in more leagues. Starting in 67% of leagues he is expected to produce 80.6 fantasy points (WK 14). At his start percentage, he is expected to be the #29 guard of week 14. He is projected to be better than that (the #5 guard). His per game projected FP average is 36.4 which is better than his actual per game average (28.7).

We have picks on every game and line.,"There are 21 guards owned in 100% of leagues and Devin Booker is projected to be the #9 among them. His market rank among all guards is #18 but that rank is clearly impacted by the significant time he missed. Based on these projections, he is set to trend up. He is projected for 1445 fantasy points in 39 remaining games. Based on average FPs, he is even better with the #7 highest average. The market ranks Devin Booker behind McCollum and above Lowry but the projections rank Devin Booker over McCollum. Out of 7 major fantasy categories he ranks significantly lower in 5 categories than his overall fantasy point ranking and these are relative weaknesses. Scoring is his strength but he has areas he could improve on to become a more well-rounded fantasy guard.","Booker is not in the 1/11 DFS player pool, but one player who is in the Sportsline FanDuel optimal lineup is James Harden, and Joe Ingles is in the DraftKings optimal lineup.",© 2004-2019 CBS Interactive.

"The local community were saddened to learn of the death of well known sportsman William Ivan Craig, who passed away peacefully at Craigavon Area Hospital on January 3.","Ivan was the dearly loved husband of Helen and father of Jacob, Adam and Katie. He was born on August 29, 1966 to the late Lily and Morris Craig and was younger brother to Maurice and Shirley.","His school days were spent at Scarva Primary, Banbridge High and Banbridge Academy where he completed his A-Levels.","As a young man Ivan pursued a future career as a Quantity Surveyor with Desmond Chambers Builders in Banbridge, but after a short spell with John Sinton Ltd Tandragee, Ivan began what would turn out to be a 28-year career with the Prison Service. His work provided him with great fellowship and camaraderie during many challenging and dangerous times. It also provided Ivan with the opportunity to play lots of golf with the Prison Service Society and also as a member of Banbridge and Portadown Golf Clubs. He played off a 2 to 4 handicap for many years and enjoyed success in local competitions. However golf was only Ivan’s second sporting love as he was born into a bowling family. He started indoor bowls at four years of age and by seven was winning open competitions with his mother, father, brother and sister.","In 1984 Ivan was crowned Northern Ireland Bowling Association Singles Winner and was narrowly defeated in the All-Ireland Singles final at the tender age of 18. That same year he also won the Allum Cup for Indoor Singles, the Dundee Masters Singles, Under-25 Indoor Singles Long Mat, Shorts Triples and many other tournaments with his family.",Ivan was a founder member of Rathfriland Outdoor Bowling Club in 1982 and a proud team member as they made their way through various leagues to become Senior 1 winners. He had a spell with Dunbarton in Private Greens League One before retiring from the game for 11 years to concentrate on his golfing passion.,"He came out of retirement to play for Lisnagarvey in NIBA Senior 1, and in recent years he was honoured to be become their Captain and President. Just last October he was presented with their ‘Player of The Year’ trophy.","Along with his great friend Neil Mullholland, Ivan achieved many NIBA Championship victories and they were a formidable partnership in pairs, triples and rinks.","Ivan was a man who simply loved to play and watch sport of any type. His competitive nature and sense of humour will be sadly missed at bowls and golf, but nowhere more so than in the family home where his young family will miss him dearly.",Ivan had been battling illness for just 19 weeks but had never complained about his condition and his faith and spirits were always high. He took great pride and comfort from his family during this stressful time. They enjoyed short family holidays and nights at the movies as well as daily meals with his work mates and friends as Ivan amazed everyone at how he handled his terminal illness.,"His funeral, which was well attended, took place at Shankill Parish Church, Lurgan on Friday, January 5.","Church minister Rev Mark Harvey, alongside Ivan’s friend and golfing partner Rev William Orr, officiated at the service and graveside and their presence at the hospital and family home throughout Ivan’s illness was a great comfort to all.",Ivan was laid to rest in Tullylish Presbyterian burying ground.,"Donations in lieu of flowers are being sent to Malcomson’s Funeral Service, Robert Street, Lurgan to be passed on to Friends of the Cancer Centre.","The family have expressed their thanks to all those who cared for Ivan during his illness - the nurses at Craigavon Area Hospital, Belfast City Hospital Cancer Ward and the Macmillan Cancer Care staff - for their dedication and professionalism.",©2019 JPIMedia Ltd.

"Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, in response to a question from Roadshow, claimed that sports cars are still important despite sinking sales because “they are a testimony of technology and of the brand.” It’s a nice sentiment, but it rings hollow considering Nissan’s current lineup of outdated sports cars and terminated concept cars.",Here’s the quote from Roadshow’s article:,"While [Ghosn] doesn’t forecast robust sales ahead, he took pains to highlight the importance of such models “because they are flagships. They are a testimony of technology and of the brand.”","Part of that is due to the fact that “premium cars and sports cars probably represent 90 percent of the media coverage, even though they represent 10 percent of the sales of the industry,” said Ghosn.﻿","Ghosn was also quoted saying, “we’re going to continue to develop sports cars because it’s so important for the storytelling.”","When, though?","The now-ridiculously overpriced Nissan GT-R, the brand’s flagship, is nearly a decade old, with only an ugly concept car and rumors of hybridization lending any hope that it still has a future.",Advertisement,"The brand’s other sports car, the 370Z, is also now seven years old. That’s not an unusual life-cycle for a car, but considering Nissan recently reportedly killed the extremely popular retro, inexpensive, rear-drive IDx concept car last year, there doesn’t seem to be a replacement for the Z coming anytime soon.",The ongoing saga of the Nissan IDx is a sad one of dreams meeting reality. But now it might coming…,"Is the GT-R really enough to fill that “90 percent” of publicity Ghosn claims is crucial to Nissan’s brand image? It’s an icon, for sure. Many fan-favorite earlier generations are just beginning to pass the 25 year import ban here in the U.S., and the current generation’s low price at launch quickly made it a prominent “supercar” in the growing YouTube enthusiast culture. But the GT-R’s price has now moved a mind-numbing $100,000 higher than what it started at back in 2007.",Advertisement,"One has to wonder what, exactly, Nissan is thinking shelving an extremely popular inexpensive potential Z-replacement at the end of the current generations life-cycle, and what it’s planning to do with the increasingly-inflated GT-R.",Can Ghosn’s claimed “90 percent” of media coverage really float the brand based on one increasingly out-of-reach supercar? Perhaps it was the mellow reaction to the Toyota-Subaru sports car twins that killed the next Z car. Perhaps it’s just easier (and cheaper) for Nissan to push the GT-R to a higher pedestal and hope it carries the rest of the brand with it.,"Whatever it is, it’s just disappointing.","Staff Writer, Jalopnik"

Passports and Adventures,"In this instalment of my Best and Worst Holidays Series we hear about a lucky win from Katie of Mummys Diary, a holiday which turned out to be awesome.",,"Last year I had a lucky streak! I had entered a number of competitions and won some small prizes, I was over the moon! Now I rarely check my junk folder but this one day I decided to have a look, and thank goodness I did!","I found an email from a major coach company informing me that I had won the competition they had hosted a few months back. I vaguely remembered it but when I read the email I was in shock. Was this real? The email said congratulations you have won a pair of tickets and travel expenses paid to Sziget Festival. Ooh great I thought that’ll be a nice day out. I continued reading… the festival is held every year, in Budapest! If I read it once I must have read it a hundred times!","I was in work at the time that I found the email, and I was so excited I shouted out to all in the office that I had won! But I hadn’t replied! In my excitement I had phoned my husband and family and friends instead! I emailed them back straight away to confirm yes we would obviously accept the prize!","Finally it was confirmed we had definitely won. We were so excited the festival was on over 7 days! Could we leave the children for that length of time, would they understand that we hadn’t abandoned them? Luckily for us their grandparents are amazing and were more than happy to have them stay with them while we went. My husband and I have never had a holiday abroad together so we were very excited.","The day arrived when we were all packed and ready to leave. The prize didn’t include accommodation, but we could camp on the island that the festival was taking place on. We had a long discussion and decided that we would instead book a hotel. We realised we may never get the chance to visit Budapest again so we wanted to make the most of the time we had there and do some sightseeing along the way.","The journey over was by coach, I think it was around 25 hours travelling. It wasn’t so bad going over though as we stopped in different countries along the way which was amazing. When we arrived we headed straight to the hotel to unload our bags, we then took a walk down to the Danube river to stretch our achy legs and then retired to bed.",We had done a lot of research before we left and knew exactly what we wanted to do and see.,The main attractions we visited were;,"Fisherman’s Bastion. This is a viewing area set in a gothic Romanesque terraced area with fairy tale towers. It offers amazing panoramic views over Budapest and was well worth getting lost to find it! We even decided to treat ourselves to a fancy, if not a bit expensive, dinner overlooking the river, it was so relaxed and the food was great.",,"Hospital In The Rock is not really to my cup of tea, but my husband enjoys these things. It is a nuclear bunker museum with life like figures showing what it was like when it was open. The funiculars are a great way to travel upwards instead of walking up the steep hills. These were fun to ride and also offer great views of the chain bridge. Enjoying the views after a funicular ride Chain Bridge is a suspension bridge over the Danube river. It was the first bridge built that connected both sides Buda and Pest. Parliament Building, Budapest The festival itself was indeed a sight to see, there were so many unusual activities going on including a game show style dodgem course, as well as dancing and amazing food stalls. We danced the night away to Iggy Azalea and felt just like we were kids again. It was so freeing to feel free, just a couple of days away from reality to enjoy life again and to re-connect with one another, which as busy working parents is so important. It was definitely my best holiday. Budapest is such an amazing place to visit and I hope we do end up going back one day. The festival bar Wow, what a holiday. My hubby and I haven’t had even a night to ourselves since our son came along, so a whole week’s holiday sounds utterly heavenly. And we’d love to visit Budapest.

Home All The News Ozil agent destroys Arsenal ‘reserve’ Keown in 849-word rant,Date published: Thursday 10th May 2018 8:39,Mesut Ozil’s agent has absolutely destroyed former “Arsenal reserve” Martin Keown in an 849-word rant.,"At this stage of a news article, there would normally be some sort of preamble, some background. But just have Keown’s initial critique, and then enjoy the response from Ozil’s agent, Dr. Erkut Sogut.","“I think that Martin Keown feels that just because he used to play football, it gives him the right to attack the current generation of stars,” Sogut told Goal.","“Perhaps he just wants to remain relevant, or maybe it is due to jealousy?",“Is he envious about the money and exposure that current footballers have – I don’t know.,"“But to sit there and criticise, and criticise, and criticise, time and time again, it’s getting a bit boring, in all honesty.",“He was an Arsenal reserve so left for Everton and Aston Villa because he wasn’t good enough.,“He returned to Arsenal but was still a reserve – always in the shadow of Adams/Bould/Dixon/Winterburn and then Campbell/Toure/Lauren/Cole.,"“His behaviour towards [Ruud] Van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford brought shame on Arsenal, he will say it showed his passion when really it was bad sportsmanship.","“If Mesut, or any other player in this era were to act like that, they would bring great shame upon themselves and their club.","“In the 2004 Invincible season, Arsene Wenger let him play the last minute vs Leicester to qualify for a winner’s medal.",“Otherwise he would not be an Invincible because he didn’t play enough games. He wasn’t a real part of the team.,“Even Keown’s team-mate Ray Parlour said publicly he would have killed Wenger if he did not let him come on the pitch against Leicester.,"“This is again representative of the behaviour against Manchester United – he claims passion, whilst it is really aggression.”",Sogut then took aim at Keown’s short and ill-fated coaching career.,“He spent time helping coach the defenders at London Colney some time ago but then it stopped. Why would it stop if he was so good and knew so much about the game?” he said.,"“Was it that Arsene Wenger, the players and staff did not want him there?","“Since then, he has remained an outsider from the club – he has very little knowledge of the internal events at the club, and is in no position to comment with such confidence. Does he have access to medical records… no.","“He spent many years criticising Wenger. Then it is announced Wenger is leaving and Keown starts to say nice things about Wenger – and after the Burnley game he had the audacity to go on the pitch with the real, and loyal, legends like Robert Pires.","“He questions Mesut’s loyalty, but can’t stick behind his own arguments – how can his opinion be trusted or validated?","“On the same programme, even a former Tottenham player [Jermaine Jenas] said Mesut is not in the team to defend.",“Jenas said he watched Mesut for Real Madrid and Germany and he is in the team to create chances and assist the goals – why when he comes to Arsenal do people think he should completely change the style of play that has earned him so much success.,“This style of play has earned him more international success that most ever.,"“With 89 caps for Germany (in what some would say is a golden era for the national team), he has won the most prestigious trophy in football. Keown achieved very little in his 43 caps for England.","“Arsenal will finish the season having scored 54 league goals at the Emirates; their joint-highest tally of home goals in a Premier League campaign, along with 2004/05. So attack is no problem.",“The problem is defence. How is this the fault of Mesut? Have you looked at how Mesut’s statistics compare to other Arsenal players? Maybe you should do that because you speak badly of him.,"“Why is Mesut the only player Keown criticises? Yet similarly, he is loved by a strong majority of Arsenal fans across the world?","“When you are a small name compared to all the other football pundits on TV and radio like Thierry Henry, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, is it simply a coincidence that you decide to repeatedly criticise the biggest name in the team?",“This harks back to the aforementioned points about jealousy and remaining relevant.,“Did you criticise Mesut with so much passion at a time when the fans were in pain after losing to Atletico because you knew it would give the fans a scapegoat and make you look like a hero who cares the most about Arsenal? They sang your name in the stadium so you must be happy with that.,“You said that Mesut was not loyal and would run down his contract and leave the club. Good prediction – he signed a new contract.,"“Talking about loyalty and dedication, he has played throughout the season against medical advice. This has been kept hidden from the public, but when you’re attacked so viciously, it deserves a mention.","“We are responding to you not because your words hurt us but because they are wrong. You cannot break us as you cannot influence the fans and people at the club, all of whom love Mesut.","“Mesut wants to lead this club forward while you try to divide the club to keep yourself in the public eye and relevant with stupid, incorrect comments.",“You joke Mesut will have an ’emotional breakdown’. Do you think it is funny to joke about mental health?”,More from Planet Sport,QUIZ: Test your knowledge on the legendary Jack Nicklaus (Golf365).,"Time for Next Gen stars to take on Federer, Nadal in slams (Tennis365).",Cricket is great; we won’t save the game by telling everyone it isn’t (Cricket365).,QUIZ: Test your Spanish Grand Prix knowledge (PlanetF1).,,"Ten years on, what has happened to Arsenal's FA Youth Cup winners from 2009?

Request PDF brochure,"Originally unveiled in 1963 as the 901, the 911 – as it would be renamed upon production launch a year later – would quickly become the celebrated successor to Porsche’s first production car, the 356. With its new 2.0-litre engine and all-around independent suspension, the bigger, more powerful and more refined 911 was designed with Grand Touring in mind, going onto to become arguably the most successful sports car ever built, with continuous development to this day. This 1965 911 was a ‘pure build’ historic racing car, built specifically for historic racing by a low key but well-known car builder. With an impressive set of entries to its name and a fresh race engine, it is on the button and ready to go.",,Chassis number: 300915 (showing)Engine: 2.0-litre flat 6-cylinder Gearbox: 5-speed manual Mileage: n/a Colour: Light Ivory Interior: Black,Share on:,,"Retaining the familiar rear-engined, air-cooled ‘boxer’ configuration of its predecessor, the 911 acquired a new 1,991cc flat 6-cylinder power unit, producing 130hp at 6,200 rpm, alongside new four and five-speed manual transmission options, all-around disc brakes and 2+2 seating. Whilst development of the early road car forged ahead with the introduction of new models such as the high-performance S variant, the exclusive 911 R was also unveiled, a lightweight racing version with only 20 cars produced.

The car was then raced at the Goodwood Revival Meeting that year by well-known Porsche Club member Jeff Moyes. It should be pointed out that the car is not believed to have its original shell. The current owner campaigned the car extensively from 2010 to 2015. He competed in some major events such as Le Mans Classic (2014), the Goodwood Members Meeting (2015), the GT & Sports Car Cup (2010, 2011, 2013) and HSCC Guards Trophy (2010, 2011). The owner used both Steve Monk and Steve Winter for race support as well as Sportwagen for bodywork. There are two bills from Sportwagen on file, one in 2010 for what is described as ‘pitlane damage’ and one in 2015 to correct what is described as minor corrosion in the front scuttle and bonnet. The engine was rebuilt by well-known Porsche engine specialists as a full race engine in 2016 and has not been used in anger since. A rolling road test at the time showed a power output of 170bhp. The engine drives very nicely with a wide power band and would be perfect for use in a road racing event such as the Tour Auto.

It should be pointed out that the car is not believed to have its original shell.,"The current owner campaigned the car extensively from 2010 to 2015. He competed in some major events such as Le Mans Classic (2014), the Goodwood Members Meeting (2015), the GT & Sports Car Cup (2010, 2011, 2013) and HSCC Guards Trophy (2010, 2011).","The owner used both Steve Monk and Steve Winter for race support as well as Sportwagen for bodywork. There are two bills from Sportwagen on file, one in 2010 for what is described as ‘pitlane damage’ and one in 2015 to correct what is described as minor corrosion in the front scuttle and bonnet.",The engine was rebuilt by well-known Porsche engine specialists as a full race engine in 2016 and has not been used in anger since. A rolling road test at the time showed a power output of 170bhp. The engine drives very nicely with a wide power band and would be perfect for use in a road racing event such as the Tour Auto.,"At the end of 2018, the car was given 40 hours of preparation by Andy Prill for service as a Course Car at the popular Goodwood Revival Meeting, a task it completed with flying colours.",,"With the launch of Peter Auto’s new Europe-based 2 Litre Cup in association with Sports Purpose, the popularity of the pre-1966 Porsche 911 racing car has firmed considerably over the last 12 months, with racers of all backgrounds eager to be involved with the increasingly popular one-make series. 1966 is the obvious cut-off point for FIA Historic racing cars and also sits well with the end of the pre-911 S era of early, short wheelbase Porsche 911 development. Having contested at many of the most desirable historic racing meetings already, this smart car is ready for the second season of the 2 Litre Cup. It is a well-prepared and set-up car that could clearly compete consistently for top 10 results in this closely fought series.",

Running and weightlifting, and other sports that involve repetitive impact, expose children to a high risk for lumbar (lower back) injuries. Contact sports, such as soccer and football, expose the cervical spine, or neck, to injury. More than one-third of all high school football players sustain some type of injury. Soccer participants are easy candidates for mild to severe head traumas, neck injuries, cervical spine damage, headache, neck pain, dizziness, irritability, and insomnia. Heading the ball, the act of using the head to re-direct the soccer ball, has been linked with cervical injuries in children and adults.

"South African tennis player Kevin Anderson stunned many when he reach the Wimbledon final. As an added bonus, he also has a best-ever world ranking of No 5. Now, Anderson has said that he has no plans to retire.","The 32-year-old made waves at Wimbledon when he beat eight-time champion Roger Federer in the quarter-finals. His fame only grew in the semifinals after a record six-hour, 36 minute win over John Isner.","Sadly, his good fortune ended there as he lost in straight sets in the final to Novak Djokovic. Anderson slumped to his second loss in a major final. He had also lost in straight sets in last year’s US Open final to Spain’s Rafael Nadal.","Many would assume that Anderson’s hopes of winning a Grand Slam in future are all but gone. However, the South African does not seem to think so.","“For the first time in the Open era, all four men’s singles semi-finalists at Wimbledon were over 30 years of age. Potentially we are getting better with age. There are a lot of men playing great tennis well into their thirties. The whole dynamic has definitely changed,” Anderson said.","“A decade ago, players reaching the age of 30 were sort of coming to the end of their professional careers. The perspective has completely changed and you could say that 35 is the new 30. Federer is 36 and is playing his best tennis, and there is no reason I can’t still play my best tennis for years to come.”","But to remain competitive at his age, he stressed on staying fit for the next few years.","“Having the right outlook is important – people say that at this level (of professional competition) it’s mostly mental – but you have to take care of your body as well. It’s most important, especially as you get older. The work I do with my physiotherapist has been instrumental in keeping me healthy and it’s a big reason why I’m able to continue to improve my game. Which is why moving forward, my primary focus is on putting my body first, as I would like to stay fit and healthy.”",CAPTCHA Code *,,(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});,"(function() { var lkqdSettings = { pid: 252, sid: 976153, playerContainerId: '', playerId: '', playerWidth: 640, playerHeight: 400, execution: 'outstream', placement: 'slider', playInitiation: 'auto', volume: 100, trackImp: '', trackClick: '', custom1: '', custom2: '', custom3: '', pubMacros: '', dfp: false, gdpr: '', gdprcs: '', lkqdId: new Date().getTime().toString() + Math.round(Math.random()*1000000000).toString(), supplyContentVideo: { url: '', clickurl: '', play: 'post' } };</p> <p> var lkqdVPAID; var creativeData = ''; var environmentVars = { slot: document.getElementById(lkqdSettings.playerContainerId), videoSlot: document.getElementById(lkqdSettings.playerId), videoSlotCanAutoPlay: true, lkqdSettings: lkqdSettings };</p> <p> function onVPAIDLoad() { lkqdVPAID.subscribe(function() { lkqdVPAID.startAd(); }, 'AdLoaded'); }</p> <p> var vpaidFrame = document.createElement('iframe'); vpaidFrame.id = lkqdSettings.lkqdId; vpaidFrame.name = lkqdSettings.lkqdId; vpaidFrame.style.display = 'none'; var vpaidFrameLoaded = function() { vpaidFrame.contentWindow.addEventListener('lkqdFormatsLoad', function() { lkqdVPAID = vpaidFrame.contentWindow.getVPAIDAd(); onVPAIDLoad(); lkqdVPAID.handshakeVersion('2.0'); lkqdVPAID.initAd(lkqdSettings.playerWidth, lkqdSettings.playerHeight, 'normal', 600, creativeData, environmentVars); }); vpaidLoader = vpaidFrame.contentWindow.document.createElement('script'); vpaidLoader.setAttribute('async','async'); vpaidLoader.src = 'https://ad.lkqd.net/vpaid/formats.js'; vpaidFrame.contentWindow.document.body.appendChild(vpaidLoader); }; vpaidFrame.onload = vpaidFrameLoaded; vpaidFrame.onerror = vpaidFrameLoaded; document.documentElement.appendChild(vpaidFrame); })();",

Brushing aside a strong St Cyprian side and then the hosts 4-1 on the first morning of play helped to boost the confidence of the Bloemfontein side who went on to record win after win for the remainder of the tournament. Tuane van der Westhuizen in particular was impressive for Oranje as she worked herself in position and found the back of the net with habitual precision.","The surprise package at the tournament was St. Cyprians who bravely took on some of the big names and invariably came away with the victory. The tenacity of the Cape Town school which was borne out in how they held their collective nerve in their semi-final penalty shootout win over St.Mary’s Waverley, and they earned the right of face Oranje Meisies in the final match.",Oranje however showed their class to win the final match over the gutsy St.Cyprians with a narrow 1-0 victory.,Scoring a record 28 goals in the tournament they were by far the stand out team of the tournament and defensively they only conceded 2 goals which underline their overall dominance.,Already the DSG U14 Tournament is regarded as one of the premier U14 hockey event in the country and there are plans that 16 teams will be invited to participate in 2019.,Prize winners at this years event were:,York High School – Fair Play Trophy,Best Striker and Player of the Tournament – Tuane van der Westhuizen (OranjeMeisies),Best Midfielder – Kristin Leonard (St Mary’s Waverley),Best Defender – Tamryn Louw (Woodridge College),Best Goalkeeper – Shannon Wylde (Pearson),Final placings for 2018,1st OranjeMeisies,2nd St Cyprians,3rd St Mary’s Waverley,4th Woodridge College,5th Clarendon and Collegiate (final match drawn),7th Bloemhof and Pearson (final match drawn),9th Springfield,10th DSG,11th Somerset College,12th Oakhill,13th York High School,14th VG,Full results from the tournament can be found on www.dsghockeyfestival.co.za,,SA Schoolsports maintained by Yard8

"In just his second season as a Grand Prix driver, Lewis Hamilton became the youngest world champion to date in the most dramatic fashion. Needing to finish fifth in Brazilian rain, Hamilton recovered from a late change to wet tyres to pass Timo Glock on the final corner to take that position and clinch the title by a single point.","McLaren’s young protege’s five victories included the Monaco GP (despite hitting the barrier) and dominating in the wet at Silverstone. He also won the Belgian GP on the road but was controversially penalised 25 seconds for cutting the chicane when most thought he had done nothing wrong. However, there were erratic moments such as crashing into Kimi Raikkonen’s Ferrari in the Canadian pitlane and a wild first corner lunge at Fuji.","Raikkonen won two of the opening four races to lead the championship but his title defence was underwhelming thereafter – the Finn eventually fading to third overall. Instead, it was Felipe Massa who led Ferrari’s challenge. He won six times and only lost in Hungary and Singapore due to a late engine failure and botched pitstop respectively. Victory in Brazil seemed to have snatched the title before Hamilton’s late heroics.",Heikki Kovalainen replaced Fernando Alonso at McLaren but finished a disappointing seventh overall. That included a frightening crash in Spain and inheriting victory in Hungary when Massa retired with just three laps to go. Kovalainen also qualified on pole position at Silverstone and perhaps should have converted another front row start at Monza into victory.,BMW Sauber emerged as genuine challengers and the highly rated Robert Kubica led Nick Heidfeld in a Canadian 1-2 for the team. Kubica excelled and may have sustained a championship campaign if the team had not switched development focus to 2009 before the end of the season.,"Alonso returned to Renault following his unhappy season at McLaren. It was a difficult campaign before the Spaniard scored back-to-back wins in Singapore (F1’s first night race) and Japan. He only started 15th for the former and benefited from a safety car triggered when rookie team-mate Nelson Piquet jr crashed. What would become known as ""Crashgate"" would come to light mid-way through 2009. Piquet struggled although he did score a surprise second place finish in Germany thanks to a one-stop strategy and mid-race safety car.","Mark Webber’s Red Bull qualified on the front row at Silverstone before he crashed on the opening lap. It was team-mate David Coulthard, in his last season before retirement, who scored the team’s best result when third in Canada. Sebastian Vettel remained with the sister Scuderia Toro Rosso for his first full Formula 1 season and scored a sensational win from pole position in the wet Italian GP.","GP2 champion Timo Glock joined Toyota and matched the team’s best result by finishing second in Hungary. Ross Brawn returned from sabbatical as Honda Team Principal and began reorganising the underperforming team. They soon abandoned development of the current car to concentrate on 2009 and Rubens Barrichello scored its only podium when third at Silverstone. However, with the global economy in recession, Honda announced it was withdrawing at the end of the season to put the F1 futures of Barrichello, Jenson Button and the entire team in jeopardy.","Nico Rosberg’s Williams-Toyota was third in Australia and he finished in a fine second-place in Singapore, only losing victory due to the untimely deployment of the safety car. Super Aguri closed its doors after the Spanish GP and Force India – the fourth identity for Eddie Jordan’s former team in as many years – failed to score a point. However, Adrian Sutil only lost an impressive fourth place in Monaco when Raikkonen crashed into him during the closing laps.","We want the content of the database to be driven by you, the readers.

"Introduced in 2006, the Triumph Daytona 675 is a three-cylinder sport bike, and the smallest of the Triumph triples. Built by Triumph Motorcycles, it replaced their four-cylinder Daytona 650. The 675 proved to be remarkably light, nimble and powerful, and it was very successful against the Japanese 600cc competition. In 2016, Triumph ceased production of the base model Daytona 675 citing diminishing demand for super sport bikes and increasingly strict European emission standards. Triumph continued to produce the up spec Triumph Daytona 675R model until the 2018 model year. Triumph filed a new trademark for the Daytona fuelling rumors that there may be a future version sporting the new 765cc engine.","Triumph Daytona 675 development started in 2000 following the launch of the four-cylinder TT600. The TT600 was Triumph's first modern middleweight sports motorcycle but it struggled to compete with Japanese 600 cc' supersport motorcycles. So Triumph decided to manufacture a bike closer to its traditional values, making the crucial technical decision to adopt a three-cylinder power plant, instead of a four-cylinder as in the TT600 .","In 2001, soon after the completion of the similarly three cylinder powered Triumph Daytona 955i, Triumph began engineering analysis to work out weight, engine performance in power and torque. Pleased with the figures, the project moved to the full concept phase in March 2002.","Initial chassis development work was done using a chopped Daytona 600 chassis. Triumph moved the wheelbase, adjusted the head angle, and modified the tank. This new configuration exhibited better performance than the original Daytona 600, forming a basis to compare against competitive bikes such as the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R and Honda CBR600RR. While engine development had not been completed, computer aided chassis development continued with the data collected from these tests.","Design work for the Daytona 675 proceeded, producing a primarily black design based on the Daytona 600. However, this initial design was discarded as great British designs of the 1960s had ""a flowing curved design - no sharp angular aggressive edges"". A member of the engineering team produced a concept drawing of the 675 as a naked bike. Styling was based upon this concept drawing and that of the earlier T595 model. Styling development continued in house, staying close to spirit of earlier Triumph design. Market research groups made up of a variety of different classes of sportbike riders chose the latter design of bike which was refined and adopted for production.","The newly developed engine was first tested on a dynamometer in May 2003. Final development combining styling, engine, chassis into a prototype quickly followed. Prototype testing started in late 2004.","The Daytona 675 was officially launched at the NEC International Motorcycle and Scooter Show in 2005. UK-based Bike was given an exclusive test ride prior to the official launch, impressing the magazine test rider. The magazine declared it ""the best British sportsbike ever"" and ""possibly one of the greatest sportsbikes of all time"".","The Daytona 675 won the Supersport category for the Masterbike 2006 (finishing third overall), and won again in 2007.","The 2008 model has a dry weight of 363.7 lb (165.0 kg) and wet weight of 407 lb (185 kg). Tested power output is rated at 104.4 hp (77.9 kW) @ 12,100 rpm with torque of 53.3 lbf·ft (72.3 N·m) @ 11,750 rpm.","""Motor Cycle News"" declared, ""The Triumph Daytona 675 has put Hinckley firm back on the shortlist of many UK sports motorcycle riders, who previously rated the 600 and 650 Daytona models as being OK, but no real alternative to a Japanese four cylinder 600cc sportbikes. Silky, compact handling, allied to kick-ass engine power and a howling exhaust note, make the Triumph Daytona 675 a real winner on the road, or track.""","Triumph planned intended to build only 4,000 Daytona 675 models for 2006, with 1,000 marked for the UK, 2,000 for the US, and 1,000 for the rest of the world. Customer demand was very strong, with waiting lists of three months or more in the US and the UK, and even longer in several other parts of the world.","In 2007, Performance Bikes Magazine ran a 24-hour racetrack comparison test between a Daytona 675 and a Suzuki GSXR750. Although a mechanical fault prevented the 675 from completing the test, the Triumph had till then consistently outpaced the more powerful Suzuki, averaging 0.7 seconds a lap faster. (It later transpired that the 675's engine failure was down to a broken valve, a result of incorrect servicing)","As the TT 600 morphed through the Daytona 600, 650, and finally became the 675, it produced considerable interest and more privateers entered AMA and regional events. When the Daytona 675 was launched there were no factory-backed racing teams. This changed in 2008 when MAP Embassy Racing struck a deal with Triumph, and entered the 2008 British Supersport Championship. On 5 May 2008, Glen Richards scored the first win for a Triumph-backed team since 2004 and scored three further wins on his way to the championship.","Before 2008 several privateers were racing the Triumph Daytona 675 without any official factory support. In the British Supersport Championship 2006, Daytonas were raced by Paul Young and Christian Elkin.","During the development phase, Triumph made representations to the Isle of Man TT for a 675 triple to race in the 600 class. With a successful outcome, a Daytona was raced by New Zealander Paul Dobbs in the 2006 TT. On 11 August 2006, The Triumph Daytona 675 was cleared for entry into the AMA Formula Xtreme class for 2007. The Daytona 675 was used by Team SC in the 2008 Supersport World Championship. The factory supported team was called Triumph-SC and has Garry McCoy and Ilario Dionisi as riders.","There is also a Daytona 675 one-make series called Triumph Triple Challenge. This is run in conjunction with Bemsee Race Club and operated under the Motorcycle Racing Organisation (MRO) format. It is a series run by T3 Racing over nine rounds, with a 2007 entry cost £12,000, which included ownership of a Daytona 675.","The Triumph Daytona 675 faces a different set of rules and restrictions when it competes in American Motorcycle Racing events. Although Triumph NA has not sponsored any American teams in the last several decades, privateers began racing Triumphs in AMA races as early as 2002 when the Augusta Triumph/Ducati Racing Team fielded a TT 600. It was the first Triumph to make the top 20 when it finished 17th at Road Atlanta.","In the same year (2007) that the Daytona 675 debuted in AMA events, Augusta Triumph/Ducati Racing Team members won regional titles at both the expert and novice levels in four racing categories. 2009 was a very good year for the Daytona 675. In May the Augusta Triumph/Ducati Racing Team had a podium finish in AMA. In their competition in Moto GT the team of Mark Crozier and Phil Caudill scored with a first place finish at Barber Motorsports Park. Their Daytona 675 was the first time the Triumph Daytona 675 took the pole in an AMA event. It led 19 of 40 laps and is the first time that the Daytona 675 has ever placed first in an AMA event. The Augusta Triumph team went on to win the AMA Pro Moto GT1 season championship with one race remaining on the calendar.","The ParkinGO Triumph BE1 Racing World Supersport team also had a good run in 2009, finishing fifth in the manufacturer's standings in the team's first year of competition. Team rider Garry McCoy earned two podium finishes during the season, the first at Donington and the second at Portimao.","In 2010, the Augusta Triumph/Ducati Racing Team fielded their 675 in the WERA Southeast and North Florida regions, winning a total of four championships, WERA SE Heavyweight Twins Superbike Expert and Heavyweight Twins Superstock Expert; WERA North Florida Heavyweight Twins Superbike Expert and Heavyweight Twins Superstock Expert. In October, rider Giovanni Rojas added a fifth title by winning the 2010 Grand National Heavyweight Twins Superstock Expert Championship at Road Atlanta which gave the team a national title.","The 2009 model of the Daytona has had over 50 technical improvements according to Triumph. While the only cosmetic changes were to the front fairing and turn signals, the new model is lighter, the ECU has been remapped to increase the rev limit and produce a power increase of 3 hp (2.2 kW), a taller first gear, and handling has improved through high and low speed dampers. In addition, the 2009 model's ECU is compatible with Triumph's OEM plug and play quickshifter.","The 2010 model year is virtually unchanged from the 2009 Daytona 675 apart from a redesigned instrument cluster. The new instruments have a more modern appearance, but do not offer any new functionality as compared to the older design.","Triumph also offered a 2010 Special Edition (SE) Daytona 675 with a Pearl White paint scheme on the bodywork, blue frame, adjustable levers and carbon fiber infill panels. Two versions of the SE were produced, one with the new 2010 instrument cluster and one without.","The 2011 Daytona 675 Special Edition has the same Pearl White bodywork and Blue frame as the 2010 model, but also included as standard carbon fiber replacements for the cockpit infill panels, exhaust heat shield, exhaust cap, and rear hugger as well as Triumph's aftermarket adjustable levers. Unlike the 2010 SE, the 2011 SE also includes the updated gauge cluster first found in the standard 2010 model, as well as a new racing-inspired decal design.","First offered in early 2011, but still part of the 2011 model year, Triumph debuted the Daytona 675R. The 675R did not feature any changes to the engine, instead Triumph's focus was on the standard inclusion of Brembo front brakes, Öhlins suspension, and Triumph's quickshifter. The 675R has carbon fiber front mudguard, rear hugger, exhaust cap, heat shield, and cockpit infill panels.","The 2013 Triple motor is more compact and a little more powerful due to a shorter stroke ratio. The bike has a smaller, lighter and narrower frame. It has a bigger airbox, new swingarm, slipper clutch and lighter wheels. Other changes include a fuel gauge and a side mounted exhaust instead of the underseat setup from previous models and rear Brembo brakes on the Standard 675. ABS is an option on the standard bike.",ABS made standard equipment. Slipper Clutch and Quick shifter (Up Shift only) is implemented.,All specifications are manufacturer claimed and estimated unless otherwise noted:,

adamsonmedia.com,Sports and humor from Scott Adamson,"February 23, 2019 by Scott Adamson 1 Comment",I’m genuinely excited about Sunday’s matchup between the 2-0 Birmingham Iron and 0-2 Atlanta Legends at Georgia State Stadium.,Is it because it’s a Week 3 clash between a pair of Eastern Conference rivals in the Alliance of American Football?,"Sure, there’s that; I’m enjoying this league a lot and the more I see, the more I like.","Or maybe it’s because it features two of my favorite American cities. Even though I don’t currently live in Birmingham it’s my hometown, and I’ve developed a real fondness for Atlanta over the years.","But for me, the historical significance of the game is the biggest reason I’m eager to watch.","In fact, it’s been 45 years in the making.",Sometime during the summer of 1974 – while the World Football League Birmingham Americans were riding a 10-game winning streak – I was thinking big.,"The Ams were the class of the upstart circuit, and the WFL would, quite obviously, last forever. I mean, I assumed it was formed as a personal favor to all football-crazy 13 year olds like me who didn’t previously have a pro team in their city, so it was implied that we’d grow old together.","The first order of business was for Birmingham to become the dominant franchise in the league, and not knowing any better, I figured the WFL was already the National Football League’s equal.","And even though they were separate leagues and had an adversarial relationship from the get-go, I wanted nothing more than for the Americans to play – and destroy – the Atlanta Falcons.",Why?,"Because I was jealous of Atlanta, and wanted Birmingham to beat it at something.","See, in the early 1950s, the two cities were roughly the same size and basically had an equal shot at becoming the biggest of the big Southeastern cities.","But while my town had become infamous for clinging to Jim Crow laws, their town was working toward a more progressive – and inclusive – future.","So when businesses looked for opportunities, they looked at Atlanta. And when it came time for an international airport to be built, the “Empire City of the South” got it.","There were a number of factors, of course, but the air hub was game, set and match. It will likely always be Atlanta’s biggest victory over the Magic City.","It’s a major reason why the Birmingham Falcons, Birmingham Braves and Birmingham Hawks never were and will never be.","But Birmingham was going through a renaissance in the 1970s, and I just knew pro football – WFL style – was going to help it give the ATL some competition.","Besides, while Birmingham was in the midst of a season that would end with a WFL championship, the lowly Falcons were stumbling to a 3-11 mark.","Oh, how I wanted the NFL and WFL to agree to exhibition games, in the hopes that a Falcons vs. Americans game would take place.","Of course, I knew nothing about the business side of pro sports and didn’t realize such a pairing was out of the question before the question was ever asked.",But I had convinced myself Birmingham could beat Atlanta in football and maybe – just maybe – that would in some weird way close the prestige gap between the cities.,We’ll never know.,"The WFL barely survived its first season and didn’t make it through its second. In fact, on October 19, 1975, Atlanta lost to the Los Angeles Rams, 22-7, while Birmingham beat the Memphis Southmen, 21-0.","But three days later the Falcons were back on the practice field prepping for a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, while Birmingham’s WFL team (renamed the Vulcans) were no more.","The World Football League folded on Oct. 22, 1975.","So not only was I denied a chance to see Birmingham earn bragging rights over Atlanta on the gridiron, I was denied a team, period.","There have been others since then – the Birmingham Stallions (USFL), Birmingham Fire (World League of American Football), Birmingham Barracudas (CFL) and Birmingham Bolts (XFL) – yet until the Alliance came along, there was no opportunity for Birmingham versus Atlanta.","The record will show that on February 24, 2019, that finally changes.",The Alliance isn’t the NFL – or even the WFL – but it’s a quality spring league that’s going to give me a sporting event I’ve always wanted to see.,It’s about time.,Filed Under: Alternative Football,Taylor P. says,"February 25, 2019 at 2:57 pm","Great article Scott! As a 35 year old boy, I’ve been waiting for the BHM-ATL matchup for a long time myself. I hope we have more of these matchups in the future.",Your email address will not be published.

BRUTAL HONESTY. A mix of Old School and New School. A Sports Blog like you've never seen before.,Extra games. Extra innings. Extra FUN!!,That’s what the young MLB postseason has brought home from the toy store.,"Starting with not one, but two, game 163s, both the National League West and Central divisions were decided in winner-take-all fashion Monday night. The winners, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers, were rewarded with an actual (five game) series. The losers, the Chicago Cubs and Colorado Rockies, had the pleasure of enduring the stress of win-or-go-home Tuesday night. After an impressive 95-67 season, the Chicago Cubs had the displeasure of losing consecutive games, and will watch the postseason like the rest of us — from their couch.","A ruthless diatribe on the inane nature of the one-game-playoff (in MLB) will not be found here today, for one man can only belabor the same point so many times….","The Rockies, behind Kyle Freeland, the best pitcher you’ve never heard of, took down the Cubs 2-1 F/13. The Rockies now have the privilege of traveling to Milwaukee to take on the Brewers in the National League Division Series.","This series should be a good time, as the Rockies have won 10-of-their-last-12, and the Brewers have won 10-of-their-last-11.",But….that’s enough talk about the league that will inevitably finish in 2nd place….,"Tonight, the 100-win New York Yankees will face-off against the bullpen-gaming Oakland Athletics. Man, what has happened to MLB?! It’s win-or-go-home at Yankee Stadium, as Luis Severino will take the bump for the pinstripes. For the Athletics, Liam Hendriks will get the “start”. I’m not saying this because I’m a Yankee fan, but if they can’t knock this clown around, they don’t deserve to play the Boston Red Sox.","I mean..I dare you to name 10 players on the Athletics’ roster….Oh no, take your time. I’ll wait….","Gary Sanchez, despite the uninformed public’s opinion, will be behind the plate (where he belongs). And the Yankees will waste a roster spot for this game by carrying three catchers.","We can dissect, debate, think, and rethink the potential outcome of this game until the cows come home. But at the end of the day, there’s no reason the Yankees should lose. And IF they figure out how to lose, don’t call the fire department….",,Let the streets burn.,"Score Prediction: Yankees 6, Athletics 3.",Boom!,,Leave your incorrect predictions in the comment section below.,,A lot has happened in the last 635 days.,"No, I won’t make a list, just take my word for it….","It’s hard to fathom being as bad as the Cleveland Browns. But, despite walking around with that rancid, putrid, rotten taste of losing they can’t seem to wash out of their mouths, they won a football game Thursday night. A football game — in real life.","When NFL teams look at their schedule for an upcoming season, they “circle” winnable games. Every team should circle every game by the way, but hey, what do I know?! Thursday night, the Jets circled the Browns, and the Browns circled the Jets. That’s what you get when two “bottom-third” teams play each other. While neither team is running to buy plane tickets to Super Bowl LIII, it made for an exciting game.","What started as a defensive struggle, ended with a 4th quarter comeback. Yes, Baker Mayfield, the #1 pick in the 2018 draft, entered the game and brought Cleveland their 1st taste of victory since December 24th, 2016.","Was Mayfield impressive?? Absolutely. Should Browns’ fans rejoice?? Of course. Hell, I’d be dancing up and down the streets if I were them. BUT, this doesn’t mean Baker Mayfield is the next coming of John Elway. It doesn’t mean selecting Mayfield over Darnold was the right decision. And it doesn’t mean he will have a good career. It’s simply a really good performance in his 1st action in the NFL.",Don’t forget he was playing the Jets….,"Ah yes, my Jets. The same way I’m not going to overreact to Mayfield’s efficient performance, I’m not going to overreact to Darnold’s perceived struggles. They’re undoubtedly talented, but they’re rookies. Now is the time to find the positives in Darnold’s performances. Now is the time to open your eyes and see that the Jets’ offensive line is terrible. Now is the time to recognize that Todd Bowles is the worst head coach in the NFL.","Darnold is scrambling for his life (showing off his spectacular footwork — a.k.a. his survival skills). Robby Anderson has no clue how to hold on to a football. Terrelle Pryor Sr. has forgotten everything there is to know about football. And, did I mention Todd Bowles is the worst head coach in the NFL????","While the Jets lost 21-17 (the exact score I predicted hours before kickoff) to the Browns, wins and losses aren’t a concern.",SAM DARNOLD’S PROGRESS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS!!!!,"Envision 2020. Close your eyes if necessary. Picture Tom Brady’s retirement ceremony. The AFC East is up for grabs. And Sam Darnold, paired with a good offensive line, wide receivers who can catch, and a defensive line that gets pressure on opposing quarterbacks, stand atop their division.",Now that….is a world I can get used to living in.,,What do you think of Sam Darnold?? Baker Mayfield?? Post your instantaneous reactions in the comment section below.,"Hey, you!!",Don’t jump!!,Step down from the ledge and slowly..walk..away.,"While New York’s MLB teams are having polar opposite seasons, both seem ready to hit the panic button….",The New York Yankees,"The Yankees have the 3rd best record in MLB (63-35). They’re in the midst of a spectacular season, on pace to win 104 games, and head to the postseason for the one billionth time. However, Yankee fans, alongside local writers and talk show hosts, are leaning toward the panic button — again. That’s my cue….",Allow me to say the same thing I said when the Yankees were 9-9 (on April 20th):,"Yes, I’m aware they’re 13-13 since June 22nd. Yes, I’m also aware they’re 6 games back of the Red Sox in the AL East. And YES, I’m aware if they don’t win the division they’ll have to settle for a (ridiculous) one-game playoff. But let’s stop pretending the Yankees are falling off a cliff. Offensively speaking, they either lead, or are in the top-five, of the following statistical categories:",Lead: home runs (162) and slugging percentage (.462),"Top-Five: runs (511), total bases (1555), r.b.i. (493), and on base percentage (.332)","And while everyone is freaking out, clamoring for a new starting pitcher, their pitching staff ranks in the top-five of the following categories:","Top-Five: e.r.a. (3.56), ks (977), saves (30), and runs allowed (382)","Now, I’m not saying everything is perfect. The Red Sox ARE 40 GAMES OVER .500 (71-31)!!!! And while I trust Luis Severino, and the Yankees, in a home, one-game playoff against the Seattle Mariners, ANYTHING can happen.","Have I mentioned how much I despise this wild card, playoff format?!","Hell, if Severino pitches like he did Monday night, the Yankees’ postseason will be over before it starts. Which brings me to Mr. Gary Sanchez, the laziest man in show business. The Yankees lost 7-6 to the Tampa Bay Rays Monday night. While Sanchez wasn’t the sole reason the Yankees lost, he certainly DID NOT help their cause:",http://www.espn.com/core/video/iframe?id=24178715&endcard=false,"Gary, Gary, Gary….","Gary Sanchez is the most talented, offensive catcher in baseball. Despite his despicable .188 batting average this season, he’s in scoring position every time he steps in the batter’s box. However, effort, energy, and hustle are not things you’re born with. They are not predetermined. ANYONE can hustle!! So, for Gary Sanchez to lollygag after a baseball, that bounced off his own foot, down the 3rd baseline, and allow a runner to score from 2nd base, is inexcusable. For Gary Sanchez to not run out a ground out, because he THOUGHT the play was going to 2nd base, is reprehensible. Side Note: It did go to 2nd base. And he was still thrown out at 1st.","While the Yankees need Sanchez’s bat in the lineup, he MUST be benched for at least one game.","The moral of the story is the Yankees will be fine. It couldn’t hurt to add a starting pitcher along the lines of Chris Archer or J.A. Happ, but I won’t freak out if they stand pat.",**For those who read this far….THANK YOU!! This is also a friendly reminder that I am a rare breed of human. They call me an ‘Objective Yankee Fan’.**,,Check back with DaveTalksSports.com tomorrow to catch me tie a pretty little bow around the ineptitude we call the New York Mets.,This has been a unique week….,"How often do two top-five players, in different sports, get traded in the same week?!",Kawhi Leonard Gets Shipped North Of The Border,"Ask, and you shall receive. The only thing is, you don’t always get exactly what you ask for. Despite being lauded as the NBA’s gold standard over the past two decades, the San Antonio Spurs and Kawhi Leonard grew out of love. In June, Leonard publicly requested a trade. Leonard’s destination wish-list was short: The Los Angeles Lakers.","As hard as it is to imagine Gregg Popovich laughing, he probably doubled over when he heard Leonard’s request.","Oh, you want to play in sunny California, for one of the most storied franchises in NBA history, in Popovich’s conference?!?! That’s cute. Instead, Leonard was banished to the Toronto Raptors for the final year of his contract. In return, the Spurs received DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, and a 2022 1st-round top-20 protected pick.",The Spurs won this trade — by a lot.,"Yes, Leonard is better than DeRozan, so (assuming Leonard is a good soldier this year) the Raptors have a chance in the Eastern Conference. However, knowing Leonard wasn’t going to resign with the Spurs, and CLEARLY isn’t going to resign with the Raptors, the haul the Spurs got for their disgruntled (rental) superstar is astonishing. DeRozan is an all-star who’s under contract for three more years. And don’t sleep on the 22-year old, seven-footer (Poeltl). He’s the type of player Popovich turns into a 10 point, 8 rebound machine, providing depth in the frontcourt.",I’m Moving To Los Angeles!!,It’s good to be Manny Machado.,"It’s not every day you start your day on the worst team in MLB (Baltimore Orioles), and end your day on a World Series contender (Los Angeles Dodgers). Also, the weather is slightly better in L.A. than Baltimore — last time I checked.",Like I said….it’s GOOD to be Manny Machado.,"Just like Kawhi Leonard, Manny Machado is a top-five player in his respective sport. Just like Leonard, Machado is an expiring contract, and wasn’t expected to resign with his former team. And just like Leonard, Machado helped bring his former team quite the haul.","The Orioles received five prospects for Machado: outfielder Yusniel Diaz, right-handed pitchers Dean Kremer and Zach Pop, and infielders Rylan Bannon and Breyvic Valera.","Diaz is the prize here, as he was ranked #73 in Baseball Prospectus’ rankings prior to this season.","This deal makes sense for both sides. The Orioles read the tea leaves and did what they had to do, while the Dodgers immediately launched themselves into World Series contention.","And Machado seems to have adjusted nicely to his new home. He’s hitting a smooth .385 through his first three games. Yeah, he’s pretty good.","With just eight days remaining until the MLB trade deadline, stay up to date with every move on DaveTalksSports.com.",You say these are the ‘dog days’ of Summer.,I say….you’re an idiot.,There’s A LOT going on in the world of sports:,"Wimbledon, The World Cup, MLB’s All-Star Game/Home Run Derby, and The Open Championship.",Wimbledon,The Novak is back!!,"After coming up empty-handed in his last eight Grand Slams, Novak Djokovic has reclaimed his spot amongst the games elite.

I’ll put it on as background noise tonight, however, this year’s Derby is lacking the most important thing of all; Star Power.",The Open Championship,Allow me to preface this statement — with a statement:,"My subconscious has NOTHING to do, in any way, with my rational, conscious thought process.","Sunday night, I dreamt that Tiger Woods won the 2018 Open Championship. For those who skim articles, I’m going to repeat myself. I don’t think there’s a snowball’s chance in hell that happens, but I dreamt it. Tiger Woods is a shell of himself. While he still moves the needle (inexplicably), he has literally NO CHANCE to win a Major. Not now. Not ever.",Have a nice day!,Accomplishments walk hand-in-hand with expectations.,"As crazy as this is about to sound, NO ONE expected Serena Williams to win Wimbledon. Don’t lie to me. I don’t appreciate it. Yet she’s just one match away from doing the improbable (nothing is impossible for Serena Williams).","See 316 days ago, Serena Williams was giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. And while Serena always planned to return to the game she loves, even she didn’t expect to compete for her record 24th Grand Slam Title this soon, “It’s crazy. I don’t even know how to feel, you know, because literally, I didn’t expect to do this well in my fourth tournament back.”","Ranked 25th for this year’s All England Championship, some felt she was ranked too high after a lengthy hiatus. Wimbledon, however, doesn’t play by your rules. They don’t concern themselves with world rankings. And with 9-out-of-the-top-10 players ousted before the 4th round, Serena’s path became that much easier. Not to diminish Serena’s accomplishment, but this is the worst performance by top-10 seeds in the Open Era. After steamrolling Julia Georges in just 1 hour and 9 minutes in the semifinals (6-2, 6-4), Serena should be well rested for Saturday’s finals.","Now, only Angelique Kerber stands in Serena’s way of completing one of the most impressive feats in professional tennis history.","See 274 days ago, Serena Williams was climbing out of bed for the 1st time after complications from child birth. Immediately following her daughter’s birth, Serena suffered a pulmonary embolism and blood clots in her lungs. While her doctors quickly had her on the road to recovery, she was confined to bed rest for six weeks.","Ahhhhh, yes, the realization is setting in for you, my reader, of the magnitude of Serena’s accomplishments at Wimbledon. To come from a near-death experience, to her 10th Wimbledon Final’s appearance in less than year, is not something human beings often (or ever) do.","See in 1 day, Serena Williams WILL win her 8th Wimbledon Title. She WILL continue to make history. And she WILL defy the odds.","And all we’ll be able to do, is appreciate the accomplishment, and throw expectations out the window.","Prediction: 7-6, 6-4 (The Best Who Ever Did It — Serena Williams)","Tune-in to ESPN Saturday, July 14th @ 9:00 A.M. EST to catch all the action.",,"Although nearly a week has passed, Islanders’ fans are still mourning the loss of John Tavares. No, he’s not dead, but he left for Canada (they’re almost the same thing).","John Tavares became an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2017-2018 NHL season. For months, stories and rumors, predicting Tavares’ landing spot, floated around the NHL universe. The Islanders, despite their lack of success in recent history, did everything possible to convince Tavares to stay in New York….",All this….was for naught.,"The New York Islanders knew this day could come. Despite drafting him #1 overall in the 2009 NHL Draft, Tavares is from Mississauga, Ontario (right next to Toronto).",“Not everyday you can live a childhood dream.”,Enter collective sigh here ————–>,"Listen, the Islanders are not to blame here. It’s not everyday a diehard fan, turned professional athlete, gets the pick of the litter. And the top-pick of the litter happens to be a Stanley Cup contender, just footsteps from his childhood treehouse. Hell, I’d have made the same decision as Tavares. It just sucks that I also happen to be an Islanders’ fan.","So, Tavares will enjoy the next seven seasons, at home, getting paid $77 million along the way.",Oh well New York….,I guess you’ll just have to wait for another generational superstar to fall into your lap….,,Who do you blame for John Tavares choosing the Toronto Maple Leafs over the New York Islanders??,The NBA is BROKEN!!,"It’s also stupid, and imbalanced, and predictable, and irrational, and stupid.","I’ve asked this question before, but let’s give it another try: If you already knew the outcome of a game, would you still watch?? You’d have to be insane to say yes. No. The answer is no. Soooooooooooo, why would anybody watch the NBA?!?!","The Golden State Warriors have won three out of the last four NBA Finals. Even before they added DeMarcus Cousins to their roster, Monday, they were headed toward a three-peat. Although Cousins is working his way back from a ruptured Achilles, he is a top-10 player (when healthy). Since increasing his assist totals, and three-point percentage, he’s become the most versatile big man in the league.","I’m aware of Anthony Davis’ skillset, however, the ability to pass the ball AND shoot the three puts Cousins in a league of his own.","There’s some speculation on Cousins’ path to the Warriors, but as with any story, there are three sides (yours, mine, and the truth).",Cousins claims the Warriors were the only team to offer him a contract….,I’m not saying I don’t believe him….BUT I DON’T BELIEVE HIM.,"A report leaked that the New Orleans Pelicans offered Cousins a two-year, $40 million contract. Also, the Los Angeles Lakers claim they turned Cousins down. Also not believable. But if that’s true, the Lakers should punch themselves in the face — immediately.","No matter how Cousins landed on the Warriors, the upcoming season is over. It was over without Cousins. As long as their starting five remain healthy, and under contract, they’ll continue to win championship after championship.","So, now that we’ve established the NBA is broken, DaveTalksSports is going to fix it. With the salary cap increasing every year, and the presence of a “soft” salary cap, ‘Super Teams’ will never cease to exist.",DeMarcus Cousins should not be allowed to join the Warriors for $5.3 million.,"While we live in a free-market, capitalist society, the NBA is a private organization. They should regulate themselves as they see fit. Instituting a pay scale, based on performance, would solve this problem. his would actually help better players earn more money.",Sounds ridiculously fair to me.,"This pay scale would be based on statistical performances, plus 1st-team, 2nd-team, and 3rd-team accomplishments (offensively and defensively). The league and the player’s association would then need to agree on how many players from each “tier” would be allowed on a single team. This would create parody, fair play, and a fair season, ultimately resulting in a product that DaveTalksSports (and the world) would want to watch.","As presently constructed, I will NOT be watching the NBA this upcoming season.",That is all. Thanks!,,LeBron James is going to play for the Los Angeles Lakers.,"Re-read that. Let it sink in. Still sounds weird, doesn’t it??","While he could have dragged out his decision, creating another ‘Summer of LeBron’, he wasted little time. NBA’s free agency moratorium period began on July 1st at 12:00 a.m. Just 17 hours later, LeBron informed the world, via Klutch Sports, he would be donning purple and gold next season.","**The moratorium period runs from July 1st through July 6th. This means free agents may discuss, and announce contracts, however can’t officially sign on the dotted line until the end of this period.**","LeBron’s move to one of the most storied franchises in NBA history is not surprising. It’s never a bad idea to join forces with Magic Johnson, while carrying the torch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kobe Bryant have kept lit for over 40 years. His contract, however, is surprising. LeBron James has made the one-year contract cool. This method has allowed LeBron the freedom to skip town the second stuff hits the fan, maximize his earning potential, and keep the ball in his court. How many idioms can I squeeze into one sentence?? The answer, apparently, is three.","LeBron’s contract: 4 years, $154 million (4th year player option)","LeBron is giving Magic the most valuable gift imaginable; time. Having the peace of mind that LeBron won’t be going anywhere for a minimum of three seasons is priceless. Now, Magic can shift, shape, and maneuver accordingly.",Which naturally begs the question: Who ELSE is coming to La La Land??,"Everyone and their grandmother assumed Paul George to the Lakers was a done deal. However, he and Russell Westbrook’s party burst that bubble before midnight on Saturday….","Will the San Antonio Spurs acquiesce to Kawhi Leonard’s demands, and trade him to the Lakers?? I don’t know. They want a King’s ransom, and the Lakers should give it, but just because I say it doesn’t mean it’ll happen.","Will the Lakers sign Demarcus Cousins?? They should. They have a meeting setup with Cousins, so the world will see how far Magic’s smile can carry him.",Final Thought,"The NBA is the big winner here. The league is better, and happier, when the Lakers are good. It’s also beneficial when the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, and other big markets are competitive too. Two-out-of-three ain’t bad. There was no better era in basketball than the 1980s: Showtime Lakers vs. Bird’s Celtics. There’s no guarantee this will be that, but if the Lakers bring in another top-10 player this year, and Klay Thompson next year, ya never know.",,Thoughts. Questions. And concerns. You know where those go….,We’ve saved the worst….for last.,"Yesterday, we broke down the good half (American League). Today, we’ll get to the half that still (inexplicably) lets pitchers hit (National League)….",National League,Best Team – Arizona Diamondbacks,"This was harder than it looks. Figuring out the best team in the National League is like ranking your favorite diseases. At 47-34, the Diamondbacks have the 2nd best record in the National League (Milwaukee Brewers: 47-33). While the Diamondbacks, and Paul Goldschmidt, had a May to forget (Goldschmidt hit .144 in May, and the team went 8-19), they’ve bounced back to the tune of 19-7 in June.","Robbie Ray is back. Zack Godley is pitching to his abilities (again). And the other Zack (Greinke) is 5-1 since May. While the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants are nipping at their heels, expect the Diamondbacks to win their 1st NL West Division Title since 2011.",Biggest Surprise – Milwaukee Brewers,"I knew the Milwaukee Brewers were a good baseball team. I just didn’t know they’d be THIS good. To have the best record in the National League, with THIS pitching staff, is no small feat. If you can name the entire starting rotation for the Brewers, I’ll make your next car payment. I’m serious. GO ahead. I’ll wait….",Even ‘The Google’ doesn’t know.,"The Brewers’ roster is filled with a long list of good players. No superstars. No CY Young Award candidates. Just good, do a little bit of everything, players. Only time will tell if they can hold off the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central Division.",MVP – Freddie Freeman,"Until May 14th (my birthday), A.J. Pollock was running away with the NL MVP Award. And then he got hurt. Now, your guess is as good as mine….","While the aforementioned Paul Goldschmidt has turned his life around, he’s not the MVP. Freddie is. Freddie Freeman is having the best season of his career. He’s on pace for 31 home runs, 111 rbi, and 12 sbs with a .318 batting average.","Oh, and the Atlanta Braves are in 1st place in the NL East (45-34).",CY Young – Max Scherzer,"As deserving as Jacob deGrom is of a CY Young Award, Max Scherzer is THAT much better than deGrom. If this was the ‘I Feel Really Badly For You Award’, deGrom would be the unanimous victor. However, Max Scherzer is the best pitcher in MLB.","Now, OPEN YOUR EARS AND LISTEN:",Max Scherzer has been the best pitcher in MLB for the past seven years.,"Yes, I’m aware Clayton Kershaw has been in MLB for the past seven years as well. But I’m also aware that you can’t win baseball games from the trainer’s room. While Clayton Kershaw’s stuff is unparalleled, Max Scherzer’s durability makes him the best, most consistent pitcher in MLB.",,Do you think I’m crazy?!?!

"SOUTH BEND – Notre Dame is still nearly two weeks away from its Cotton Bowl matchup against second-ranked Clemson, but the Irish are already deep into their preparation for the most important game the program has played in almost six years.","The No. 3 Irish learned Dec. 2 they would be facing the Tigers in the College Football Playoff on Dec. 29, giving Notre Dame four weeks to learn everything there is to know about one of the best teams in the country.","The first two weeks of that preparation found the Irish mostly inward-focused, doing drills in practice that will help them improve individually, rather than anything Clemson-specific.","“(Energy in practice) has been great,” linebacker Drue Tranquill said. “We've gotten back to focusing on our fundamentals and technique and really grinding on our individual periods, that's been the focus in practice.”","Coach Brian Kelly has preached all season about “the process,” taking the season one game at a time, one week at a time and not looking ahead. To a man, the players have bought into that message and have remained locked in on the specific task in front of them.","That process has gotten a little skewed now that the Irish will have five weeks between games, but Tranquill said the mindset has remained the same. The path to the game has been laid out for them, just as it is for every other game. There is simply more time for preparation.","“I wouldn't say it's easy (staying focused for five weeks without a game), but it's something we've trained for,” the Carroll graduate said. “We have 12 weeks of experience just focusing on the present now, and I think guys have grown into being able to do that and be great at that.","“We like to break our journey down into pieces. This week it was passing final exams and having everyone eligible, (next) week it's going to be getting into Clemson prep and then it's going to be enjoying time with our families before we go to Dallas.”","Staying in the moment will be especially important for the Irish as they take on a Clemson team that has a wealth of experience in the CFP at its disposal. Tigers seniors have been in the playoff four straight years, and the matchup against Notre Dame will be the sixth game they've played in those circumstances.","Notre Dame can't hope to match that level of experience, but Kelly plans to do everything he can leading up to the game to make sure that the atmosphere isn't intimidating for the Irish.","“I don't know that there's really any magic bullet that you have to get that (experience), other than we have an experienced football team,” Kelly said. “There's a lot of veterans that have played, logged a lot of miles, played in some big games. But we're not going to be able to duplicate (five) playoff games.",“What I think we've been really good at is staying in the moment and treating each game as they have come. And we'll do the same thing here.”,"So far, Kelly has seen the focus he wants from his team. It helps that there has been some chatter about whether Notre Dame actually “deserved” the No. 3 ranking, which the coach said has kept the Irish hungry and motivated. Being 11-point underdogs against the Tigers doesn't hurt, either.","“They've listened to everybody talk about how they are underdogs,” Kelly said. “So there's a little bit of that. But this is really about keeping this (season) going and winning a football game, more so than any of the big picture stuff.”",dsinn@jg.net

Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. was third.,"""It's humbling and an honor to be named AP Player of the Year, to be mentioned in the same realm as a lot of great players, a lot of hall of famers,"" Murray said. ""It's a special deal for me and hopefully I can continue to make my family and teammates proud.""",Murray received 39 first-place votes and a total of 145 points. Tagovailoa received 13 first-place votes (117 points) and Haskins was listed first on four ballots (55 points).,"All three are finalists for the Heisman Trophy, which will be presented Saturday night in New York. Murray and Tagovailoa will face each other in the College Football Playoff, when No. 1 Alabama plays No. 4 Oklahoma at the Orange Bowl semifinal on Dec. 29.","Murray joins Baker Mayfield (2017), Josh Heupel (2000), Jason White (2003) and Sam Bradford (2008) as previous winners from Oklahoma. No other school has had more than two players win AP Player of the Year.","Murray, a 5-foot-10, 195-pound junior from Allen, Texas, won the award in his final year as a college athlete. The Oakland Athletics took Murray with the ninth pick in the Major League Baseball draft in June. Murray, who batted .296 with 10 home runs and 13 doubles in 50 games as the Sooners' center fielder, signed for nearly $5 million, with the A's agreeing to let him return to school and play football this season.","Murray was Mayfield's backup last season and won the starter's job in preseason practice.

"March 2, 2011 | Lynchburg, VA","Follow me— Liberty University uses hockey as a medium to minister to athletes during the summer. Above, Liberty DI assistant hockey coach Jeff Boettger demonstrates good backpedal technique. Photo credit: Les Schofer The month of July has plenty of sounds — like the sound of the ocean and the sound of laughter. But this July, the sound of skates cutting ice and hockey sticks slapping pucks will be heard at the Liberty University Christian Hockey School (LU-CHS), where hockey and the love of Christ come together. The Christian-based camp will take place from July 24 to July 28 according to camp director Jeff Boettger, who is also the associate director at the LaHaye Ice Center and Liberty's D1 assistant men's hockey coach. Boettger said that last year there were more than 100 campers who came to the camp, ranging from ages 7 to 18. LU-CHS is both a day camp and a residential camp. Females can participate as day campers, but according to Boettger, it is targeted more towards boys. The residential campers stay in the dorms on Liberty's campus and their activities take place mostly at the LaHaye Ice Center. The campers are split into three different groups, depending primarily on age, and they spend a majority of their day practicing on the ice, developing skills and conditioning off of the ice, participating in activities and going to an afternoon chapel service. The camp is staffed with counselors on a 10-to-1 ratio, approximately, as well as on-ice instructors, the chaplains, a visiting nurse and an instructor for the off-ice conditioning, Boettger said. Boettger said that although hockey is often looked at as a rough sport that is filled with a variety of tough characters, the LU-CHS can give it a positive light by having a Christ-centered focus. ""We want to build relationships, get these kids exposed and see the Christian kids grow,"" Boettger said. ""(We want them to) know they can be athletes in a competitive, perceptively violent sport, but maintain integrity with their faith."" According to Boettger, there are two different chapel services, one for kids ages 12 and younger and one for teenagers. David Semenyna, an assistant coach for Liberty's D2 hockey team who will be counseling for his third year, said it is the most prevalent way that the campers experience the spiritual aspect of the camp. However, Boettger also said that the counselors reach out to the kids on more of an individual basis through their counselor groups and even just when they are hanging out and doing different activities. ""That might be a time where the kids are asking questions,"" Boettger said. ""So (the counselors) can speak into their lives or share their own story at some point. We encourage them to take that opportunity."" The counselors do work to build relationships with the campers. They love getting to see the different personalities of the campers, according to Mike Binnie, goalie coach for Liberty's D1 hockey team. He said a lot of the kids will come back multiple summers, which allows the staff to get to know the campers and have the opportunity to keep in contact with some of them over their hockey seasons. Semenyna said he has even begun giving private lessons to some of the campers. ""When the kids get there … you always get excited to start the week off,"" Binnie said. ""You can kind of see how the kids progress throughout the five days that they're on the ice. They're on the ice a lot and they do improve a lot, and that's a rewarding thing."" Boettger also said that it was a very rewarding experience. Although he said it can be stressful for him at times, he has fun getting to go on the ice and coach the campers. ""When you're the organizer you don't always see the growth as far as the spiritual side of things because you're not with the campers as much,"" Boettger said. "" It's giving them an opportunity to seek it out a little bit more and in a context they enjoy. When they see other people, even guys that they look up to like Liberty hockey players, being part of that and sharing their stories."" Registration for LU-CHS is currently open and the Early Bird deadline is April 15. LU-CHS is also looking for 12-15 male student athletes to serve as counselors from any sport who have a heart for kids and for ministry.

S. Fed Cup team making back-to-back finals in 2009 and 2010.,"What lends weight to those championship appearances is the fact that they were done without the assistance of two of the greatest Americans to ever play, Venus and Serena Williams. Instead, the squads were comprised of players like Melanie Oudin, Vania King, Alexa Glatch, Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Liezel Huber.","But perhaps the most important member of those teams was captain Mary Joe Fernandez, who remains at the helm. The former world No. 4 and three-time Grand Slam finalist has thrived in the role, embracing not only the challenge of opposing other nations within the context of the event, but also fielding a team when the favorite options aren’t available.","The teams that she selects are often built with an eye toward the future of U. S. women’s tennis. The squad facing familiar foe Italy this weekend is made up of Christina McHale, Madison Keys, Lauren Davis and Alison Riske, all of whom are under the age of 25 with top-70 singles rankings.","It’s a very winnable tie as Italy is going without its stalwarts Sara Errani, Roberta Vinci, Flavia Pennetta and Francesca Schiavone. And, should the U. S. win on their home turf, it would do wonders for player development.","One of the most accomplished junior players in the history of the game, Fernandez personified the benefits of early development. Younger players today get fewer chances to experience playing in big situations, and doing so in a team environment with national pride on the line helps get them accustomed to playing in front of bigger crowds—both partisan and bipartisan—where nerves play a big role.","Professional sports organizations from the front office down to the players are often hesitant to be a part of rebuilding efforts. It’s a situation where Fernandez finds herself every year as Fed Cup captain. Still, she works with what’s in front of her, imparting her experience to the players and leading them to remarkable heights.","And one day, perhaps sooner than later, it will result in a Fed Cup title—a testament to Fernandez and the next generation of American women whom she has nurtured.",View the discussion thread.,Tennis View Magazine,© All Rights Reserved 2019 Tennis View MagazineSite by: Tampa Bay Web Services

Boston Sports Media Watch,"Hazel Mae anchors NESN’s nightly SportsDesk program and also serves as host of The Ultimate Red Sox Show, a weekly look back at the Red Sox, and The Buzz, another weekly show that is devoted to the Bruins.","Mae came to Boston from Toronto, where apparently they are still mourning her departure. Mae’s NESN Bio lists out some of her favorite things.","She’s been known to call into WEEI on occasion, and appears to enjoy teasing the guys, particularly Mike Adams and John Dennis.",———–,Automattician. View all posts by Bruce Allen,Love her!,LikeLike,Is it me or is her top half shrinking? The once “very” shapely Hazel seems to have lost her implant size. She still rocks my world and is a very good sports caster. I wish she would resume what Tina Cervasio did last year.,She’s easy on the ears as well as the eyes. Steve519,LikeLike,A double threat!!!Beautiful on the eyes!!! & into sports…Every guys dream!!!,LikeLike,Me too,LikeLike,hate her. her sex kitten shtick has got to go.,LikeLike,"Joan,","What’s your issue, its no stick its the way she is, she is awesome, she speaks sports well, has a command of everything she is speaking about, down to earth and very sensoual, you can’t make all that up its no “stick” its who she is",Sounds like you are jelous who cares if she is hot and sexy all the better,LikeLike,Would take Tappen over her.,LikeLike,"I remember seeing her on the NHL Center Ice package doing promos for Rogers Sportsnet before she came to NESN. I’m glad she came to New England. She has done a good job at the anchor desk. I know many women do not like her, but I like the job she does.",LikeLike,"Quick story on Hazel: A couple years ago at the Patriots Day Sox game, my buddy and I had standing room only tickets. By the fifth inning or so, we were tired of getting kicked out of the temporarily empty seats every half inning so we headed for the concourse area to watch the game on the TV. Of note, we were also about five sheets to the wind by then. Anyway, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted Hazel Mae walking by, being escorted by a coupled of roided NESN goons. After I pointed her out to my buddy, he screamed “HAZEL!!!!” at the top of his lungs. She stopped, looked over at us and, rather than walking quickly away from us bumbling rowdy drunks, she headed straight towards us and said “Hey guys, what’s going on?” Very friendly. The goons gave us one look-over and wisely guided her away from us. Nonetheless, I was impressed by her friendliness and willingness to engage us. In other words, her on-air persona wasn’t an act. I’ve liked her for that ever since. Thumbs up. HAZEL!!!!!",LikeLike,"You were impressed by her friendliness and willingness to engage you? That’s easy to do when, as you said, she’s “escorted by a coupled of roided NESN goons.”",She sells “sex appeal” so of course she’s going to enjoy getting some drunk guys to pant while protected by security.,My guess would be that if she was alone and two drunk guys yelled out to here she’d walk very quickly the other way… (not that I’d blame her),LikeLike,ha thats funny. i have a teacher thats mr. underwood. go figure. oh yeah go hazel!,LikeLike,Nice cans…Approve.,LikeLike,"Besides the fact that she never looks at the right camera, she is just AWFUL. And most of NESN is as well. She tells jokes that aren’t funny, stresses the wrong words in sentences, makes voice-overs sound like she’s giving us the impending news of the end of the world, and is HORRIBLE at reading highlights. Thankfully for her, NESN edits the SportsDesk show that airs in the morning and afternoon so they make her sound better.","Overall, if NESN canned her, Tappen, and Parker tomorrow I’d be totally ok with it.",LikeLike,I think Dave would prefer a shirtless Sean McDonough as SportsDeck anchor.,"I agree with Underwood–very genuine, friendly person. If I want to see serious, hard-hitting anchors, I’ll flip on Burton or Stearns. 🙂",LikeLike,I think they put on a quality show at NESN. She does a great job. Its nice to have some fine artwork to look at in the morning. Hazel Mae makes the show a little better.,LikeLike,"What I find most irritating about her is that she overuses cutesy phrases that I think she believes will get her a job at ESPN. Ellsbury is always “getting on his little pony,” Beckett had “two earnies” last night, there are “ducks on the pond,” etc. I think your comment that “she enjoys teasing the guys” exactly conveys the way she presents herself. She might be good – if she approached the job a little more professionally.",LikeLike,Bingo! It’s not a catch phrase contest or an ESPN tryout Hazel.,LikeLike,"This is a bit off topic, but I cannot stand Kathryn Tappen. I think she is awful! Hazel Mae is ok, nothing special. Tappen annoys the hell out of me.",LikeLike,"Her turns on WEEI are cringe inducing. The creepy, sexist banter she goes through with Mike Adams is disgusting.",LikeLike,Two Words:,MOTOR-BOAT!,LikeLike,"I like her. Met her at a Bruins game, very friendly. She does a very solid job on NESN. I like Kathryn Tappen, too. She looks great in HD! Jayme Parker’s gotta go.",LikeLike,"She said “…like Sister Christian, they’re motorin’…” twice in one highlight. That means she used the same catchphrase in the matter of two minutes. Is that even legal?",The other phrases of hers that just completely gnaws at me is when she describes a home run with “…two-run jobby…”,"Tappen’s worse. When Julian Tavarez re-signed with the Sox, she said, “He was seven-for-eleven last year with a 5.15 ERA.” Seven-for-eleven implies that he got seven hits in eleven at bats. He was, in fact, seven-AND-eleven.",They all suck.,LikeLike,"I find her incredibly annoying. Her delivery sounds like she has no idea what she’s talking about. And I heard the “Sister Christian” reference yesterday morning. Any time you have to *explain* a reference, it’s not worth using. She’s one step away from “…and like Night Ranger sang in their 1984 hit, ‘Sister Christian’…”","Her catch phrases and sayings clang like wrong notes, and her smarmy delivery has an undercurrent of “How-cool-and-funny-are-the-things-I’m saying?”","Just give me the scores, Hazel, or get to Bristol already.",LikeLike,"I always thought Hazel was cute until I got a high-def tv. When you have crystal-clear picture quality, it turns out her face isn’t that great. I think she seems to be somewhat knowledgeable about sports but is just annoying.",LikeLike,"Oh Lord, if I hear one more time about the throw coming to “the dish” I’m gonna puke…",LikeLike,"…. with the the recent influx of Playboy Bunnie caliber “anchors” Hazel is under intense pressure to keep her looks … K-Tap is taller and has more classic looks but even she pales to the recent bustier west coast acquisitions … I like Hazel but she is so annoying I have to change the station whenever she is on … Still shapely, Hazel’s a key fixture in Sean McGrail’s “master race” approach to Sportsdesk … Needs to wear low-cut tops to trump the modestly endowed K-Tap.",I approve because she is likeable and gives 100%.,LikeLike,I would rank the NESN women in this order:,1. Katheryn Tappen. Me likey. She’s just hot. I practically don’t even need to hear the words that come out of her mouth. They just don’t matter. 2. The departed Tina Cervasio. Sneaky hot with a hard body underneath the quasi-consevative dress. Oh yeah… she also gets points for being competent. 3. Hazel Mae. A little annoying but there is no denying the tremendous front court.,"Since this is supposed to be a Hazed thread, I give her the thumbs up. Large breasts = approve.",LikeLike,"Hazel is okay. Unfortunately I think her looks carry much more weight than her talent or skills. She does a pretty poor job reading highlights and I don’t think I’ve ever heard a sports anchor constantly use more tired cliches (at the dish, on the bump, three-run jack, etc.). If NESN really wants to go big time with their station and some of their productions they need to start by ramping up their SportsDesk program and upgrade several of the anchors, including Hazel",LikeLike,I think Hazel is FAN-TASTIC!… 2 thumbs up (among other things),LikeLike,I find Hazel very attractive. But I have a thing for Asian women anyway. 😉,"As for her on-air performance, when she first got here it seemed she was trying audition for ESPN, which annoyed me to no end. She’s toned it down since then and got much better.",LikeLike,She has fat calves. its gross. She wobbles up to the desk.,LikeLike,Ummm love her. http://www.hazelmae.net … so many good pictures & Videos,LikeLike,Real or fake?,"I think they’re fake. No problems with that, tho…",LikeLike,She tries way too hard to be a sex symbol. Most classy women don’t need to try too hard. And she also comes across as the type of woman who would date a rebel and then make him change until he’s painting her toe nails. She just isn’t sexy to me.,Tina Cervasio was more understated and oozed class. Tina was a much better reporter too.,LikeLike,"Just because one is beautiful doesn’t make her a good sports reporter. I have stopped watching SportsDesk because I cannot stand her. As other people have stated, she reads reports poorly (emphasizing wrong words, and so on), uses hokey cliche phrases, and has this annoying southern accent to make some points. She is even worse on live television; her work in the two rolling rallies was nothing short of pitiful. I love looking at beautiful women just like any other guy, but she totally sucks at NESN. She belongs on the E! network doing what Brooke Burke used to do, like hosting shows about nude beaches and naked parties, and leave sportscasting to the professionals.","I like Kathryn Tappen a lot. Jayme Parker was fine on SportsDesk, there was no need to replace her. Teetha Cervasio will always be a Yankee fan in my book and I don’t mind her leaving. But Hazel Mae is just plain terrible in her job. I wish NESN would can her immediately.",LikeLike,"Pretty sad that NESN and channel 7 has so little respect for Boston sportsfans that they throw these bimbos at us. I cant understand how any guys want this. There are plenty of places to see hot babes (Hazel is disgusting anyway, Tappen is hot) but it doesnt have to be on a sports broadcast. Give us someone who knows SOMETHING and then after the game I can hit the net for porn.",LikeLike,Hazels act is old. Really old. Her hair has been thinning and receding on camera. Her teeth are crooked and look like she sucks a vibrator while its still on. Her boobs are fake and she’s been to the hospital a couple times for leakage repairs. Hazel Mae knows that if she takes out her breast implants-her popularity and ratings go in the shitter. Her Bruins Buzz and Red Sox shows are awful!,Kathryn Tappen is okay. She wears too dark of a facial makeup on camera which clashes with her white neck. An orange golf ball on a white tee. In person Tappen looks anorexic skinny.,Weird that NESN is still searching for departed Red Sox field reporter Tina Cervasio’s replacement and the Sox season is underway. Red Sox owner Tom Werner (the owner who sounds like an flaming gay boy) who’s a big TV producer is overseeing NESN for his partners which the Red Sox own 80% of. The Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs owns the other 20%. Joel Feld is the dumbass running NESN for Henry-Lucchino and Werner.,LikeLike,sports+babes=very good!,What else do you hate? Hot weather chicks in tight tops?,You sir are UnAmerican!,LikeLike,Simplely the best in this town. Truely Professinal and a knock-out!!! Meet her a couple of times and she was great with my sons.,LikeLike,I like Hazel Mae but what the heck if she interviews anyone i’m just looking at her not listening to the interview. Tina Cervasio is my girl i wish she was back . Not taking anything away from Hazel Mae but i like the italian look .,LikeLike,"Hazel’s the best. Keep her in NESN. Don’t let her become a free agent. I can’t wait to get my DirecTV back, since I’ve been in Florida, I’m still waiting, so I can watch her and the Sox.",LikeLike,"Um, there’s even a song about it by The Boston Baseball Band.",Of course we approve,LikeLike,She’s the best! i met her in person! i love hazel,LikeLike,I love Hazel I wish she was on more!! In skimpier clothes,LikeLike,Wow.,"She’s not a great anchor, but she connected well with fans and brought a great attitude.",All the haters that critique her physique can go watch ESPN where only manly women can anchor.,LikeLike,Never cared for Hazel. Her entire personality seems like an act. I really want Jayme back in that role. I hope they give it to her.,LikeLike,Don’t go away Hazel!,"You’re the best, and will watch you every time!",LikeLike,"Please don’t go Hazel. Nobody can replace you. Say it say…PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.. Please stay just for me !!!!!!!!!",LikeLike,HAZEL DON’T GO! MY 70 YEAR OLD DAD WILL WITHER WITHOUT YOU! WE ALL THINK YOU ARE THE GREATEST IN MAINE. NO OTHER COULD TAKE YOUR PLACE!,LikeLike,Hazel was on Rogers SportsNet in Toronto until her affair wit hthe Toronto Maple Leafs GM became public and she came to Boston. She is a bit wacky on camera and that is her draw.,LikeLike,We don’t want you to go! Who ever will fill your shoes.,~The Wescott family from Maine,LikeLike,"Count me in the “bub-bye, Hazel (kiddie hand-wave)” camp. I don’t watch sports shows for the babes; I watch for the sports. Hazel’s incessant flow of obscure, sometimes ambiguous, and ALWAYS annoying euphemisms detract from her delivery. She uses them to make her appear to be one of the “in” people, but have the reverse effect of putting her out of touch with the viewers. On balance, she is an amateur competing with genuine professionals. I have never understood how she could have been given the anchor desk.","I like all of her colleagues at NESN better, but I have a little advice. First, don’t EVER again drop to her level, like Kathryn did in that hockey-puck, snack, sniping ad she did with Hazel; that’s a definite low point. Second; take elocution lessons. Stumbling over simple words and phrases can turn an attentive audience off.","Third; get to know the sports, teams, and individuals you cover. Tina Cervasio never seemed to care much about the Sox, but we got the sense that she spent some time studying them. TC seems on top of every team. Kathryn can hold her own on a Bruins panel of other local journalists. John Chandler crisply and clearly delivers the sports news, but you have the sense that he could be in any city. Jayme’s been here forever and handles all of the sports, both professional and school, with professionalism.",I hope that whoever lands the lead anchor desk position exhibits all of these qualities.,LikeLike,"Hazel is the best, I love how knowledgeable she is and she really enjoys covering sports. Keep up the great job Hazel.",LikeLike,"glad she isn't up here anymore. horrible at her job should not be a sportscaster but her ""personalities"" got her the job up here and down there i would imagine. good ridance. have fun sox nation",LikeLike,Comments are closed.

Apologies to Reduced Shakespeare Company for the headline.,"I went line-by-line through the NASL lawsuit and was intending to come back to anything that has yet to be covered in the Pro League Standards (story with PDF / standards sans PDF). After 3,000 words, I realized I was repeating myself. Or nit-picking. (In paragraph 16, the suit refers to “USFF,” and I quipped that this had nothing to do with U.S. Futsal.)",Let’s just hit the generalities:,This is a direct challenge of U.S. Soccer’s power to regulate pro soccer.,Paragraph 4: “The USSF is a private organization and has no legal authority to confer immunity from competition to anyone.”,"This is where we’ll find some of the interesting questions. Around the world, of course, the national federation governs the game in that nation, and that’s not disputed. You could argue that the FA has unfairly promoted the Premier League at the expense of other leagues, and I wonder if any lawyers in England have ever considered challenging the EPL’s money-making machine as a repression of “sporting merit.”","In the USA, the legal authority for U.S. Soccer comes from the Stevens Act, which poses some problems …","THIS is the big issue: USSF has argued Stevens Act (which largely involves Olympics) grants authority over pro game, as well. Dubious. https://t.co/ZeOgRzT9jb","— Steve Holroyd (@soccermavn) September 19, 2017","And, both implicitly and explicitly, the suit challenges FIFA.","Paragraph 57: “FIFA is a private international body that has assumed the role of organizing men’s and women’s soccer on a global basis. Its rules and regulations are privately derived and formulated, and do not have any governmental source of authority over professional soccer in the U.S.”","That’s a necessary challenge because FIFA expects the national federation to govern soccer in its country. In fact, it demanded that U.S. Soccer get moving on a Division I league as part of the deal to host World Cup 1994.","(In other words, if MLS didn’t exist, you might not have had a chance to see the World Cup, though I suppose only those of us over 30 — at least — actually had that chance. I wonder how this lawsuit will affect the next U.S. bid.)",I wonder if it’s theoretically impossible to meet Stevens Act and FIFA’s expectations at the same time.,Everything U.S. Soccer did to try to stabilize the lower divisions over the past 10 years is now being touted as “anticompetitive.”,"Here’s one reading of the U.S. Soccer’s decision to step into the rift within the USL, then operating in Division II and Division III: The Federation wanted to buy time for the two factions — neither of which had attained critical mass — to either work things out or solidify their own interests. So it agreed to take over and run an ad hoc Division II league for one year, during which the teams that would become the NASL managed to get their ships in relative order. The Federation also wrote stringent Division II standards that the NASL teams — but not the USL teams — could meet, all in the interest of trying to make sure teams wouldn’t fold midseason any more. (Yes, I hear you, disgruntled St. Louis Athletica fans.)","(And let’s be clear: The USL isn’t blameless here. The USL’s centralized model is the stumbling block to any possible merger between it and the NASL, NISA, NPSL, etc., and that is looking more and more like a liability at this point.)","Here’s the NASL lawsuit’s reading, repeated several times in the suit: The league was all set to go Division II and then Division I, but U.S. Soccer was in the way.","And the process of granting waivers to the Standards is deemed suspicious, even though that kept the NASL going at Division II for a few years.",Everything is part of a conspiracy.,The word “conspiracy” appears 31 times in the document.,"We’ve heard these arguments for years. MLS and the USSF want to monopolize soccer in the United States. I can’t imagine a country in which that’s not the case. Granted, you can get into the top tier through promotion/relegation in other countries, but the system is still set up so that you need vast amounts of capital to do so.","The USL, which got the same provisional Division II status as the NASL this year, is considered part of the conspiracy because it’s not interested in challenging MLS and cooperates with it, allowing MLS reserve teams to compete therein. But USL-MLS relations weren’t always so great, and the NASL was close to lining up the same partnership before abruptly backing away.",The NASL seems convinced MLS was terrified of it.,"Paragraph 10: “Driven in part by “concern[s] that the new NASL … would import players from South America and in essence become the anti-M.L.S. by allowing teams to sign players without worrying about a salary cap or a single-entity setup,” (citing a 2010 Bleacher Report piece) and thereby create a more attractive product for fans, the USSF has conspired with MLS and other USSF members to block the NASL from effectively competing with MLS.","As with a lot of things in Jeffrey Kessler’s lawsuits against U.S. Soccer, such as the time his side tried to convince the court that the “Premier League” and “First Division” were both “Division I” leagues in England, this is a more persuasive argument if you assume no one with any soccer knowledge will enter the courtroom. USSF lawyers will undoubtedly respond that MLS has signed plenty of players from South America and loosened its salary cap so that teams like Toronto can spend like the Sept. 23 Doomsday prediction is accurate.","Twice, the suit touts the NASL’s Open Cup record vs. MLS teams. But it’s a bit selective, spanning only the years 2012-14. THAT is when the NASL had a 42 percent win record against MLS, as claimed in the suit. And it doesn’t mention that the NASL has not yet had a team make the semifinals, much less win it. Most of those wins were against MLS reserves in the early rounds.","Also difficult to explain away from an NASL perspective: The USL, playing at a lower division, didn’t seem to have any problem staying competitive with the higher-tier NASL. If the USL could be competitive as a third-division league, why is Division II status so important to the NASL?",The NASL believes the Professional League Standards are unfair.,"I’ve questioned the divisional standards before. I don’t think a Division II league, for example, should be forced to operate in three time zones. Division I? Probably.","The suit adds a fun twist on the time-zone requirement, pointing out that top leagues in England, Germany, Spain, France and Italy have no such requirement. A look at a map should explain why.","Also, the suit complains that the USA’s standard of needing 15,000 seats in every Division I stadium would mean England’s Premier League is out of compliance. Bournemouth’s inability to renovate its stadium has far-reaching consequences, doesn’t it?","But it’s not as if the NASL is close to this requirement. Its median stadium capacity is 10,000.","Other countries have standards, too. In Germany, if you want to be in the top two tiers, you need a youth academy with a jacuzzi. To reach “Step 1” (the fifth division) in England, you have to be able to separate home and visiting fans in your ground.","Still, the suit raises a few legitimate objections. Why are Division I clubs required to have a “principal owner” with an Individual Net Worth of at least $40 million, when there’s a separate requirement for an ownership group to have a combined net worth of $70 million (to which the NASL apparently does not object) and a $1 million performance bond each season? Why did a 2015 proposal to raise the standards further — itself an ill-timed idea — propose that a Division I league must have 75% of its teams in metro areas of more than 2 million people, of which there are barely 30 in the USA?",Who made the Professional League Standards so stringent in the first place?,"Hat tip to BigSoccer’s Knave, who pointed out that some of the owners who split from the USL to form the NASL in the first place were pushing for tougher standards in 2010. Are any of those owners still involved?","On Jason Davis’ SiriusXM show today, Steven Bank noted that some “anticompetitive” standards may actually be procompetitive because they help clubs stay in business, which would be a change from lower divisions of the past.",But this is a recurring argument in the suit. There’s no other reason for the standards to be the way they are except to keep the NASL down. I’m not sure history backs up that claim.,"Hey, what about promotion/relegation?","Paragraph 11: U.S. Soccer doesn’t do pro/rel, so there.",Paragraph 12: NASL seeks to strike down all rules on divisions.,It’s a mixed message.,Paragraph 69 repeats the dubious claim that the FIFA statutes require divisional assignment primarily on sporting merit. We’ve covered this.,Antitrust depends on defining a market that is being claimed as exclusive territory by the defendant. What’s the market here?,Steven Bank addressed this issue this afternoon on Jason Davis’ SiriusXM show:,"""They could lose on market,"" – @ProfBank, citing the fact that MLS has so much competition on U.S. broadcasts (EPL, Liga MX, etc.)","— Beau Dure (@duresport) September 20, 2017",Steve Holroyd’s response:,"I think that works for *players*, but I'm not sure it's an obstacle when it comes to teams…teams can only play in US","— Steve Holroyd (@soccermavn) September 20, 2017",Why do I know so many legal people?,"The suit (Paragraph 35) actually says U.S. Soccer is restraining competition in the USA AND Canada, which may come as a surprise to the people launching a new league in Canada.",Is U.S. Soccer’s structure inherently flawed?,"MLS has 57.1% of the votes on the Pro Council, which means it can pretty much select the two representatives to the U.S. Soccer Board. (Though one of them now is actually Steve Malik of North Carolina FC, which is in the NASL (and NWSL) but perhaps not totally down with what’s happened this week, reports Neil Morris.)","Is that just the natural order of things, though? How many federations have multiple organizations like this? Even in U.S. Soccer, the Adult Council has one organization — the USASA, whose president, John Motta, will announce within 30 days whether he’s running for the U.S. Soccer presidency. (Breaking news, I suppose, but it’s been discussed on Twitter.)",Is U.S. Soccer obligated to have more than one Division I soccer league?,"No one else does, unless you count the oddball Indian Super League, which is a weird cross between a league and a tournament.","If so, is U.S. Soccer obligated to make that second league the NASL?","In Paragraph 198, U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati is quoted as saying in 2007 that he figured we would have two Division I leagues in a few years.","Let’s assume for sake of argument this isn’t ripped out of context (I haven’t had a chance to check). That would mean Gulati — and apparently U.S. Soccer, since the suit alleges he and his conspirators have near-omnipotent power over it — have no objection to having a second D1 league.",So why the objection to the NASL?,"Is it because the league muddled through under the guidance of since-disgraced Traffic Sports, among other troubles pointed out in an excellent overview by Soccer America’s Paul Kennedy?",Is it because the NASL brand name harkens back to the days of a popular but ill-managed league that broke every rule it could find?,"Is it because the league is down to eight existing teams, some of which have their eye on the door?","Is it because, as Kartik Krishnaiyer points out in a piece that doesn’t spare the Federation, the NASL “dug its own grave“?","Or is it because U.S. Soccer has come to realize a second Division I league would muddy the waters, poison relationships with sponsors and broadcasters and result in a replay of the “Soccer Wars” that killed the American Soccer League after its 1920s heyday?",,,,Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:,You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

"For many seniors, one of the largest struggles that comes with aging is a loss of independence. This can be seen in several different potential areas, from struggles with movement to issues with certain daily tasks, and one big area that often sees a sweeping change is driving.","At Legacy House in Southern Hills, our senior living program includes caregivers who understand how tough this loss of independence can be for many seniors. There comes an age when many people put away their keys and have to find other ways of getting around when they need to. If you’re a caregiver helping care for a senior loved one outside our assisted living facility, here are some tips we can offer on good alternative transportation options if you aren’t around to drive your loved one where they need to be.","Run by the National Center for Mobility Management, this is a fantastic online resource that allows residents in any state in the country to find volunteer transportation options. This is a robust list that often will provide several transportation programs near where your loved one lives. The state of Nevada, for instance, has 12 different individual volunteer programs providing rides and other transportation offerings to seniors and those who need them.","Modern technology has greatly benefitted the transportation area, namely in ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft. Many may think of these companies as primarily geared to younger generations, and this may even be true, but anyone with a smartphone can use this service and ridesharing companies are catering more and more to older adults these days. There are even simple services, such as GoGoGrandparent, that allow seniors who aren’t comfortable with a smartphone to book a ridesharing experience when they need one.","Within your locality, chances are there are at least a few general ride offerings out there provided by different healthcare organizations. Many hospitals, for instance, have vans and other vehicles available to help seniors or others with mobility issues get to and from their appointments more easily. These kinds of programs generally come at no cost to the user, or are built into their healthcare plans. Make sure you inquire about these.","Another area to look at, particularly if you live in a significant metropolitan area, is senior centers. These are generally located in many major counties, offering programs to help older adults who may not yet be in an assisted living facility, but can still use some help and stimulation from time to time.","One service these senior centers often provide is transportation, either themselves or through an outside agency. Once again, there’s a simple online resource available here to help you or your loved one find the closest senior center to you.","For more on senior transportation options when driving is no longer a possibility, or to learn about any of our senior living services, speak to the staff at Legacy House in Southern Hills today."

"OK, so it was not the amazing opener that the Masconomet Regional High School football team had hoped for. The Chieftains fell to Danvers, 28-14, on the road Friday, Sept. 7.It was all Danvers from the opening seconds when the Falcons returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown.Jay Theriault had more than 170 yards rushing for Masconomet and got the team on the scoreboard in the third quarter on a 7-yard dash into the end zone. He added a 1-yard TD run later, and Daniel McNamara converted the two-point rush.""It was frustrating,"" Masconomet coach Gavin Monagle told reporters after the game. ""I think experience caught up with us early. I think we showed some heart as the game went on. We started to get a little more confident with things, get the running game going a little bit there.

Nothing will keep us down.""Masconomet quarterback Marshall Lastes passed for 61 yards on two completions. Luke Tocci caught the bulk of those yards, a 55-yard reception, while McNamara had the other.Masconomet has not fared well in season-openers lately.

"– A couple of weeks ago, the Sooners extended an offer to Elite Corner Back Luke Hill out of Washington D.C., St Johns College High School.",Blessed to receive an offer from the University of Oklahoma #Sooners pic.twitter.com/IUuz3QAsUl,"— Luke Hill (@4flavorz) April 18, 2018",I was able to catch up with the 5’11” 170 lb. DMV area star to get some quick thoughts from about the offer.,"As you recall, Oklahoma Special Teams Coach Shane Beamer made his way through the DMV area and handed out several offers to some elite prospects, including one to Hill’s High School teammate Mekhail Sherman.","When I asked Luke what the OU offer meant to him, he said “That offer meant a lot to me. It showed me the level of competition I can compete on.” That say’s a lot about Oklahoma when you consider Hill also holds offers from South Carolina, Penn State and Virginia Tech among others.","Being from the east coast, I asked Hill what his perception of the Oklahoma football program was, and he replied “When I hear the words ‘Oklahoma Football’ I think of diversity. My perception of the program is top notch, best of the best in both talent and facilities”","As we were wrapping up the conversation, Luke mentioned, “I see myself getting out to Norman during the summer for a visit.”","I am in the process of setting up a time to do a “Spotlight” piece on the elite Defensive Back in the near future, and I will be sure to keep you all updated on the plans for the visit and follow up with Luke at that time. – (Charlie)",,,"– Oklahoma is looking to land two running backs in the 2019 class. Late last night 2019 Millwood (OKC) RB, Marcus Major Jr, cut his list down to seven with OU making the cut.","1st I want 2 thank God for da talents & gifts that he has given me 2 play this game I love. 2nd I want to thank my parents & coaches for everything they have done 4 me during this process. Last I want 2 thank every coach that has offered me a scholarship, But I’m cutting it to 7. pic.twitter.com/tRL67u5rpM","— MDMJ…$5￼ (@Md24jr) May 5, 2018","We have written extensively about the OKpreps star and noted that OU was the lone school that has yet to offer his teammate, 2019 WR Demaryion Houston, and the possible effects that could come with that. So far Oklahoma has recruited Major well enough to stay in the race.",Major’s father has continued to tell TFB that the decision will come at the end of July or early August. They would like to have the recruiting done and focus solely on Major’s senior year at Millwood.,"All that said, expect some official visits to begin happening with Major and Oklahoma to get one of those officials sometime this summer. As we get the dates of the officials will pass them along. – (Brandon)",,,Round Ball Round-Up:,Oklahoma has been getting in on a ton of grad transfers this spring after the departures of three players directly after the end of the 2017-2018 basketball season.,"Oklahoma is hosting 2018 point guard Franco Miller Jr this weekend on an official visit. I spoke to a source about Miller and was told that they would take his commitment if he decided to do so, but that if they do it would “end the option of taking Wichita State star transfer shooting guard, Austin Reaves, and Reaves is the hottest transfer there is on the market right now.","Reaves visited Oklahoma and Northern Iowa a couple of weeks ago and up until recently Oklahoma felt like they were going to land the star Shooting Guard. Source told me that once they heard Reaves was now considering Michigan and Indiana, the Sooners staff decided to offer Miller. That offer went out on April 26th.","The Sooners staff really like Miller. Miller is down to Oregon, Ole Miss, Minnesota and Oklahoma so it’s not like it would be big step down from Reaves, but as a source told me, “Oklahoma would love to have Reaves sit a year and then play the 2019 season because the depth, experience, and 2019 class could add up to something special that season.”","If Miller doesn’t commit, expect OU to really push Reaves to pull the trigger in hopes that visits to Michigan and Indiana don’t happen. Reaves originally hails from Arkansas, so Oklahoma is hoping that location wins out with him.","Either way, Oklahoma has really set themselves up nicely with some top tier grad transfers and recruiting after what looked like a very rough 2018 season after McGusty and Shepherd announced their transfer intensions.",We will follow and update any info we hear on Miller’s official visit this weekend. – (Brandon),,,2019 Defensive Line Recruiting:,“The game is won in the trenches”…you have heard that saying a million times before.,"As Sooner fans, you need to look no further than the program’s two appearances in the College Football Playoff over the last three years to realize the validity of that mantra.","In both playoff games, the Sooners won the battle on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball well enough to be in position at halftime to win the game. After halftime… not so much.","In 2015, against Clemson, the Sooners held a 17-16 lead at the half. The second half was an unmitigated disaster, on BOTH sides of the ball, with Clemson cranking out 21 unanswered points enroute to a 37-17 victory. OU was blown off the ball on both sides in the second half of that game.","Fast forward to 2017 in the Rose Bowl, an instant classic; nonetheless, another heartbreaking loss where the game was won in the trenches. While some of you will place the blame for the loss on some seemingly questionable play calling and gimmicks (ugh that squib kick), if you look at the big picture, the game was won in the trenches as the Georgia offensive line dominated the Oklahoma defensive line (front seven really) in the second half. The Bulldogs scored 37 in the second half and over time points. Many of those points came on long runs through three-lane-highway sized gaping holes.","Those are just the two most prominent examples of games being lost in the trenches for Sooner fans. Look a little deeper at the 16 losses the program has suffered since the end of the 2011 season, and most can be traced directly to the play in the trenches. While the Sooners have had little challenge in the conference, in part based on the style of play, the speed bumps they have encountered can usually be traced back to losing in the trenches.","While there has been ample evidence that the Sooner offensive line more than holds its own and continues to be a strength for the most part, since 2012, the defensive line has been a lot more unreliable.","However, that may be changing sooner, rather than later. Improved Defensive line recruiting has been a priority for the Sooners, particularly over the past 3 years. I believe that it is no coincidence that the defensive line recruiting has picked up significantly based on one fact: the 2018 season will be Coach Thibodeaux’s third year as DL coach. From 2012 to 2016, the Sooners employed 4 different DL coaches in that five year span. Jackie Shipp, Jerry Montgomery, Diron Reynolds, and finally Calvin Thibodeaux. There was absolutely no consistency to build any momentum on the recruiting trail.","That all changed last year when #ST2K18 brought in a truly elite defensive line class, one of the top position classes in the country in my opinion. Ron Tatum, Ronnie Perkins, Michael Thompson, Jordan Kelley, and Jalen Redmond each have the potential to be All-Americans in their playing careers should they remain healthy and reach their full potential.","That class is a far cry from the 2016 class which signed Amani Bledsoe and Mark Jackson (who is truly an “Edge” guy). However, the 2017 class does not get enough credit. OU brought in a very solid class (the best class in the Big 12 that cycle in my opinion) with Tyreece Lott, Zach McKinney, Troy James, Isaiah Thomas, Dillon Faamatau, and K’Jakyre Daley. That is a group of guys who may not be household names at this point, but they all will serve as a solid foundation for the Sooners defensive line in the coming years.","That brings us to the 2019 class. The Sooners already have two big “Plan A” targets committed in Derek Green and Kori Roberson. While those two may not get the “love” from the recruiting services at this point, they were absolutely two of the staff’s top targets from day one. When it comes to recruiting the Defensive Line, as Super K has mentioned before, the Sooners are looking for a certain body type more than a specific position type. They want to be bringing in guys who can play multiple positions along the line, both inside and outside, so it is not easy to get a feel for the position number breakdown; however, I am going to say that OU has found their man in the middle for this class in Derek Green and the rest of the players they recruit will be in that “multiple” mold.","Sources have indicated that the staff would like to bring in a total of four defensive linemen, with some wiggle room to go up to five players if the “right” guy should be interested.","The Focus: Based on what we are hearing, the players listed below represent the preferred class","Kori Roberson | 6’3” 275 lbs. | SDE | Manvel (TX) Manvel | OU Commit | The Sooners got in early on the big bodied and heavy handed Dl and that turned out to be a very wise decsion as he has picked up some really nice offers including one from Bama last week. He is a gifted athlete with a high end motor who will challenge for playing time immediately when he gets on campus. All signs indicate that he is completely locked in with OU, but the staff, and in particular Coach Thibodeaux, will be sure to stay on top of him and continue to build that relationship.",Derek Green | 6’5” 290 lbs. | DT | Jacksonville (NC) Southwest | OU Commit | Green committed early – decommitted – and recommitted to the Sooners at the Spring game. His relationship with Ruffin McNeil played a massive role in settling once and for all with the Sooners. He will be a force in the middle for the Sooners.,Marcus Hicks | 6’5” 235 lbs. | WDE | Wichita (KS) Northwest | Hicks has been to Norman on many occasions and the staff continues to build a great relationship with both Marcus and his family. He is a player OU has targeted from day one.,"Marcus Stripling | 6’3” 265 lbs. | SDE | Houston (TX) Mayde Creek | Stripling was at one time silently committed to OU. It depends who you talk to and what day you talk to them on in regards to how OU stands with Stripling at this point. What I can say is that it would not be the least bit surprising to see Marcus make his way up to Norman for an unofficial at some point this summer, I would actually expect that to happen. As I mentioned last week, as of right now it appears that Texas A&M has the upper hand; however, they have yet to play a game under Jimbo Fisher, and things could get sideways really early in College Station, which would further open the door for OU.",In Play: Players that OU really likes and feel that they would fit well in their system,"Kayvon Thibodeaux | 6’5” 235 lbs. | WDE | Thousand Oaks (CA) Oaks Christian | The number one player in the country according to more than a few people has talked about OU on and off for the better part of his recruitment. Brandon has mentioned the possibility of an official visit to Norman and I have picked up word of that possibility as well recently, so we will see if that comes to fruition. Everyone in the country is vying for his services and if the OU staff can get him to Norman, you never know what can come of it.","Braylen Ingraham | 6’4” 260 lbs. | SDE | Fort Lauderdale (FL) St. Thomas Aquinas | Ingraham visited Norman for the spring game weekend, It was one of the quietest vists in recent memory however it appears to have been a very effective visit based on Braylen not being too shy about having OU in his top two, along with home state school Miami. I can tell you that OU continues to put in a lot of work here as Coach Mike Stoops has visited him several times since the Spring Game visit.","Faatui Tuitele | 6’4” 299 lbs. | DT | Honolulu (HI) St Louis | Tuitele visited Norman, along with Austin and Baton Rouge, on his tour of the middle of the country back in March. The family had glowing reviews of their time spent on campus and there is a possibility of a return visit for an official. The DT holds offers from every major program in the country and should OU get an official, you have to think they have made a serious impression and absolutely have a chance here.","Trace Ford | 6’4” 225 lbs. | SDE | Edmond (OK) Santa Fe | Ford has been killing it in camps recently. While he is yet to hold an OU offer, should that offer come, the Sooners would immediately become a real contender. Will there be lingering hard feelings based on the timing of that offer? That is yet to be known fully but I am led to believe that the Sooners have been completely upfront with the young man about the reasoning behind the lack of an offer to this point and that has to do with how they are feeling in regards to other targets they have already offered.","The one thing that jumps out to me about those players mentioned above is their size. They are all over 6’3″ and have tremendous length for the most part. Each of them can play multiple positions along the defensive line which is exactly the type of body/player the Sooners are looking for. Much like the way Coach Bedenbaugh has been recruiting for the offensive line and the way we are seeing Coach Cooks recruit for the secondary, Coach Thibbs and Coach Ruffin are seeking those elite athletes who they can plug in at different spots in order to get the best players on the field at the same time.","As things stand right now in regards to recruiting for 2019, we like where OU stands with their commits, Roberson and Green, as well as where they stand with Marcus Hicks. As for Marcus Striping, that one will take some time to be finalized no matter if he commits to one program or the other. Ingraham is really high on Oklahoma. However, Miami will be in the picture to the very end, so it will be a battle till sigining day. As for Fuitele and Thibodeaux, OU would be incredibly happy to get them on campus for an official should that take place, and then take their best shot. Ford is the one I am really keeping an eye on. He may be developing into a player that OU just can’t afford to not offer, right before our eyes. My question there will be, will it be too late?",What a difference 3 years makes in the recruiting world. – (Charlie)
Copyright © 2019 These Football Times,"WHEN YOU THINK OF THE FINEST LA LIGA STRIKERS over the past 20 years, you would include the Real Madrid trio of Raúl, Ronaldo and Morientes. Then Kluivert, Eto’o and Suárez from Barcelona. A few others would certainly make the grade – Diego Tristán of Deportivo and David Villa. However, aside from the obvious El Clásico duopoly, Atlético Madrid have been especially blessed in this department over this period.","Torres, Forlán and Agüero; Falcao, Diego Costa and Griezmann: it’s a constant conveyor belt of acceleration, dynamism and goals. It has become a massive part of the club’s DNA – something that they are now known for. All of these strikers could make a serious claim to be among the best in the world at some point in time during their Atlético years. So what is it about the smaller, less glamorous of the two Madrid clubs that let their forwards succeed so often?","It is a club that has always had a strong South American connection; from Rubén Ayala in the 1970s, to Maxi Rodríguez in the mid-2000s, to with Luis Perea, the defender who amassed the most appearances for the club as a non-Spanish player from 2004 to 2012. There was also Diego Simeone. His first spell with the club was from 1994 until 1997. In 1996 he was part of the team that achieved the La Liga and Copa del Rey double. He then returned from success in Italy to play with Atlético from 2003 to 2005. In his last two years there he saw the rise of prominent young striker, Fernando Torres.","El Niño is one of Atleti’s favourite sons. He worked his way up through the youth ranks of the club and made his debut in Spain Segunda División in 2001. A week later, he opened his goalscoring account with a late back-post header against Albacete. He then continued to play the starring role in an often-struggling team, captaining them by the age of 19.",Many were hoping Torres’ top performances as a strong yet agile striker with a lethal early finish would propel him to be Spain’s next great striker after Raúl. He kept improving and impressed many with his link-up play and ability to play up front alone. He was also catching the eye at international tournaments – a shining light in the midst of Spain’s disappointing Euro 2004 campaign.,Read | Fernando Torres and the cyclical journey of a cult hero,"Torres was only used as an impact sub in the first two games against Russia and Greece, before ousting an in-form Fernando Morientes in the group decider against Iberian rivals Portugal. Two years later in Germany, he netted three goals at the 2006 World Cup. Already on the radar of every big club, unfortunately for the red, white and blue half of Madrid, it seemed only a matter of time before he moved on. Finally, in July 2007, after regular summer flirtations with the Premier League, Rafael Benítez sealed the Spaniard’s signature for Liverpool. Torres completed a £20 million move to Merseyside and went on to form a telepathic relationship with Steven Gerrard.","The pragmatism of the board at the Vicente Calderón was evident to see in the way they handled Torres’ departure. The summer before, in 2006, they started laying the foundations for the likelihood of their star man moving on. They signed a 19-year-old striker from Independiente, who many described as the new Romário – one Sergio Agüero. Then, when Torres finally was sold, they secured Diego Forlán’s signature. The player, who struggled at Old Trafford for three years, went on to win the Pichichi on Spain’s east coast with Villarreal, forming an era-defining partnership for the club with Juan Román Riquelme.","Forlán and Agüero’s partnership worked perfectly. The Argentine was young and had a lot to learn about the European game, and who better to teach him than a fellow Spanish-speaking South American who’d had his fair share of difficulties with adapting on the continent. It was brilliant planning by the Rojiblancos board.","In 2007, Diego Forlán was fast becoming one of the most feared strikers in Europe. He displayed dynamism all around the penalty area with a habitual ability to score from long range with both feet. At their peak, Forlán and Agüero wreaked havoc for defences in La Liga and the UEFA Cup. One of their best displays as a partnership was in the 4-2 demolition of Barcelona at the Vicente Calderón in March 2008.","Forlán was the perfect foil for Agüero’s unpredictability and burst of acceleration as the Argentine struck two and set up one. During the following season, Pep Guardiola’s first in charge at the Camp Nou, Atlético once again beat La Blaugrana. This time a 4-3 win, Forlán and Agüero were again mesmerising, each netting twice. Forlán’s first goal, in particular, was one of real quality.",Read | How Diego Forlán gave hope to late bloomers everywhere,"He received the ball midway inside Barça’s half and, with Carles Puyol and the rest of the defence back-peddling, he unleashed an outward curling shot with his left foot. The ball looped past Victor Valdés’ right side and into the top corner as the deep nets of the Calderón bulged. In their four years together they amassed 142 goals for Atlético, as well as proving instrumental in bringing Champions League football back to the club after 11 years. They were also the standout performers in Atlético’s UEFA Cup triumph of 2010.","The tide changed in 2011 as Agüero joined the revolution at Manchester City and Diego Forlán moved to a declining Internazionale. This paved the way for Colombian Radamel Falcao to join from Porto, joining one Diego Costa who had been re-signed to the club after a promising season at Rayo Valladolid.","In only two seasons at Atlético, Falcao’s reputation grew ten-fold. His change of direction in the box and the ability score with finesse or force made him the best poacher in Europe. He was yet another player who scored a remarkable goal against Barcelona for Los Rojiblancos. This time, however, it was at the Camp Nou.","Lionel Messi was dispossessed in Atlético’s half by Diego Costa, who swiftly moved the ball to an advancing Falcao. The Colombian swept past Sergio Busquets with the outside of his right boot and proceeded with a blistering curved run towards goal, with Barcelona’s high line trickling behind. With the goal ahead, he opted for a nonchalant chip over the top of Valdés to score the best visiting goal at the Camp Nou that season. The way in which he married unpredictability with a delicate finish was spectacular; it was a goal that summed up Falcao at the time perfectly.","The lure of bigger wages and more glamorous surroundings dictated Falcao’s move to the province of Monte Carlo by joining Monaco in 2013. However, the wheels kept turning for the conveyor belt of forwards at Atlético. This time Diego Costa, who first joined the club’s ranks in 2007, stepped forward. The addition of an ageing David Villa was certainly a help, but it was Costa who grabbed – sometimes literally – La Liga by the scruff of the neck in the 2013/14 season with his 27 league goals leading them to the title. Under the guidance of Simeone, Atletico became a club that finally realised it’s staggering potential.","Read | In defence of Diego Costa, the master of war","Costa’s introduction to English football was in the Champions League semi-final first leg between Atlético and Chelsea. With seven minutes on the clock, a throw-in from the right-hand side reached the Brazil-born striker as John Terry came in from behind with a firm clearance. Costa immediately turned around and barged the defender’s chest. However, this wasn’t just any defender – this was John Terry, the last of his kind. It didn’t matter to Costa. It was a signal to José Mourinho’s Chelsea that even though they might be playing the underdogs, it would not be an easy passage to the final.","This proved to be true as the game ended 0-0. In the second leg, Costa was instrumental, scoring one and inadvertently assisting another. It solidified Mourinho’s thoughts about Costa being the missing piece to his Chelsea jigsaw. When he moved to Chelsea that summer, one would assume the striking prowess at the club might cool off, and it might have been the case had it not been for Antoine Griezmann, now amongst the world’s most feared and in-demand players.","So why do Atlético’s strikers flourish? One of the common denominators over this period has been the South American connection. At a club like Atletico, where the freedom to play your game and fire from within is cherished, they have been given the chance to adapt to the European game in front of loyal, passionate supporters. The managers have also played a strong part; from Luis Aragonés and Javier Aguirre to Quique Sánchez Flores and Simeone, they have all been adept at protecting their strikers, giving them the confidence to play their natural game, and setting up their teams to be solid behind them.","Tactically, Atlético have also been an anomaly at the top end of the game. Unlike most other sides they’ve played two up front for much of this period, giving strikers a chance to build partnerships and work together. Instead of one man roaming alone – like Torres did for much of his first spell at the club – managers since have stuck to the trusted two-man strikeforce, and never was that better seen than in the days of Forlán and Agüero. Additionally, the counter-attacking style of play, particularly away from home, has benefitted their forwards in this period, many of whom like to burst into space and stretch the defence. The way Costa bullied defenders and ran in behind the was the perfect example for Atlético in 2013/14.","Every club has a unique identity in football. Indeed, it has now become such an integral facet of the globalisation of the sport – a unique selling point. It could be the Galácticos of Real Madrid, the tiki-taka of Barcelona or the Total Football of Ajax. For Atletico Madrid, it’s their unforgiving style of play under Diego Simeone, one which marries defensive stability with world-class strikers, given the freedom to express themselves within the remit of the team’s tactical plan. This has enabled the club to build a reputation as the foremost hotbed of striking talent in Europe.",By Ruairí Grego,Comments are closed,,RECLAIMING THE FOOTBALL YOU THOUGHT WAS LOST

"Liam Neeson went on Sportscenter to promote Taken 2 yesterday (2aken? Twoken?), and because ESPN is largely run by loudmouthed blowhards whose only identifiable skill is being able to emit long strings of unbroken shouting without pausing to think about the words being said, anchor Mike Hill opened with what he thought was a softball question for Neeson, “Can you even act like the Jets are good this year?”","You know, the usual meaningless semantic provocation used by ESPN talking heads to stimulate shouty discussion without resorting to any pesky facts. Unfortunately for them, Liam Neeson, despite living in New York, is an Irishman, and folks across the pond generally know about as much about American football as you or I know about hurling.

,British Columbian teens playing rugby isn’t an unusual thing. Even people with just a passing notion of the game know it’s a big sport in B.C. high schools.,But Victoria’s Quinn Ngawati is still unusual.,"Yes, he’s a rugby player, but the kind of rugby he’s playing, and the place he’s doing it, aren’t all that common for Canadian players, especially not ones as young as him.","The 17 year old St. Michaels University School student is one of a group of 18 recruits from the U.S., Canada and Jamaica trying to make Canada’s newest professional rugby squad: English rugby league’s Toronto Wolfpack. At 6’4″ and already over 200 lbs., you can see why he’s an enticing athlete just on paper — and then there’s his real-life athleticism.","The expansion team, which is in training camp now and will hit the field for real in March, plays the 13-a-side version of rugby. Canadians are more accustomed to the 15-a-side (or sometimes 7-a-side) rugby union.","For the last three weeks, in the damp and fog of north England, Toronto Wolfpack coach Paul Rowley and his staff have been building a dream.",Assembling a professional rugby league team from the ground up.,"“It’s interesting because it’s so different than anything anybody’s ever done before — putting a whole team together from scratch with nothing. Nothing in terms of facilities, nothing in terms of one lad knowing another,” said the former England hooker. “It’s all so new.",“It’s humbling really … It brings you back to when you began playing the sport and why you did and the beauty of it and the love for it. Everyone’s training with a smile on their face but ultimately we’re working hard because we’ve got some goals to achieve.”,"Despite the challenges, there have been no bad moments thanks to the enthusiasm of the group, he says.","“Good moments and bite-your-lips moments,” he said.","The Wolfpack, owned by a group of entrepreneurs including Australian David Argyle, are serious about making their transatlantic sports venture work. Playing in the Kingstone Press League 1 — the third tier of professional rugby league in England — they will pay the travel expenses of European teams coming to Canada during the season. The first home game at Toronto’s Lamport Stadium isn’t until May, the seventh league game of the season.","Ngawati and his rivals have now flown over to the U.K., joining the 24 experienced players already in camp. They have 12 days to show their mettle, and there are no guarantees: Rowley, who will carry 25 to 30 players during the season with 17 dressing for games, says none of the North Americans may make the first team.","The group of 18 will feature in a TV documentary series called The Last Tackle, set to air on North American screens in 2017.","“Being half Kiwi, Rugby and rugby league is just part of who we are,” he explained Wednesday via email. “I started playing at the age of seven and am still playing for my local club, Velox Westshore in Victoria.”",Quinn Ngawati,A tip from his Canada U17 rugby league coach Andy Blackburn connected him with his Wolfpack chance.,"“He has taught me a lot about the game,” Ngawati said. “His top concern is always for the players and helping them fulfilling their goals.”","Ngawati’s other rugby inspiration comes from his father, who is of Maori descent and a former rugby league player.","“I am half Maori and am very proud and connected with that part of my culture and heritage,” he said. “New Zealand kids usually grow up around touch, and then move into rugby league or union as they grow up. My father was a league player and is very passionate about the game. I have grown up watching the (Australian) NRL since I was a young boy, it is just a part of our household.”","Blackburn said Ngawati isn’t just a highly talented athlete — he counts basketball, rowing, roller hockey, swimming and triathlon as other sports he’s given a go — he’s also supremely focused.","“What sets him apart is his attention to details,” the coach said. “He has a routine 48 hours from a match that he never deviates from.”",“I haven’t seen that in anyone else.”,"Blackburn recalled a team visit during an August training camp — they played against Jamaica — to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. There’s a interactive goalie game, where you can play goalie against simulated NHL shooters.","“Most kids just jump in and have a go, but Quinn was methodical,” he said. The other boys kept encouraging Ngawati to have a go, but he kept saying, “not yet,” Blackburn said. “He was studying where the shots were likely to come from; when he finally gave the game a go, he got a high score.”",Ngawati puts up a shot against Collingwood during the 2016 Boys ‘AA’ High School Basketball Championships last March.,"He’s also still keen to have a go at rugby union, the game he’s played the most.","“Having the chance to play for my country has always been a goal and I have recently been lucky enough to be selected to the Canada U19 rugby union team, so I’m still very involved with that pathway,” he said.","He spent his grade 10 year in New Zealand, where he attended famed rugby school Hamilton Boys High. It raised his understanding of the game to a new level: “My rugby during this time improved dramatically, due to the coaches, the level of play, the rugby culture, and the hard work required to compete on the teams I was lucky enough to be a part of.” He was selected for the Waikato U16 provincial team while he was there.","“At this point in time I have found rugby league to be a style of rugby that fits me better and I am excited to see where this opportunity will take me,” he said, reflecting on all the high level rugby he’s been exposed to. “Each of these experiences is a great opportunity to develop my game, and I am very thankful to have played on each of these teams.”",— with files from The Canadian Press,pjohnston@postmedia.com,twitter.com/risingaction,facebook.com/tryandtackle,"365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com",© 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS.,X,Trending:,By Ricardo Cano | CALmatters,"If the Golden State has a rooting interest in the Super Bowl on Sunday, it won’t just be because the Los Angeles Rams will be on the field. Roughly one player in six on the Rams’ and New England Patriots’ active rosters is a product of California high schools. Year after year, California has churned out top-tier recruits who go on to play football in college and then the NFL.","But the state that produced Tom Brady, Jared Goff and Julian Edelman is also in the thick of national trends that are fueling a decline in football participation, largely because of concerns over head injuries and competition from less aggressive sports.","Even parts of the state known to be football powerhouses have experienced significant declines in high-school football participation, a CALmatters analysis of statewide data shows.","Figures from the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports in California, and the National Federation of State High School Associations have shown consistent decreases in the number of high-school students in California turning out for tackle football over the past decade.","In an effort to gain an apples-to-apples comparison of where and how football programs across the state have been impacted by participation declines, CALmatters analyzed data for nearly 800 public and private high schools that submitted 11-player football participation figures to the state in the 2011-12 and 2017-18 school years.","Because not all schools submitted data for both years, and because some programs switched to 8-player football, not every school is represented, but the data do cover most of the 877 high schools tallied by state and national censuses in 2017-18.","In this time span these 800 or so schools — large, small and spread throughout California’s ten CIF “sections,” or regions — saw a nearly 11 percent decline in football participation overall, from about 81,500 participants in 2011 to 72,600 students in 2017.",,"Those figures more or less concur with estimates by the state governing organization, which reported an approximate 13 percent statewide decline in football over the past decade. Across the country, participation has gone down roughly 5 percent since 2011, the national association reports.","The drop in California has been steeper in some parts of the state than in others, the analysis found. The CIF’s small Oakland Section, for instance, has actually gained players. And in the Central Valley, the decline has scarcely registered. The CIF Central Section, home to historically competitive football regions in Fresno and Bakersfield, saw almost no drop in participation. The 83 schools in the region that submitted data for both years collectively lost about 100 boys’ athletes, or a decline of about 1 percent.",But in the massive CIF Southern Section—a cohort of hundreds of schools including nationally known programs and spanning most of the counties in Southern California—roughly one player in seven over the last six years has dropped off the roster.,"The data show growth in participation in only a fraction of schools and only a couple of regions. Only about 50 of the nearly 800 schools included in CALmatters’ analysis gained 30 or more football players between 2011 and 2017. But 168 football programs showed losses of 30 players or more. In the most extreme examples, the decline essentially halved some schools’ rosters:",,"So far, the decline hasn’t jeopardized California’s standing as a dominant pipeline for collegiate and professional football. Only a fraction of high school players ever get recruited to play in college, let alone the pros. And football still is the most popular boy’s sport in California, which is the nation’s most populous state.","However, it comes amid a tense and highly publicized debate in the state over the safety of the sport, with legislators last year unsuccessfully pushing a bill last year to ban youth tackle football for children under age 12. Though the authors of that bill appear to have backed off this year, new legislation backed by youth football advocates would limit contact time for youth programs.","Roger Pielke Jr., director at the Sports Governance Center at University of Colorado, said that while “football is in a relatively healthy condition,” the numbers in California and nationally point to signs that “we in the United States are past peak football.”","“It’s undeniable at this point that there’s been a decline in this sport,” Pielke said, adding that youth and high school participation indicate “at a minimum, a slow attrition.”","The declines have had a pronounced impact on some programs, including Healdsburg High School in Sonoma County, which made headlines last year when the varsity team cancelled its season due to low numbers.","“We do not consider them quitters at all,” Principal Bill Halliday told CALmatters in September, adding that in Healdsburg, “Friday night lights is very much a big part of the community.”","But having only 18 players to field meant that many kids had to play offense, defense and special teams throughout entire games. After the second game of the season, players met and voted whether to continue—a particularly heartbreaking choice for seniors in their final season.","“Their parents could feel the pain of their sons, and it pains them,” Halliday said. “It was not easy for anybody.” But, he added, “We think that they very much made a decision and perceived correctly that the situation wasn’t sustainable,” Halliday said.","The state’s participation data also indicate some schools in recent years switched from 11-player to 8-player football programs, which still involve full contact but with smaller teams.","Weed High School, about 70 miles north of Redding, was among the programs that made the switch, in part because of low participation and declining enrollment that allowed it to meet the state’s threshold for 8-player schools, said Steve Neel, the school’s athletic director.","Weed’s programs fielded 28 boys for 11-player football in 2011, according to state data, and had gone down to 18 players by 2017, when the Weed Cougars competed in an 8-player league.","“We just really felt for us to compete and for the safety of our kids that it was important to move 8-man,” Neel said.","The switch paid off, Neel said. The school was more competitive in an 8-player league and there were fewer injuries. In past years, the school had to fold teams because of low numbers.","Weed will again play in an 11-player league this fall in part because of a student enrollment hike that bumps it out of 8-player eligibility, Neel said, though the varsity roster is projected to field only 13 players. But at least, he added, the school still has a program.","“I thought we might in some respects have a chance to lose football at Weed High School,” Neel said.","And football lovers have gotten creative on other fronts. Last year, Democratic Assemblymembers Kevin McCarty of Sacramento and Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego introduced Assembly Bill 2801, which would have barred students from playing tackle football until high school.","Believing the legislation went too far, youth football supporters formed a grassroots coalition, called the California Youth Football Alliance, and mounted a successful social media campaign to oppose the bill. Eventually AB 2108 was pulled by McCarty and Gonzalez before being heard in a committee.","This year, a representative for Gonzalez said the assemblywoman had no plans to introduce similar legislation, and McCarty said this week that he is “exploring the issue once again, but no definitive answer yet.”","Meanwhile, Assemblyman Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Elk Grove, introduced AB 1 this session, which would limit youth football programs to two full-contact practices per week at a cap of 60 minutes per day, as well as ban full-contact during the offseason. Those regulations are similar to recent ones the state enacted on high schools.","“The California Youth Football Alliance came to me, they understand there are risks with playing football, and they asked that it be regulated.” Cooper said. “They want to make sure it’s safe for their children.”",Cooper said the bill represents a “good medium” for making the sport safer for the state’s youngest students. “It doesn’t have to be either or.”,"Still, the trend is what it is, with or without legislation, said McCarty.","“Every month, another study surfaces outlining the risks of youth tackle football. Every month, another NFL legend speaks up and questions the wisdom of youth tackle football,” he noted.","“But more importantly, parents see the risks and are voting with their feet.”",,,Get the latest news delivered daily!

The duo were answering questions at City's fans' forum,Jordan Moore-Taylor and Paul Tisdale both believe that Exeter City is the premier club in the South West for youngsters to join.,"The duo answered a question during last night’s fans’ forum at City over the standard of young players coming through from the academy at the moment, with Ethan Ampadu and Ollie Watkins hitting the headlines last year and Jack Sparkes seemingly next on the conveyer belt of talent at the Grecians.","Moore-Taylor says the dynamic of clubs has changed from when he was a youngster, when Plymouth Argyle were the club of choice to join, and believes the standard is higher than when he was coming through the youth ranks.",Read below to see their full answers to the question.,"Jordan Moore-Taylor: Well they’re better than I was! I think every year the lads coming through get better and better, that’s a credit to the club and the players they manage to attract. When I first started off at the club as a nine-year-old, Plymouth was the go-to club, but now you speak to young kids and everyone wants to sign for Exeter City.","That says a lot about the club. You get the chance here – there’s no other team where you get the chance to show what you can do other than Exeter City. I think that says a lot and the coaching you get here shows in the players are coming through. You’ve only got to look at Ethan Ampadu and Jack Sparkes, who’s only just left school, being capable enough to play amongst the first team. I can’t say you’d have had that going back five or six years.",Every year they’re developing and it’s scary to think how good the nine-year-olds are going to be when they’re fit and ready to play men’s football.,"Paul Tisdale: I think Jordan’s being very modest. He’s a fabulous player and of all the players we’ve had come through the academy, he’s one of the best of them. I just don’t think he looks like what people think a centre-half should do in order to play in the Championship. If he was Spanish, he’d probably be in the top league.","In this country, to be a centre-back people tend to think you need to be six foot three and a bit ungainly, when actually he’s got a lot more. Football’s not that complicated and I think Jordan’s very modest – he’s certainly comfortable to play in League Two, if not League One or the Championship, he just doesn’t look like a Championship centre-half, sadly, although I think he’s better than most of them.","We’ve had so many players coming through the academy. I think there’s a number of reasons why the production line is speeding up with better quality players – it’s the mean average, it’s not one or two because we’ve had terrific players who’ve come through before, like Dean Moxey, George Friend or Liam Sercombe. There’s been lots of good players who’ve come through but now it’s the quantity of them and the mean average – it’s not just one, there’s a number every year.","That average is going up and up and up and it all comes back to that commitment to do it. You hear so many clubs say they’re going for a youth policy but it takes years. It takes 10 years to even get to the starting line – you can’t do it in one or two years as you’ve got to attract the nine-year-olds, and you can only do that if the parents are convinced that that club is right for their young chap, who’ll spend four nights a week there during their teens and then they’ll get to a first-team decision, made a professional and, when they get to that point at 19 or 20 and it’s not all been a waste of time because the manager will play them if they’re good enough.","Not only will they play them but, when they’re having a bad time, he’ll stick with them and keep playing them, like we did with Ollie Watkins when he had his ups and downs. You only do that if you commit – off the back of that commitment the academy will then have the confidence to do it.",It’s led from the board right the way through and everyone commits to it and that’s why it takes 10 years.,"Jordan’s absolutely right, there’s no other choice now but to go to Exeter City if you’re in the South West because you know it’s the right environment, right culture and, when it comes to the crunch, you’ll get selected. A player leaves and before the club looks to buy another player or sign a player, they look to their own players first – there’s not another club who does it or comes close.","Jordan’s very modest but he’s one of those one per year that we had – the difference is now that we’ve got more Jordans, they’re more plentiful. Plus they’re all left-footed somehow, I’m not sure why.","We’re very lucky to have that commitment. In order to have the coaching and the opportunity, you need to commit, as it will go right through the club. That’s the reason and that’s the beauty and upside of our model – there are some parts that are very frustrating and some that are enormously rewarding and satisfying, and that’s one of them, it needs to be said."

Barry Rawlyk has won 50 per cent of Saskatoon's BRIT championship titles.,"University of Saskatchewan Huskies head coach Barry Rawlyk, shown here during Ron and Jane Graham Shootout basketball tournament action earlier this season at the PAC in Saskatoon. Liam Richards / Saskatoon StarPhoenix",It’s an incredible stat.,"While Saskatoon has won only six Bedford Road Invitational Tournament (BRIT) titles in 50 years, Barry Rawlyk was part of three of those as head coach of the Holy Cross Crusaders.","“I’ve never really thought of that,” admitted Rawlyk, now the head coach of the University of Saskatchewan Huskies men’s basketball squad, in an interview this week.","Rawlyk remembers all three of those elusive BRIT championship titles. Each one was different, each one separate. All of them “very different and unique situations,” he recalls.","“I never really looked at it as a series of three times,” said Rawlyk, who was honoured as the special guest during the opening ceremonies of this year’s 51st BRIT edition, which wraps up Saturday in Saskatoon.","“We were fortunate to have a lot of good players to be able to do that, string together some really good performances there. There are lots of memorable times when we didn’t win, too.”","Even so, Rawlyk has had a hand in 50 per cent of Saskatoon’s championships and nobody from Saskatoon can say the same, as longtime BRIT volunteer and enthusiast Kelly Bowers knows too well.","“This year’s special guest is very, very deserving,” Bowers said of Rawlyk, who was a guest speaker at the annual BRIT breakfast Friday morning.",“An outstanding coach.”,"Indeed, Rawlyk was named the BRIT coach of the tournament a record four times.","As a high school student, Rawlyk played for the E.D. Feehan Trojans and got to play in BRIT once. He spent a couple of decades as a coach in the Saskatoon high school ranks with most of that time spent at Saskatoon’s Holy Cross High School before a transfer to St. Joseph High School.","“They’re obviously different perspectives,” said Rawlyk, comparing his BRIT experience as coach and player. “I guess, as a coach, I had a much broader scope of experience there so I’d have to say as a coach, probably, I enjoyed the BRIT (more).”",Rawlyk says there’s a lot of “special moments” that happened during his time at BRIT.,One of his favourite moments is still stored on a VHS video tape back at home.,Rawlyk fondly remembers the second time Holy Cross won BRIT. The Crusaders had won their first title in 1997. Their second championship came six years later in 2003.,"“I remember when we won it again, the gym was packed and I remember all the Holy Cross fans just flooding the floor — it was just pandemonium,” recalled Rawlyk.","“It was a great moment in high school sport. You don’t see too often that level of enthusiasm. It was a really hotly contested game and the reaction of the fans was pretty good. I think I have it on an old VHS tape somewhere, still from the Shaw TV broadcast. I just remember looking at that and going, ‘Wow, that was quite a response.’ It was kind of a spontaneous rushing of the floor.”","Another BRIT memory that stands out for Rawlyk is a loss to Mowat, British Columbia.","“We had the game won,” said Rawlyk, still shaking his head, “and ended up losing.”","With a few seconds left in the game, a Holy Cross player got a steal and went for a successful layup to put the Crusaders up by three points. It left three seconds or so on the clock.",Mowat came down the court and pulled victory from the jaws of defeat.,"“I knew it was going to happen; I could feel it happening,” said Rawlyk. “Their guy was over by the score table — he was on the sideline; we had him trapped on the sideline — and he literally jumped into the air, threw the ball up and he landed on the score-table. I was standing right beside him and I thought, ‘Yep, that’s going in.’ The ball went in, a three-pointer, to send the game into overtime and we lost in overtime.”","However, Rawlyk would later nail a three-pointer of his own. For the Crusaders, it’s three and counting.",The key to the BRIT hat-trick?,"“The support of the school and the fans — and a lot of good luck,” he explained. You’ve got to be lucky to be good and good to be lucky. We were fortunate but, at the end of the day, I put it on the players. We had a lot of good players.”","BRIT is a unique tournament with shorter games, a somewhat unbalanced draw and short turnarounds for games.","“But the hoop is the same height and the court is the same length, and all that stuff,” countered Rawlyk. “The thing that makes it an unique event is all the sheer energy of the crowd and the environment is pretty unique to high school basketball. I don’t think you run into too many basketball events, of any description in Canada, where you’ve got that kind of enclosed environment with the crowd so enthusiastic and so many distractions, as it were, going on – the half-time shows and all the hoopla that surrounds the event. The people at Bedford have done a great job of building that event. Yeah, the games are a little shorter and they’re compacted at times, because there can be a short turnaround. It’s tough. It’s a tough tournament to win because of the short turnaround between games.”","Rawlyk says he isn’t surprised that Saskatoon has won only six BRIT titles in 51 years. Besides Holy Cross, only the host Bedford Road, Mount Royal and Walter Murray are Saskatoon-based BRIT winners.","“I think it speaks to the level of talent they’re bringing in to the tournament,” said Rawlyk. “The out-of-town competition that comes in is very stiff, so I’m not surprised by that at all.",“It’s speaks to the competitive level of teams they bring in.”,dzary@postmedia.com,,Choose among a variety of subscription packages and stay up to date with convenient home delivery and our on the go digital e-edition.,© 2019 Wallaceburg Courier Press.
